This story is from March 10, 2002  new delhi: the bjp-led central government has begun exploring the possibility of permitting aEUR~bhoomi pujaaEUR(tm) at ayodhya, after the kanchipuram shankaracharya on thursday night promised a high-level meeting chaired by the prime minister that, if allowed, he would ensure the ceremony would be aEUR~aEUR~symbolic, without building materials, carved pillars or concentration of karswewaksaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). the shankaracharya has already conveyed this to the all-india muslim personal law board, and said that the question of handing over the so-called undisputed land will be dealt with after march 15, but their response is forthcoming. government sources said besides ensuring the security situation in ayodhya was conducive, muslim approval was essential to aEUR~aEUR~sellaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) the aEUR~pujaaEUR(tm) to the bjpaEUR(tm)s allies and the opposition. meanwhile, vhp cadres have not taken kindly to ashok singhalaEUR(tm)s promise in his capacity as managing trustee of the ramjanmabhomi nyas that the court verdict in the ayodhya case would be obeyed. the promise may have made it possible for the government to consider allowing the aEUR~pujaaEUR(tm), but vhp cadres see it as a sell-out. and so on friday, vhpaEUR(tm)s international president vh dalmia took two steps back: he said the vhp would obey the court verdict, but if it went against the rjn, the aEUR~dharmacharyasaEUR(tm) would decide the next step. asked if he was not contradicting singhalaEUR(tm)s statement on thursday that if the verdict went in favour of the muslims, the garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum) location would be changed, he evaded a direct reply, only repeating that he was certain the verdict would be favourable to the rjn. much spadework behind the scenes is understood to have been done by spiritual leader sri sri ravi shankar. the guru reportedly held extensive discussions with vhp leader ashok singhal and persuaded him to give the clearest possible written commitment that his organisation will abide by the court verdict. sri sri ravi shankar is also said to be holding parleys with a cross section of muslim leaders to find a durable settlement to the ayodhya crisis. while dalmia began the aEUR~aEUR~damage controlaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) process, vhp joint general secretary onkar bhave said the aEUR~bhoomi pujanaEUR(tm) would be incomplete without shifting building materials, carved pillars and at least 2,000 karsewaks. aEUR~aEUR~we are still bargaining with the government on this,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he said and added that the vhp still wanted an assurance on the handing over of the acquired land before march 15. simultaneously, 14 bjp mps from up held out a veiled threat of confrontation with the government. in a letter to the pm on thursday, they said the aEUR~aEUR~anger among people is increasing, and soon it would be manifested against governmentaEUR(tm)s hitler-like tactics on streets.aEUR minister hints at lifting of curbs.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 1, 2002  lucknow: the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) on thursday gave a call for a countrywide bandh on march 1 in wake of the ghastly torching of ram sevaks in godhra (gujarat). the organization said it would abide by the courtaEUR(tm)s decision on the ayodhya issue, while simultaneously maintaining that transportation of the carved pillars to the disputed site would begin on march 15. it has also announced the holding of aEUR~shraddhanjali sabhasaEUR(tm) from february 28 to march 3 at all district headquarters of the vhp. one such sabha was held in lucknow on thursday. addressing a press conference, the vhp kshetriya sangathan mantri and up-uttaranchal in-charge purshottam narain singh said the organization and the sant samaj would abide by the courtaEUR(tm)s directives on the controversial ayodhya issue and in the same breath said that one lakh ram sevaks would begin the task of transporting pillars from march 15, the deadline set by the vhp for temple construction. he added that the ruling of the court should come soon and expressed confidence that it would be in favour of the vhp. however, singh tied himself in knots when he said that muslims were responsible for setting fire to three bogies of the sabarmati express which resulted in the death of 14 children, 16 women and 27 men, but could not explain what enabled him to come to the conclusion. by way of explanation he said the incident was part of a pre-conceived conspiracy as the incident took place after the train had passed through a muslim-dominated area. the vhp leader slammed prime minister atal behari vajpayee and union home minister lk advani for asking the vhp to take the aEUR~andolanaEUR(tm) back and for placing obstacles in the movement of the ram sevaks, but maintained a studied silence when queried if the stand of the two leaders on vhpaEUR(tm)s ayodhya andolan was anti-hindu. he also came down heavily on caretaker chief minister rajnath singh for sealing the borders of ayodhya and putting the ram sevaks to great hardship. he remarked that the present atmosphere in the temple town was reminiscent of the times of mulayam singh yadav.	0	0	0	0	0
"This story is from March 8, 2002  lucknow: even though the vhp has given in writing to maintain status quo at the disputed land in ayodhya, no one is ready to take the vhp undertaking seriously. there are several instances in the past, including demolition of babri mosque on december 6, 1992, when the vhp did a volte-face. contradicting statements emanating from the vhp camp are only adding to the confusion. a senior vhp leader, who was part of crucial deliberations in delhi, himself admitted this when he told the times news service that aEURoethe agreement does not hold any meaning until signed by the prime minister and others involved in delhi talks.aEUR and no written agreement has so far reached in this regard. aEURoewhy should we take talks seriously then?aEUR quipped the vhp leader. in fact, through the undertaking, the vhp seems to have laid a trap for the prime minister so that vajpayee is forced to get clearance from nda allies for handing over the 43-acre undisputed land to the ram janambhoomi nyas (rjn) by june 2, the last day of 100-day ongoing aEUR~purna ahuti yajnaaEUR(tm). and vhp undertaking is not for a song. the barter is that the pmo would expedite the ayodya court cases and agree to accept their three main demands viz aEUR"" symbolic aEUR~shila pujanaEUR(tm) at the undisputed land on march 15; handing over of 43-acres of undisputed land by june 2 and withdrawal of forces/lifting of ban on entry of ramsevaks in temple town. the vhp gameplan is to start the temple construction on 43-acres of land so even if court verdict goes against them, the physical possession of the disputed land remains with them. aEURoethe prime minister had gone back from his words once. we want to put everything in black and white this time so that the entire nation comes to know who backtracks,aEUR disclosed the senior vhp functionary pointing to pmaEUR(tm)s lies on so-called earlier talks. the delhi declaration is yet to be signed and made official. but vhp is not relying on what went on in delhi in the last three days. senior vhp leaders have been directed to rush to the temple town to go-ahead with arrangements for march 15 programme of taking carved pillars to the disputed site. however, the vhp would take a final decision on the march 15 programme in a meeting of 51-member mandir nirman samiti to be held in ayodhya a day before. aEURoewhether or not we perform symbolic aEUR~shila pujanaEUR(tm) or take all carved pillars to the disputed site as originally planned, will be decided by the samiti members on march 14 after taking into consideration the response from the pmo on our three demands,aEUR warned the vhp leader. the veiled vhp threat is a serious concern for all. in the past too they had gone back from their promises. aEURoepeople of the nation have not forgotten 1992 babri mosque demolition. how could they be trusted?aEUR points jafrayab jeelani, convener all-india babri masjid action committee. aEURoemembers of the the mandir nirman samiti would perform the aEUR~pujanaEUR(tm) to purify the land. aEUR~shila pujanaEUR(tm) would begin once carved pillars are consecrated at the temple construction site,aEUR disclosed a vhp fuctionary about march 15 programme. the vhp has cleverly turned the table on the prime minister aEUR"" a 1990-like confrontation or a peaceful symbolic aEUR~shila pujanaEUR(tm) on march 15 aEUR"" vajpayee has to select one of the two conditions. and either way, the vhp seems to have scored over others during delhi negotiations, turning its face-saver into a victory even after a climb down."	0	0	0	0	0
"ahmedabad: the violence-hit state of gujarat was gradually returning to normal prompting authorities to focus on relief of 56,000 people rendered homeless in the communal orgy. army continued to patrol sensitive areas, though no major untoward incident was reported from riot-affected districts of panchmahal, surat, baroda, ahmedabad, sabarkantha, mehsana, banaskantha and kheda in the last 24 hours, police said. the curfew, which was imposed in over 40 places, was being gradually relaxed, though night curfew remained in force as a precautionary measure, they said. in ahmedabad city, night curfew was in force in five police station areas, police added. rising steadily, the toll now stands at 667, including the 62 persons who died in the attack on the sabarmati express on february 27. two persons were stabbed in ahmedabad on thursday one of whom later succumbed to injuries, showing that the violence which entered its second week was still far from over. the stabbings took place on relief road, one of the busiest market places of the city. official sources said the death toll in the attack on the train at godhra had risen from 58 to 62 with the death of four persons who were seriously injured in the attack which sparked off widespread reprisals across the state. figures available at the police control room in the state capital state that 820 persons with serious injuries were still admitted to various hospitals, many of them in a critical condition. almost 157 of the deaths have taken place in stabbings and the rest have succumbed to burn injuries and gun- shots. ten bodies were recovered from a village well at ajanwaga in godhra district on wednesday. the victims were reportedly taking shelter in a primary school when they were surrounded by a mob and thrown into the well. official statistics say that 99 persons have been killed in police firing. the security forces have fired 5,176 rounds of ammunition on mobs as well as 7,276 teargas shells. as many as 2,459 houses, 2,082 shops, 1,084 cabins and 448 vehicles, including 12 buses, have been set on fire. additional chief secretary ashok narain said: ""the toll is going to be higher because more bodies are being found."" at the same time, the situation is largely quiet in gujarat over the last two days, but for stray incidents of violence in ahmedabad and other parts of central gujarat. in the chota udepur area of vadodara district, where a policeman who was escorting some families to safety was shot by his own rifle by a mob on tuesday, the situation is said to be still very tense. a spokesman for the army''s corps of electrical and mechanical engineers (eme), which is deployed in vadodara, said one column of the army was sent to chota udepur on thursday evening to control the situation on the request of the state government. the sudden spurt in the death toll from 544 to 607 between wednesday and thursday is the result of many more bodies having been found in godhra and the count being revised in ahmedabad. official figures suggest that in ahmedabad, as many as 28 more deaths have been added to the tally during the 24 hours, taking the total death toll in the communal flare- up in the city alone from 243 to 271. but there was no official explanation available for this upward revision. in godhra, the figure was up from 59 dead on wednesday to 69 on thursday. this excludes the 58 dead in the train burning incident. in sabarkantha, the figure of those dead has gone up from 30 to 34. well-placed sources said bodies in isolated rural areas still remain to be searched. related storiesA gujarat gradually returns to normalcyA choice of judge for probe opposedA gujarat congress wants modi booked under poto    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	1	0	1	0	1

"This story is from March 2, 2002  bathinda: the massacre of ram sewaks at godhra was a premeditated terrorist act and the subsequent violence in ahmedabad was the anger of the people, said rss chief k s sudarshan, on saturday. matters were spinning out of control due to the failure of the bjp-led nda government in putting a check on isi-trained terrorists and finding a solution to the ayodhya issue, he added. sudarshan felt it was the pseudo-secularism of political parties, particularly the communists and congress, that was a stumbling block in finding a solution to the ayodhya issue and handing over land at ayodhya to the vhp. it was the union government''s delay in handing over this land to the vhp that had forced the latter to announce its plan of temple construction from march 15. ""on march 12, last year, the prime minister assured us of a solution, but when nothing materialised and nor did the government seem interested, the people''s patience ran out and the vhp planned to take the carved stones to the acquired land,"" said sudarshan, talking to mediapersons here, on saturday. he was in town to attend a three-day state level camp of rss volunteers at dav college here.

This story is from March 10, 2002  ahmedabad: for a soldier being killed on the battlefield is best sacrifice and for a sincere employee to lay down his life while performing his duty is also the same. the gory incident at bapunagar telephone exchange speak volumes of the valour shown by brahamdev hariprasad mishra, a watchman of the exchange, who preferred death rather than allowing a violent mob to enter the 58,500-line exchange of the eastern industrial belt which witnessed one of the worst communal violence in the aftermath of attack on sabarmati express at godhra railway station. perhaps unaware of the violence that had erupted in adjoining naroda and chamanpura, mishra was sitting on a charpoy at the main gate of the electronic telephone exchange. suddenly a mob of around 200, armed with swords and petrol canes, rushed towards the exchange which was their target. sensing trouble, mishra swung into action and locked the gate and started shouting for help. but it seemed there was nobody to listen to his screams. someone from the mob jumped the compound wall and asked for the keys which he was holding tight. but mishra did not surrender and the infuriated assailant brandished a sword and chopped off his hand. a profusely bleeding mishra tried to defend himself and prevent the mob from setting the exchange on fire which would have resulted in the disruption of the communication link in areas where the army was assisting the local administration in controlling the worst-ever communal disturbances that rocked the city. the dutiful watchman was rendered helpless as more people jumped over and doused him with petrol and set him on fire. by this time another lineman, ramshrey sarbjeet ray, had reported for duty and he saw mishra in flames. within seconds, he too was burnt alive. the watchman and the lineman sacrificed their lives while preventing the miscreants from carrying out their sinister designs. the telecom department has in recognition of the exemplary courage shown by the watchman decided to honour him posthumously with the ''sanchar vir'' award. an ex gratia of rs 5 lakh has also been announced for his family. similarly, lineman rai would be paid an equal amount as compensation. chief general manager of gujarat circle p k chanda told tnn that the government would also provide jobs to one of their family members on compassionate grounds.	0	0	1	0	1

This story is from March 2, 2002  patna: coal and mines minister ram vilas paswan on friday condemned the intransigence of the vhp and accused it of aEURoecreating an unnecessary tension in ayodhya over ram mandir issueaEUR. aEURoethis has resulted in the killing of innocent people amid communally surcharged atmosphere throughout the country, particularly in gujarat,aEUR paswan added. he was talking to mediapersons here at jayprakash narayan international airport, on his his arrival from delhi on a dayaEUR(tm)s visit to patna for addressing a meeting of his outfit, the dalit sena. he said the entire atal behari vajpayee government is aEURoecriticising and condemning vhp for its stand on the construction of ram mandir that violates the order of the judiciary regarding maintenance of status quo on the issue.aEUR vhp, he said, should not make the construction of ram mandir at ayodhya an issue when the matter is pending in the court. its setting of the deadline for starting the temple construction from march 15 has generated the tension, he added. paswan condemned the burning of train passengers in godhra and subsequent killing of a large number of people in gujarat. the union government has deployed army to control the ugly situation, he said, adding that the army must deal with the situation firmly. aEURoedeployment of the army in riot-affected areas to control internal strife has created a problem as the country needs them urgently to protect our borders in view of the surcharged atmosphere there,aEUR he said, and appealed to both the communities to shun violence and create communal harmony for the sake of unity and integrity in the country. paswan refuted the allegation that the vajpayee government was responsible for creating such a situation because of mishandling of the ayodhya issue. he said the union government, from the very beginning, made it clear to the vhp that the matter was in the court and solution to the vexed issue must be found either by consensus or wait for the court verdict. he expressed surprise over the stand of the vhp that the government should hand over a portion of land to ram janma bhoomi trust for the construction of the temple. aEURoehow can the government give possession of disputed land to a particular trust when the matter is in the court. it will antagonise another section,aEUR he said. paswan ridiculed the vhp for making the temple issue more and more serious and also for complicating such a sensitive matter by pressing for the construction of the temple. aEURoenot only the people of the country, but many members of the vajpayee government who were on the forefront for the temple construction, are more serious about ram bhagwan. sadly, the vhp is creating tension in the name of construction of temple for bhagwan ram,aEUR he lamented.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 10, 2002  mumbai: the vhp, which claims that ayodhya is like its mecca, madina and rome, wonaEUR(tm)t deign to ask what the residents of this mecca feel. but thereaEUR(tm)s one group of crusaders who have decided to do just that. fed up of aEURoesitting by like cowards, waiting for doomsdayaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) kumar prashant, journalist and close associate of jayaprakash narayan during the aEUR~sampoorna krantiaEUR(tm) movement in bihar, a few senior gandhians such as thakurdas bang and a band of young members of the rashtra yuva sanghatan (made up of jpaEUR(tm)s followers), decided it was time to intervene in the dispute. after a year of preparation, they decided on a long march which would begin at raj ghat and culminate on january 30, gandhijiaEUR(tm)s death anniversary, in ayodhya. their proposal to the residents of ayodhya was simple: aEURoeayodhya ka faisla ayodhya ke haath.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) this was the message they spread on their delhi-ayodhya yatra as they passed through meerut, aligarh, mathura, agra, kanpur, lucknow, allahabad, benares, azamgarh and faizabad. the concept seemed odd to everyone. aEURoehow can ayodhyaaEUR(tm)s residents decide on such an important matter?aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) was the reaction of many. prashantaEUR(tm)s answer was aEURoewho can? do the vhp or the babri masjid action committee represent us?aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) aEURoelet the court decide,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) was a common refrain, but prashant found that fraught with danger. aEURoethe judges have to decide whether a ram temple existed at the very spot where the babri masjid stood. both sides have presented truckloads of documents. it will take the court years to go through them. besides, the vhp has already said it wonaEUR(tm)t accept the verdict. is any government likely to force them to accept it? should the credibility of the courts be allowed to be eroded? this is a political battle, should we force the court to resolve it?aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) ayodhya had become a money spinner for all concerned, says prashant, pointing out how the two lawyers representing both sides travelled to court together and shared a cup of tea after the daysaEUR(tm) hearings. except of course for the people of ayodhya, who have been adversely affected. hindus control the temples and the trade and both these depend on pilgrims. aEURoesince 1992, the number of pilgrims has come down to 10 per cent of the original. there are no cooks left in some temples because there arenaEUR(tm)t any pilgrims.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) the team found the people of ayodhya living in terror, aEURoethe terror of the hindutvavadis and the mahants, who move around with commandosaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). at a function organised by the team,ayodhyaaEUR(tm)s children depicted republic day by showing parliament house flanked by a trishul dripping blood on one side and a bombthrowing terrorist on the other. aEURoethe people of ayodhya have to decide the matter because their lives depend on it,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) said prerna desai of the team. aEURoeneither can they give their children a good education, nor can they concentrate on their business. they have to be on constant alert 24 hours day.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) it was difficult at first to hold joint meeting of the two communities. in a muslim meeting, youth asked angrily whether the team thought the demolition legal, and if they didnaEUR(tm)t, didnaEUR(tm)t justice demand that the babri masjid be rebuilt there? the teamaEUR(tm)s answer: aEURoeundoubtedly, but how? will you be able to build it without taking the majority community with you?aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) the same reply was made to the hindus. aEURoethereaEUR(tm)s no way the government can allow the vhp build the temple there. the supreme court judgment, the nda allies, wonaEUR(tm)t allow it. if the temple has to be built, you will have to convince the muslims.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) the consensus that emerged was that both places of worship should be built on the spot. the team had a strong argument favour of this: aEURoeeven if we agree that the idols of ram were not planted inside the temple but suddenly appeared there (in 1949), what does that mean? why did ram lalla choose a masjid appear in? because he felt masjid was the purest place him. and nobody threw him out. such was the maturity ayodhyaaEUR(tm)s residents that they accepted that in a masjid, ram lalla can stay, and in a mandir, the koran can be kept.why should let outsiders divide them now?aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) but how does one keep them out? that was the question mathura too. aEURoewe have accepted both mosque and mandir side side for centuries,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) mathuraaEUR(tm)s residents told the team.aEURoebut what we do once the outsiders start coming?aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) aEURoedonaEUR(tm)t let them,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) was the answer. drawing from gandhiaEUR(tm)s model of decentralised democracy, the team worked out a plan form mohalla-level committees made up only of locals, who would decide matters and neutralise the power of political parties. ayodhyaaEUR(tm)s dalits remained aloof from the dispute, which is why the team felt they had to have a major role in such committees. after 20 days of intensive discussion, on january 30, both communities came together at a public meeting organised by the team the first time in 10 years. aEURoeit is now up to the rest of us to strengthen the hands of ayodhyaaEUR(tm)s residents,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says prashant, as his team leaves once again for ayodhya keep up the campaign. can the people of ayodhya solve the ayodhya dispute?	0	0	0	0	0

""there were tracks in my field like as if a mob had run across, i followed them and found this ... ,"" he breaks down, pointing to the charred remains of his father. but hidusa had kept his word. rajabsa found buried nearby some rs 10,000 stuffed into a polythene bag and even showed us the site! on wednesday, when tnn visited the area the police had found 13 bodies of ghodasar residents brutally slaughtered while attempting to flee on sunday with the burnt remains of their belongings simmering in the wheat fields around jinjhar village. three of these bodies were found dumped across the shedhi canal nearby. after a headcount of the villagers who had escaped, they claimed there was a list of 45 persons still missing, said rajabsa. but the police say, all have been located, either dead or alive. if anyone thought that the ''chun chun ke maarenge'' theory was only for bollywood pot-boilers, the trail of death and destruction between ghodasar and jinjhar proved its manifestation in real life. over 58 houses had been burnt down, borewells that watered the fields and earned kheda the sobriquet of gujarat''s ''greenest district'', were damaged, and several stacks of hay destroyed leaving no fodder for the cattle. the police collected the relatives of the victims and decided on a spot to give them a decent mass burial. but not many of them wanted to go through the gruesome task after seeing the state of the bodies, found three days after the homicide.

"This story is from March 8, 2002  new delhi: the union cabinet met late on thursday evening and recommended presidentaEUR(tm)s rule in uttar pradesh, even as bsp leader mayawati resigned her lok sabha seat and hinted at a new proximity to the bjp as a prelude to a new pact for ministry-making in the state. this comes in the wake of no party in the state being being able to demonstrate to governor vishnukant shastri that it had the backing of the requisite number of mlas to form a stable government. parliamentary affairs minister pramod mahajan said the cabinet, after discussing the governoraEUR(tm)s report, agreed to endorse his recommendation for presidentaEUR(tm)s rule which has been sent to the president for his approval. thereafter, it would have to be ratified by parliament within 60 days. when asked how the government proposed to get it through the rajya sabha, mahajan said, aEUR~aEUR~let us wait and see.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) this statement, along with the press conference mayawati held earlier in the day along with her mentor kanshi ram, before submitting her resignation to the speakeraEUR(tm)s office, is being seen as a sign that the 60 days are not being kept for parliamentary approval but to stitch up a bsp-bjp alliance led by mayawati. at the briefing, after announcing her resignation from the lok sabha, mayawati said she was leaving for lucknow to lead her party legislators and cadres. this is also being read in political circles as an effort to scotch rumours that she might accept a central berth, in return for the bsp extending support to a bjp-led government in up. interestingly, both mayawati and kanshiram welcomed the up governoraEUR(tm)s decision to recommend presidentaEUR(tm)s rule in the state for the time being and admitted they had been meeting bjp leaders. adding credence to the possibility of some understanding having been reached between the bjp and the bsp, mayawatiaEUR(tm)s comments on ayodhya and the communal carnage in gujarat were muted. indeed, the position she took on the cause of the gujarat violence and the centreaEUR(tm)s handling of the ayodhya situation revealed a pro-bjp tilt in sharp contrast to the bsp line in the assembly elections. replying to a question on the ayodhya tangle, mayawati said that while the disputed land should remain with the centre until the court verdict, the so-called undisputed land around the site could be handed over for temple construction. aEUR~aEUR~we have no objection to that,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) she said. mayawati said she had told the prime minister at the all-party meeting on the gujarat situation that since the train attack at godhra had sparked the trouble, there should be an inquiry into the incident as well as the subsequent communal riots. instead, she took a swipe at the congress, saying, aEUR~aEUR~the ayodhya problem had begun with the shilanyas during congress rule.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) she ruled out the possibility of either seeking support from mulayam singh yadavaEUR(tm)s samajwadi party or backing its efforts at government formation. she evaded answering a question on the demand to ban the vishwa hindu parishad, saying, aEUR~aEUR~let there be an all-party meeting on all communal organisations and an inquiry into their activities aEUR""we have to rise above political considerations to decide an issue like that.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm)"	0	0	0	0	0

new delhi: in view of the volatile political situation confronting the country, the ruling national democratic alliance (nda) may look for a successor to lok sabha speaker g m c balayogi, who died in a helicopter crash in andhra pradesh sunday morning, from within the telugu desam party (tdp) to maintain the delicate political equilibrium at the centre.  this is because of the pivotal role of the tdp, which is the second largest party supporting the ruling nda. also, tdp chief and andhra pradesh chief minister n chandrababu naidu enjoys excellent rapport with prime minister vajpayee and the nda leadership.  political observers say the ruling alliance would do nothing to disturb the current political equilibrium at a time when the bjp has suffered in the recent assembly elections and is facing all-round criticism for the handling of the violence in gujarat.  deputy speaker p m sayeed would be conducting monday''s proceedings in the lok sabha. he was the congresss nominee who garnered opposition support to win the post. chances of his elevation to the speaker''s post are considered slim since the ruling alliance would not like to be seen to be surrendering the crucial parliamentary post to the opposition.  among the names being mentioned for the speaker''s post are tdp''s leader in the lok sabha yerran naidu, m venkateswarulu who was minister in the united front government, and m rajaiah, a leading tdp member who, like balayogi, is from backward class. yerran naidu is considered close to the chief minister and was his nominee in the united front governments of deve gowda and i k gujral. he is also among the more experienced of the tdp members in parliament.  incidentally, yerran naidu was the first choice of chandrababu naidu when the party was offered the lok sabha speakership in 1998. his flight from hyderabad was delayed, forcing the tdp to nominate balayogi to beat the deadline for nominations. the opposition was battling for the post, challenging the fragile ruling alliance, which lacked majority support. balayogi''s nomination brought the tdp into the alliance.  a surprise choice and a low-profile man, balayogi was the first dalit to become the lok sabha speaker. he is also the first to die in office. during the three years-plus in office, he belied his critics who had accused him of being unknown and faceless. he handled the business of the house with sensitivity and was re-elected speaker in 1999.  he displayed fairness during the crucial vote that brought down the vajpayee government by a single vote in 1999. he permitted the then orissa chief minister giridhar gomango, who had continued to be a lok sabha member during the six-month period stipulated for allowing him to choose his legislature, to vote on the no-confidence motion against the government. his critics in the nda questioned the political propriety, but could not question the action on legal grounds. the opposition found his dealing of the matter fair.  the speaker''s post is crucial in the country''s constitutional and parliamentary firmament. more so when a coalition government is wielding power at the centre. notionally, the speaker ceases to be member of the party on whose ticket he/she is elected to the lok sabha. the role becomes more important each time there is an impasse between the government and the opposition on any issue. he plays the referee in the political match, without being seen as taking sides.  considering the importance of the post balayogi held and the volatile political situation the country is passing through, top leaders of the government and the opposition would be attending his state funeral.

"This story is from March 2, 2002  ahmedabad: the cradle of india''s freedom movement is locked out. gory scenes of violence, arson and killings seem to have shocked the sabarmati ashram to closed its doors to the world. the apostle of peace is perhaps forgotten in all this frenzy. a white wooden gate, that on other days welcomes visitors from country and abroad, has remained locked since thursday noon, possibly the longest break that the gandhi ashram has taken in the recent past. the huge compound of the ashram-cum-museum aEUR"" a heritage monument that conjures images of mahatma gandhi and his non-violent struggle aEUR"" was steeped in silence on friday. the only activity in the sprawling premises was frolicking squirrels having a field day in the deserted campus. ""we had to close down the ashram because of the tense situation,"" said amrutbhai mody, the secretary of the sabarmati ashram trust. the other convincing factor was that local residents were using the compound to have a look across the sabarmati river at all the smoke billowing out of the burning buildings. scenes of violence, arson and looting were plainly visible and the number of curious onlookers was steadily growing. afraid that the ashram could be damaged by the rampaging vandals and to put a stop on such ""misuse"" of gandhian premises, the trustees have decided to keep the ashram closed till the tension is defused. renowned gandhian chunibhai vaidya, who stays across the street from sabarmati ashram, says, ""the ashram is an epitome of peace and secularism. we cannot allow it to be used for watching violence and killings of fellow men."" ""i am shocked at the gory incidents. undeterred mindless mayhem and break down of law and order suggests that the gujarat violence is under the aegis of the state government. i am unable to contact george (fernandes) or the chief minister. it is still a mystery why despite police and army presence, there is no concerted effort to put an end to this violence. even the media has ignored my appeals to restore peace in the city,"" vaidya said. ""neither the godhra incident can be pardoned nor the selective killings of ahmedabad. i just was told that no less than 50 bodies have been recovered from the bapunagar-himmatnagar area. the inhuman happenings seem a throwback of the partition days. ahmedabad is now a breeding ground for bitter animosity between two communities."" when ahmedabad was gripped by similar circumstances in 1992, albeit of a lesser intensity, vaidya along with more than 1,000 gandhians and localites had organised a peace march. but, this time the situation is more grave and vaidya has not yet been able to do an encore. prakash shah, a gandhian, told tnn: ""a public initiative is definitely called for to calm down the frayed tempers and this unnecessary violence, but present circumstances are not conducive. the state authorities no more take public initiative or intervention kindly unless the idea is generated from within the party rank and files or from the government offices. i had hoped that narendra modi would be on a firm footing after his electoral victory from rajkot-2 but he has turned out to be a complete failure."" the gandhians'' displeasure on the goings on in gujarat was reflected in the deserted premises of sabarmati ashram. ganpatbhai parmar, the only security guard of the ashram, says: ""gandhiji''s ideologies and teachings may have been forgotten in the state, this area between wadaj till the sabarmati ashram has always been alien to communal tensions. closure of the ashram at this juncture has been done as a precautionary measure."" but, with the growing levels of devilry, can one ever be sure?"	0	0	1	1	0
"new delhi: continuing his search for a solution to the ayodhya imbroglio, kanchi shankaracharya jayendra saraswati on wednesday held consultations with a delegation of imams on the issue of handing over the acquired land to ramjanambhoomi trust. the imams led by maulana jameel ahmed ilyasi, president of all india organisation of imams of mosques said that they sought time till march 13 for holding discussions among themselves and arrive at a decision. maulana ilyasi said the imams needed time to delibrate on the issue in view of the fact that the acquired land also consists of some wakf property. stating that both hindus and muslims should abide by the court verdict on the issue, he felt that the government was free to give the acquired land to either the temple or the mosque. shankaracharya stressed that since the court case on the ayodhya issue would take time, it would be better if both communities agreed to consensus on the acquired land. senior pmo official sudheendra kulkarni was present during the deliberations shankaracharya had with the imams. meanwhile, the imams in a memorandum to prime minister atal bihari vajpayee condemned the killings of innocent people in gujarat and said the whole situation in the state was a typical example of total failure of the constitutional authority. stating that mobs indulged in burning the property of muslims, men, women and children, they demanded immediate suspension of the gujarat government and sacking of chief minister narendra modi, police commissioner of ahmedabad and other police officials. ""now it is not very difficult to identify the looters and killers since there are lot of video clipping and the eye witnesses, the culprits must immediately be arrested and booked and be punished under the law of the land"", they said.

new delhi: uttar pradesh governor vishnu kant shastri on tuesday asserted that the supreme court order on the symbolic bhoomi pujan at ayodhya would be implemented and said all security arrangements have been completed.       read this story in...          A A hindi    ''''the supreme court order will be implemented'''', he said a day before the apex court will hear the important issues emerging from the controversial decision of vhp to perform bhoomi-pujan at the disputed site at ayodhya on march 15. shastri was talking to reporters after a 30-minute talk with prime minister atal bihari vajpayee, the first meeting the governor had after the state was brought under president''s rule following a fractured poll verdict. asked about prime minister''s response, he said vajpayee maintained that the supreme court directive should be abided. when his opinion was asked about the proposed puja by vhp, shastri retorted, ''''how can you stop someone from performing worship. today being maha shivratri, people will like to offer prayer. can you stop them?''''. ''''ayodhya being a pilgrim centre, pilgrims always come...can supreme court prevent people from worshipping in their houses and temples'''', he asked. to a question regarding the arrangements for the proposed puja, the governor said that with the forces available with the state, adequate arrangements can be made and necessary steps had been taken. he refuted reports that the state had deployment of troops in faizabad saying that the army had only been asked to remain in a state of alert. shastri also met home minister l k advani and apprised him of the situation in the temple town.

"new delhi: the past few weeks have seen voices emanating from various authoritative sources in pakistan, making the right kind of noises, at least to those that matter. india has, of course, refused to bite the bait. the propositions include the offer of talks for reduction in troop deployment along the border and even flying down to new delhi to do the same by pakistan foreign minister abdur sattar. sattar also recently said in an interview to a newspaper that pakistan would be willing to discuss signing an extradition treaty with india. other voices from pakistan have sought to dismiss any attempt that pakistan might have made to include home minister l k advani''s name in a counter-list to be handed to india or that there was any case against advani for plotting to assassinate mohammad ali jinnah. an invitation has also been extended to advani to visit pakistan, which advani has politely declined. pakistan cricket board chairman tauquir zia has said that pakistan would like to invite india for the golden jubilee celebrations of test cricket in pakistan, which again india has dismissed. in a rare act, pakistan president pervez musharraf praised india as an information technology power house that needs to be emulated and that too live on television during the saarc meeting of information & broadcasting ministers. musharraf followed up his speech with a handshake for i&b minister sushma swaraj, which was reminiscent of the famous vajpayee-musharraf handshake during the saarc summit in kathmandu. further, swaraj, known for her vitriolic ability to defend herself and her country, was allowed to go live on ptv, the official pakistan news channel. india has, of course, chosen to dismiss these attempts by pakistan. the official stand has been: ""there is no change visible at the ground level as far as cross-border terrorism and infiltration is concerned."" according to ministry of external affairs spokesperson nirupama rao, ""this assertion of india is not based on any subjective assessment. it is based on facts."" ""there is tremendous pressure by the us on pakistan to act,"" says defence analyst k subrahmanyam. ""by making the right noises, pakistan is trying to build an image of trying to build bridges with india,"" he adds. officials in the foreign ministry here say that pakistan is following a two-pronged agenda that is high on rhetoric and low on substance. ""they haven''t budged on the issue of the list of 20 terrorists that india has demanded. and they don''t hesitate in poking their nose wherever they can to put india down, like during the gujarat riots,"" says a senior official at the mea. according to officials, pakistan is also desperate that a reduction of troop deployment along the border happens fast as that is pinching its economy hard.

""we are always prepared to resolve the vexed ayodhya issue through peaceful means,"" he said, but expressed doubts over the sincerity of the vhp for a peaceful resolution. he said the muslim community in ayodhya was apprehensive because the police had failed to prevent the influx of ram sevaks there. they continued to reach ayodhya till last night and there are now about 5,000 of them in the temple town. jilani said it was the duty of the administration to evict all ram sevaks from ayodhya and maintain status quo at the disputed site. referring to the communal violence in gujarat, he alleged that the vhp was trying to inculcate a sense of fear among the muslims and said ""no compromise is possible under duress or threat. muslims do not trust the bjp and vhp."" ""the country is governed by the rule of law and not by the whims and fancies of any individual or organisation,"" jilani said.

"new delhi: giving a new twist to the impasse over the disputed site at ayodhya, a petition was on monday filed in the supreme court by a lawyers'' body seeking constitution of a body of eminent people to oversee simultaneous construction of a temple at the site and a mosque at some other place. the petition filed through the united lawyers'' front''s president anis suhrawardy said the ayodhya issue was affecting the secular fabric of the country and hence it was necessary to apprise the supreme court to restrain the government from subjecting itself to the pressure of either vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) or babri masjid action committee (bmac). this could be done by ""constituting a committee of former chief justices, judges, eminent jurists, journalists and people from the field of art and culture belonging to both the communities to undertake the work of construction of ram mandir and simultaneously of a masjid"", said the peitition which is likely to be taken up for hearing on march 13 along with another seeking deployment of army at the disputed site. elaborating its suggestion regarding simultaneous construction, the advocates'' body said ""since there is a general belief of hindu community that disputed site was the birth place of lord rama and since a masjid existed at the site before its demolition, there is no harm that a ram mandir could be constructed over the disputed site. ""on the other hand, the masjid, which was constructed there, is although of special significance to the entire nation especially to the muslim community but has no co-relation with the site of dispute and could be constructed anywhere,"" it said.

""classrooms are converted into bedrooms and practical labs into dormitories. the crpf commandant is the new principal of college and men in khaki students. instead of books, the college library is lined up with rifles and light machine guns,"" quips an associate professor of the college. examination in the college, which were to start from march 13, have been postponed till april 1.

"This story is from March 4, 2002  branding kolkata police ""thoroughly unprofessional"", a high-ranking union home ministry official said that the intelligence bureau (ib) cracked the american center case in spite of kolkata police. the senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, disclosed that kp was deliberately kept in the dark about the hazaribagh operation of january 28 and the decision to hand over aftab ansari to gujarat police - instead of kp - was also intentional. lalbazar learnt about the death of idris - one of the two motorcycle-borne gunmen who shot dead five policemen outside the center on january 22 - in the encounter at hazaribagh from tv news channels like ordinary citizens of kolkata. the official said that kp was not taken into confidence to ensure the secrecy and success of the operation conducted by ib''s anti-terrorism operational unit which flew in commandoes from the crime branch of delhi police. but kolkata - which is geographically much closer to hazaribagh than delhi - was consciously kept out of the picture. ""kp is notorious for leaking information to the press which can compromise special operations. with even seniormost officials shooting their mouths off, we are extremely wary of sharing top-secret information with them or involving them in sensitive operations,"" he said. ""we were shell-shocked by a senior west bengal cid officer telling the press on the day of the attack on the center that he had received a telephone call from ansari in dubai,"" he said. according to the official, asif reza khan''s interrogation by the ib last year had revealed the existence of three isi-backed modules, or subversive units in hazaribagh and two towns in gujarat and uttar pradesh. these modules, he said, were under ib surveillance. ""suddenly, a few hazaribagh-based subversives disappeared from our gun-sights just before the attack on the center. but they were back within a few days. a spate of telephone calls between kolkata and hazaribagh confirmed our suspicion,"" he disclosed. commandoes from delhi, along with local police force, swooped down on a house in hazaribagh''s khirgaon locality at 6.30 am on january 28. idris, one of the two terrorists who were shot dead, gave a dying declaration about his role in january 22 attack - he was the pillion-rider. the rider, sadaqat, is still at large. idris'' dying declaration solved the case in record time - without kp playing any role in cracking the case. ""kp could have claimed some credit if we had involved them in the hazaribagh operation but we decided against it, he said. the entire credit, he said, goes to ib''s anti-terrorism operational unit headed by additional director a.k. doval, a no-nonsense 1968 batch ips officer from haryana who is also referred to as the ib''s sachin tendulkar. he said that before the attack on the center, ib had taken the help of west bengal police to arrest an isi agent called dilshad from darjeeling. ""the darjeeling sp leaked dilshad''s confession to the press about his accomplice in hyderabad. we were lucky to arrest the accomplice despite his name and location appearing in newspapers,"" he said. citing another instance, the official said that details of top-secret cell-phone tapping operations leaked to a kolkata newspaper by a senior police official, set alarm bells ringing in new delhi.

""even if the acquired land is given to the vhp leaders, i and my followers will not take it lying down. what can be constructed, can be finished also,"" he threatened. criticising the vhp, rss and bajrang dal, he said ""they have nothing to do with religion. they are killers who in the name of religion and ram temple kill innocent people."" adhokshajananda, part of a parallel ""endeavour"" by muslim and non-sangh parivar hindu religious leaders to sort out the contentious ayodhya issue, has on tuesday rejected the mediation of rss and kanchi shankaracharya and demanded a ban on vhp and arrest of its top leaders. asked about the solution to the present imbroglio, adhokshajananda said besides waiting for the court verdict, the religious leaders of both the community should sit together and find an amicable solution. informing that he has been talking to the eminent ulemmas to find out the solution, the shankaracharya of goverdhanpeeth said the ulemmas from various parts will be coming to delhi on march 9 to discuss the issue. ""i will inaugurate the meeting,"" he said. emphasising that as a hindu, he would also like to see a temple to be built at the birth place of ram in ayodhya but ""one cannot construct a temple at the cost of and amidst the dead bodies.""

This story is from March 9, 2002  hyderabad: telugu desam party leaders feel that the wife of the late lok sabha speaker g m c balayogi should be nominated to the rajya sabha. according to senior leaders, the issue is likely to figure in the crucial politburo meeting scheduled to be held at the ntr trust bhavan on saturday evening. they feel that this would be the best tribute to balayogi who died in a helicopter crash on march 3. the general opinion in the party is that sending her to the rajya sabha would help them in two ways. one, people of balayogiaEUR(tm)s constituency would feel happy that the government had acted on time and, second, she being a political novice would be spared of hectic political battle in the byelection, particularly when she has yet to come out of the trauma. more over, the political situation at the centre being fluid, it may not be wise to ask her to contest for the byelection to the lok sabha. party leaders say that if the tdp was forced to withdraw support to the nda at any stage, she may have to face two elections in quick succession. asked if the tdp was considering withdrawal of support to the nda, party sources said the tdp would continue to support the government as long as it does not deviate from the nda agenda. the sources said aEURoeas of now, the situation was fluidaEUR. the tdp has made its stand clear that the centre should maintain status quo at the disputed site in ayodhya at any cost. however, the main focus would be on the candidate for the lok sabha speaker and the candidates for the rajya sabha. replying to a question, the source said that there was no question of giving up the partyaEUR(tm)s claim for the post of the lok sabha speaker. aEURoein fact, the bjp too wants that the tdp should put up its candidate. the party however is upset over the manner in which aEURoecertain senior leadersaEUR are lobbying for the post,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) the sources said.	0	0	0	0	0
"This story is from March 7, 2002  ahmedabad: the gujarat chand committee has accused the state government of being involved in the recent violence and demanded its dismissal and the imposition of president''s rule in the state. mufti shabbir ahmed siddiqui of ajma masjid, ahmedabad, while addressing a press conference here on wednesday said that muslims have lost faith in the police and they want the presence of the army. speaking on behalf of the muslim populace in gujarat, the mufti strongly condemned the godhra carnage and supported the government move to apply poto to its perpetrators. he, however, demanded that the same stance should be taken against people responsible for its aftermaths. ""this was not a communal riot, it was a planned conspiracy and murderers were brought from outside ... not only the government, but even the police helped them ... ,"" he alleged. seeking an impartial judicial inquiry into all the violent incidents, including godhra, he said that all those responsible for violence should be punished, regardless of their religion. coming down heavily upon the police for targeting muslims, he said that at many places the police actually transported and helped the rioters. praising modi''s predecessor keshubhai patel for successfully maintaining law and order and peace in gujarat, mufti said that the bjp sidelined him for losing a seat, but is not asking the current chief minister to step down despite the riots. he claimed that there were over 1,000 deaths due to the violence ""organised"" by the home ministry, which deactivated the police. mufti alleged that the bjp is treating muslims as second-class citizens, as a result of which they feel insecure."	0	0	1	0	1
"new delhi: amid massive protests by narmada bachao andolan (nba) activists, booker prize winner arundhati roy was on wednesday sent to the tihar jail to undergo one-day ""symbolic"" term ordered by the supreme court.        read this story in...          A A hindi    a bench comprising justice g b pattanaik and justice r p sethi said roy ""scandalised and lowered the dignity"" of the apex court. it also fined her rs 2,000. if she does not pay the fine, roy would have to undergo three months'' imprisonment. initially, contempt action was initiated against nba leader medha patkar, roy and lawyer prashant bhushan for raising slogans against the court and its judgment on the sardar sarovar dam in 2000. the court dropped the proceedings against bhushan and patkar but action against roy continued as she refused to apologise for certain remarks in her affidavit, which the court found to be contemptuous. ""as the respondent (roy) has not shown any repentance or regret or remorse, no lenient view should be taken in the matter"", the bench said. ""however, showing the magnanimity of law by keeping in mind that the respondent is a woman, and hoping that better sense and wisdom shall dawn upon her in future to serve the cause of art and literature by her creative skill and imagination, we feel that the ends of justice would be met if she is sentenced to symbolic imprisonment...."" in the recent past, the then up chief minister kalyan singh was ordered ""symbolic"" imprisonment for allowing construction of toilets near the disputed mosque-temple structure in ayodhya before it was demolished in december 1992. referring to the media reports, the bench said the press enjoys no separate freedom of speech. ""their freedom of speech is the same as that guaranteed to the common man under article 19 of the constitution which also provides for reasonable restrictions,"" it said. when roy was taken to registrar-general l c bhadoo''s room prior to jail, nba activists shouted slogans ""anyaya nahin, nyaya chahiye"" (we want justice, not injustice). roy issued a hand-written statement, saying: ""i stand by what i said. and i am prepared to suffer the consequences. the dignity of the court will be upheld by the quality of the judgments. the quality of this judgment will be assessed by the people of this country"".

"new delhi: fish rots from the top, and if the ugly events unfolding in gujarat over the past four days are any indication, the same holds true for governance too. even after four days of senseless violence, gujarat chief minister narendra modi is yet to reassure the five crore people of his state that he is the guardian of their lives and property. the past four days have made it clear that the dividing line between the government, the police, the bjp and other fronts of the sangh parivar like the vishwa hindu parishad and bajrang dal have got totally blurred in gujarat. asked about the violence, modi quoted newton''s third law - ""every action has an equal and opposite reaction"" - to virtually justify what is happening. in the case of the lynching of former congress mp ahsan jaffrey, he was quick to point out that it was jaffrey who had first fired at the mob. he forgot to say what a citizen is expected to do when a menacing mob, which has already slaughtered many, approaches him and the police has deliberately not responded to his pleas. when the attack on the train took place on february 27 and the vhp called for a bandh, gujarat bjp president rajendrasinh rana was quick to announce the state bjp''s support for the strike, giving clear signals to the administration that it need not take a hard line against those who enforce the bandh. by noon on thursday, shops owned by muslims were broken open in ahmedabad, rajkot and other cities even as the police looked the other way. at many places, the police mingled with the vandals and pleas for help went completely unheeded. while vadodara police imposed curfew early in the morning, the police commissioner of ahmedabad took time in following suit. it is easy to blame the police commissioner, but there are clear indications that his hands were tied by the minister of state for home, gordhan zadaphia, who has risen from the ranks of the vhp. zadaphia is a supporter of the international general secretary of the vhp, pravin togadia, at whose insistence the home portfolio was given to him when modi became chief minister. it was only when the situation had gone sufficiently out of hand that the police tried to intervene. but by that time, it was too late and the mobs had swelled to enormous proportions. the sparse police presence looked like a drop in this ocean of violence. and what did the chief minister have to say about what was happening? he said, ""the five crore people of gujarat have shown remarkable restraint under grave provocation."" he went on to blast the godhra killing of kar sevaks while brushing aside the equally brutal retaliation that was taking place against muslims. if the central government was speaking about not allowing vhp activists into ayodhya, modi said that police protection should be given to them en route. if the people of gujarat were expecting a reassuring face, what they got was a sangh pracharak on television who has perhaps forgotten he is now chief minister. incidentally, modi has yet to see mobs because he has not visited the worst-affected areas. if only he had the courage shown by george fernandes, who carried on his tour of the riot-hit areas despite being mobbed and stoned.

This story is from March 2, 2002  mumbai: former mumbai police commissioners such as julio ribeiro, satish sahney and r.h. mendonca are the leading lights of the mohalla committees that have put pressure on the police to maintain peace and harmony.  ``it is important for citizens to monitor and criticise the police leadership,'''' says mr ribeiro, who also served as director-general of thegujarat police during the 1984 riots in ahmedabad. he managed to curb the riots by promptly locking up the vhp rabble-rousers as well as the criminal elements in the minority community, bootleggers and gambling den owners.  taking mr ribeiro''s argument further, mr sahney says that civil society ought to realise that it needs a permanent mechanism outside the administration to diffuse crises arising out of communal problems. the mohalla committees set up in mumbai after the post-babri riots are one such mechanism. in fact, their effectiveness has been boosted by the fact that they are also apolitical.  one way in which civil society has kept up the pressure on the mumbai police is to pursue the implementation of the justice srikrishna report. ``policemen must be made to realise that they will have to face the consequences of their biased and unprofessional conduct,'''' says shakil ahmed of the nirbhay bano andolan, which monitors police functioning in the slums.  r.d. tyagi, joint police commissioner of mumbai during the post-babri riots, was booked in 2001 for his role in the suleiman bakery firing case of 1993 despite being rewarded with the mumbai police commissioner''s post in 1995. this was largely possible because of the persistence of grass-roots activists such as mr ahmed.  islamic scholar asghar ali engineer, who has studied several communal riots in india, admits that the resolve of civil society rather than the recommendations of inquiry commissions is what tends to prevent riots. ``the gujarat police has not improved a bit despite the strong condemnation of its role in the 1969 riots in ahmedabad,'''' he points out.  if the mumbai police has done some introspection after the 1992-''93 riots, the credit goes to mumbaikars who made their displeasure clear. ``we acknowledged that we had a problem and went in for sustained treatment,'''' says mr sahney, who is credited with bringing police-muslim relations on an even keel after 1993.  meanwhile, citizens have also realised that their safety lies in maintaining cordial relations with their neighbours. ``mumbai muslims will no longer react to events in a knee-jerk manner,'''' says congressman husain dalwai, citing the manner in which the urdu press here has consistently ignored rabble-rousers.  it is lessons such as these which mumbai can forget only at the peril of another gujarat-like conflagration.	0	1	1	0	0

"This story is from March 7, 2002  ahmedabad: the role of governor sundar singh bhandari, who is expected to send his monthly report to the centre on the law and order situation in the state this week, is coming under scrutiny because of his low visibility all through the violence rocking the state which has claimed nearly 600 lives so far. and now, even the congress is training its guns at bhandari, himself a former rss pracharak, a trait he shares with chief minister narendra modi. says leader of the opposition in the state assembly, naresh raval, ""gujarat has been done in by three bachelors - modi, vajpayee and bhandari"". former chief minister and sitting congress mp shankersinh vaghela says, ""we don''t expect anything much from the three former pracharaks - modi, bhandari and advani - who will clearly take a hindu line"". sources in raj bhavan, however, said that the governor had been collecting information not only from the state government, but also from the districts on the violence that rocked gujarat after the godhra train massacre. normally, the governor sends his monthly report to the centre on the 6th of every month and the present report will be despatched in a day or two. but opposition leaders say there were all indications that the governor will bail out modi instead of criticising the sluggish reaction of the bjp government in trying to bring the situation under control. says vaghela, ""given the fact that bhandari has been a senior functionary of the bjp, i don''t think he will deviate from the official line being taken by the central and state governments. i think there should be rethinking on this policy of keeping pliable governors in states."" raval admitted that he had met bhandari twice during the last week - once with the state congress president amarsinh chaudhary and then again with a delegation of congress leaders from delhi. ""we find that he himself is not getting involved, he should have been pro-active and gone around appealing for peace which he has not done, he should have visited the most-affected areas during the last one week which again he has not done,"" raval said. the governor''s report is eagerly awaited even though the contents are never made public by the raj bhavan or the union home ministry, which receives it because it may fuel pressure from the nda allies for dismissal of the modi government for alleged complicity in the riots and delayed reaction to contain the situation. opposition leaders said there was a need for the governor to be ''objective'', but ""this was too much to expect from bhandari given his pro-bjp track record"". a raj bhavan spokesman denied these charges and said, last wednesday, when the godhra massacre took place, the governor had issued an appeal for peace and communal harmony. since then bhandari is in touch with the chief minister and chief secretary and is getting reports on the situation twice a day. the spokesman denied that the governor was sending ""any special report"" this month and said the report on law and order in the state was a ""monthly routine"". asked when bhandari plans to tour the affected areas, the spokesman said, ""we are still watching the situation""."	0	0	0	0	0
while condemning the gujarat government your party has even demanded presidentaEUR(tm)s rule in the state. but you have always been against presidentaEUR(tm)s rule in any state. comment. in gujarat, the law and order machinery has collapsed. live television coverage has shown to the world what has been happening there. instead of cracking down on the rampaging mobs, the policemen preferred to stand as passive onlookers. even now, the violence remains to be contained. and while the mad crowds roam about freely and fearlessly, the protagonists of communal politics are busy sending more karsevaks to ayodhya. do they want that peace shouldnaEUR(tm)t prevail anywhere? itaEUR(tm)s time the centre wakes up. do you think that the recent wave of violence is a by-product of the election results from the four states that went to polls? nobody can be sure. but it is clear that those who want to bid goodbye to secularism fully and finally have been rattled by the election results. they want the whole nation to be divided on communal lines. but iaEUR(tm)m sure they will not succeed. it has been proved that the vast majority of our countrymen are peace-loving people. they have firmly rejected communal politics. the bjp has not got the mandate to rule up. at the same time, sp too is nowhere near the halfway mark in the 403 member assembly. yet, you have staked claim to form the government. how do you propose to muster majority? we have told the governor that ours is the single largest party and we shall prove our strength on the floor of the house. after all, it is the state assembly, and not the raj bhavan, where trial of strength ought to take place. do you recall what atal behari vajpayee had done when romesh bhandari, the then governor, refused to invite kalyan singh to form the government? vajpayeeji had gone on a hunger strike! the governor hasnaEUR(tm)t yet invited you to form the government. what do you think will happen ultimately? i have made my move. the ball is now in the governoraEUR(tm)s court. but if he doesnaEUR(tm)t call me to form the government, you canaEUR(tm)t blame the people if they think that the bjp, despite their moral posturing after the drubbing in elections, want to rule up through the back door.

"new delhi: if the gujarat pogroms are an angry hindu reaction to the godhra train massacre of february 27, why have muslims been hunted and killed only in that state? do hindus elsewhere identify less with their faith or people? ""the answer is so clear,"" said cpm member nilotpal basu, at the outset of the rajya sabha debate, on thursday, regarding gujarat. the discussion was taken up after the house was adjourned in the morning amidst noisy scenes over gujarat and ayodhya issues. ""nowhere else is the bjp in such power; nowhere else are the vishva hindu parishad and rss so strong."" he and congress chief whip pranab mukherjee, who initiated the debate, as also other opposition members who spoke demanded to know what moral justification chief minister narendra modi had to continue in office. reading out one statement after another of state cm narendra modi as the bloodbath proceeded without let-up, on how things were basically under control and how the mass violence was quite understandable, pranab asked the ruling party if this was their conception of a cm''s job. he and others went on to ask home minister advani if he had measured up to his job at all. clearly not, they said. bjp''s gopalsinh solanki, an mp from gujarat who was chosen to lead the debate from the bjp side, said modi''s administration had actually done a commendable job. the situation was brought largely under control in a little over 72 hours. contrast this, he said, with the congress record of controlling mass violence in the riots of 1969, 1980, 1985, etc., when places remained under curfew for weeks, and even months. later, union law minister arun jaitley made an allied point: data showed the police had actually arrested close to 4,000 rioters over the first five days of violence, and shot dead 98 rioters. against this, he said, the november 1984 anti-sikh pogrom in delhi, then under congress rule, 3,000 people were massacred in one day with the police twiddling their thumbs. jaitley said he condemned the post-godhra rioters and killers without any reservation. it was an inhuman act and it is solely for the police and the government to punish anyone for a crime, not any citizen''s self-appointed task. but so much of the criticism was based on hearsay and falsity, as in the common belief about cm modi having said the violence was an equal and opposite reaction to the godhra killings, when he had never said anything of the sort, jaitley said. stop scoring cheap political points if you want a proper introspection, he said, to approving thumping of desks by advani and other bjp members. the decision to discuss actually took half the day. the entire morning sesion was drowned in shouting and counter-roars, leading chairman krishan kant to twice adjourn the house, with nothing done or decided. sanity prevailed only a little before lunch, with the discussion proceeding after that. kapil sibal of the congress called for a judicial inquiry into gujarat violence and demanded the dismissal of modi, accusing him of connivance in the carnage. mohammad azam khan (sp) created a stir by asserting that if such killings went on, the muslims would have to rethink about their future. advani had no right to continue in his office, he said and sought president''s rule in gujarat.

This story is from March 13, 2002  mumbai: while the nation expects the supreme court to solve the ayodhya tangle, the controversy over a temple and madrasa in old khar village here refuses to die despite the high court ordering the demolition of these roadside structures. on monday morning, the police had to be called as a precautionary measure after nearly 100 protestors, led by two local mlas, gathered outside the temple.the demolition had been ordered more than a month ago by a high court divison bench comprising justice a.p. shah and justice vijaya kapse-tahilramani but it was only on saturday that the civic authorities pasted the demolition notice on the structures. aEURoewe give a 48-hour notice prior to demolition but the job can be done any time after that,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) said j.b. gupta, the officiating asistant municipal commissioner of hwest ward. he said the temple would be demolished as soon as the police gave them protection. the petitioners, the federation of h-west ward citizensaEUR(tm) associations, told the court that the two structures, which had been put up by local residents, had not been demolished despite a series of complaints to civic and police authorities. old khar village is a aEUR~gaothanaEUR(tm) which has been taken over by garment shops after the popularity of the nearby linking road as a readymade clothes centre. based on the correspondence they had with the authorities over a period of two years, the federation alleged that the khar police station was in cahoots with shiv sena activists and a local political leader who had built the temple and the madarsa respectively over the last two years. according to the petitioners, the khar police station repeatedly denied police protection to the civic demolition squad under one pretext or the other. the petitioners also said they apprehended a threat to the life of local resident edwin britto, who had initiated the complaints. mr britto had already been attacked once by vested interests in 1999. aEURoei suspect that an effort is being made by the encroachment mafia to whip up communal passions so that the police gets a convenient excuse to delay the demolitions,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) alleged anandini thakoor of the local mohalla committee. advocate pradeep havnur, lawyer for the petitioners, contended that the small temple blocked the lane leading out of old khar village and had been put up with the purpose of slowly encroaching on the road. as for the madrasa, the petitioners claimed it was an illegal structure which housed a garment manufacuring unit. the police was present at the spot for nearly two hours but no arrests have been made. senior inspector sanjay jambulkar of khar police station played down the incident as a aEURoeminor matteraEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) and said there was no threat to mr brittoaEUR(tm)s life.	0	0	1	1	0

This story is from March 8, 2002  ayodhya: minister of state for home affairs id swami is arriving here on friday morning for an on-the-spot study of problems being faced by over two lakh citizens of the twin townships owing to the security curbs. he will also review the security arrangement made in the pilgrim city in view of the vishwa hindu parishadaEUR(tm)s resolve to shift carved stones from its workshops to ram janmabhoomi complex area on march 15, reliable sources said. citizens of the twin townships have started feeling the heat of traffic restrictions imposed in an area of 100 km around ayodhya. supply of essential commodities in faizabad and ayodhya has sharply declined. though the petrol and diesel are available in ayodhya city, but due to traffic curbs imposed in gonda, basti, sultanpur, ambedkar nagar and bara banki borders the oil tankers have failed to enter in faizabad resulting in drying up of almost all the oil stations there. people have started cancelling important family functions like marriage and engagements which were scheduled during next ten days. the marriage of daughter of ram asre yadav living in the vicinity of ram janmabhoomi complex, which was fixed for march 8, was postponed indefinitely on thursday on the request of the bridegroomaEUR(tm)s family. the bridegrooms family based at lucknow telephonically informed ram asre yadav on thursday that despite their best efforts they failed to get a entry pass from the administration. with bathing ghats of the saryu lying deserted, temples without visitors, shopkeepers awaiting even inaugural sale for the whole day and facing difficulties in freely moving in the city, a new and consolidated wave of sympathy in the local populace is generating for the vhp movement. the businessmen, industrialists, teachers, sadhus and residents of not only the pilgrim city but also of faizabad town have started raising voices for permanent settlement of the issue so that they could live in peace. however, keeping in mind the inconvenience caused to the local people, directives were issued to the authorities that the local residents should not feel bothered by the security arrangements. principal secretary naresh dayal said that procedure of issuing permits for movement of marriage parties have been simplified and efforts were on to ensure that movement of two-wheelers remained unaffected.	0	0	1	0	0

This story is from March 11, 2002  pune: even as gujarat burned in the aftermath of the godhra killings, communally-sensitive mumbai remained peaceful. this has been attributed in large part to the prompt action taken by the 30-odd mohalla committees which have been set up to ensure that religious sentiments do not flare up as they did in the past. pune, too, has been following the example of mumbai by nurturing the mohalla committee movement. the city has no history of sustained communal rioting; the worst was in 1965 during a ganpati festival; others have been confined to pockets of the city. while the anatomy of a communal riot is very complex, and whether a city falls victim to it or not depends on several factors, the mohalla committee concept is one well worth pursuing. around 30 mohalla committees exist throughout pune. they were set up in the wake of the communal conflagration that engulfed neighbouring mumbai ten years ago. aEURoethe 1992 riots in mumbai were a iesson for us and we decided that pune should not become like mumbai.we earnestly started contacting neighbours and soon had excellent co-ordination, not only with the police, but also the municipal ward officers and corporators,aEUR says gita vir, member of the koregaon park mohalla committee. the mohalla committee, she says, tries to build up a sense of belonging in a community.this creates a feeling of unity and hence of security. as the events of gujarat proved last week, the participation of the police would be crucial. deputy commissioner of police (zone one) vinod lokhande, who supervises the aEUR~communally sensitiveaEUR(tm) areas of the city, confirms that the once a month meeting of all mohalla committees is extremely useful in maintaining harmony. aEURoewe urge members not to give vent to their anger no matter what happens. we also teach them precautionary measures, how to defuse rumours and when to alert the police,aEUR lokhande says. essentially, the mohalla committee members could be the voice of reason that is required when the mischief starts. seventy-nine-yearold anantrao vavhal is an active member of the cantonment mohalla committee. in april last year rumours about stone pelting and burning of the quran were doing the rounds and it was essential to defuse the situation. aEURoean angry mob had gathered and we were worried about what would happen. so we took some of the community leaders to the spots where the outrage was supposed to have occurred and showed them that nothing had actually happened. the tension slowly defused,aEURvavhal says. rajni behel is a member of the uday baug mohalla committee and used to work in a mohalla committee when living in mumbai. aEURoewe have already created an excellent atmosphere in the locality and the rule is we mention only our nationality. religion is kept inside the home and we donaEUR(tm)t allow public displays of religious ceremonies,aEUR she says. she is worried, though, that young people are not taking an interest in this activity, a sentiment echoed by vavhal. vir would like much more participation from the public. there are many retired police officials and ex-servicemen who can get involved. aEURoein mumbai, people like (former police commissioner) julio ribeiro have devoted themselves to the movement and it has paid rich dividends.aEUR mohalla committee members in pune say that the police have always been extremely co-operative. julio ribeiro told times news network that aEURoeno police officer wants communal trouble in his area, so the police always encourage such initiativesaEUR. in mohalla committees he is involved with in mumbai, the police are encouraged to participate in health camps and computer classes to build up a feeling of trust among minority communities. ribeiro says every major city must have mohalla committees irrespective of whether it has a history of communal riots or not.aEURoerecently, noted billiards player geet sethi requested me to go to ahmedabad with him so that we can start the movement there.we plan to go this week and start the good work,aEUR says the former aEUR~super copaEUR(tm). he also sounded a word of caution when it comes to recruiting people into the committees. aEURoeonly honest and sincere people who have a good character and no political ambition must be chosen.aEUR aEURC/faraskhana : 13 (70 meetings at chowkis) aEURC/vishrambaug : 43 (79) aEURC/khadak : 19 (112) aEURC/deccan : 21 (65) aEURC/kothrud : 7 (63) aEURC/samartha : 10 (45)	0	0	1	0	0

""adb is only providing technical assistance which both the state and the central governments have been actively involved in the design and implementation."" chief minister antony has consistently denied that the ongoing fiscal reforms which included withdrawing some privileges to the government staff, were a sequel to the adb loan. ""privileges have been taken off since the treasury is empty,"" he has asserted. however, his no. 2 in the cabinet, p.k. kunhalikutty has said that the fiscal reforms were in the offing."	0	0	0	0	0

"new delhi: prime minister vajpayee''s bid to please the temple votaries through the attorney general''s pleadings before the supreme court to allow a symbolic puja and simultaneously assuage nda allies by committing the government to upholding the court verdict ran into rough weather on wednesday. but at the end of the day, the govt appeared to have successfully walked the tightrope without falling off. the vhp and the bjp admitted the centre had ""done its best"", and the allies, who earlier put the pm on the mat for endorsing the vhp line through soli sorabjee''s submissions to the apex court, later upheld the government''s decision to abide by the court order and maintain status quo in ayodhya. the pmo appeared to have reason to pat itself on the back. the court order meant, officials said, that the government could not through an executive action either permit puja or hand over the acquired land for temple construction, and thus could no longer be blackmailed or coerced by the vhp/rjn. however, the centre clearly did not anticipate its stand before the apex court would draw flak from angry allies and would need some smooth talking. then the damage-control exercise began. the pmo and the bjp alike sought to distance the government from sorabjee''s pleadings. first, they pointed out that there was no written submission to the court and withdrew a draft of a statement the pm was to make, on the ground that it wrongly attributed puja details to sorabjee. simultaneously, sorabjee was paraded before agitated allies in the pm''s chamber where the attorney-general said the government had not given him any brief, that his response was based on his understanding of the legal position.

"new delhi: law minister arun jaitley on thursday refuted the opposition charge that police and administration had not acted promptly to control communal riots in gujarat. intervening in a discussion on gujarat incidents in rajya sabha, jaitley said police arrested nearly 4000 rioters during the first five days and fired 2000 rounds to control the situation. as many as 98 people were killed in police firing, he said. the minister said the epicentre of the riots was godhra incident where innocent people travelling in a train were killed. he appealed to members to help in cooling down the atmosphere and not inflame it further by emotional and baseless statements and by creating a fear psychosis. jaitley, who represents gujarat in the house, said the situation in the state could have been brought under control quickly if all sections of people, including the media, had behaved responsibly. the minister referred to a newspaper report quoting gujarat chief minister narinder modi as saying that according to newton''s law of motion to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. jaitley said the chief minister had not made this remark and had sent a written denial to the newspaper, but the damage had been done. similarly, he said, the prime minister had not said as alleged by a member that they did not want votes of a particular community. this allegation had been denied by the prime minister''s office but was still being made by members, jaitley said. the house witnessed acrimonious scenes when the minister tried to compare the role played by police and administration in gujarat to 1984 anti-sikh riots in delhi. jaitely said the members were forgetting what had happened in delhi in 1984 when nearly 3,000 innocent people were killed in one day and neither police nor army was deployed by the then government to control the situation. compared to the 1984 situation, he said, the government and police in gujarat had acted promptly and tried to control violence. this led to a strong protest from agitated opposition members, especially shabana azmi (nom), sarla maheshwari, jibon roy (both cpi-m) and suresh pachauri (cong) who asked the minister not to compare the two incidents. joining them, swaraj kaushal, whose haryana vikas party is supporting the nda government, said jaitely''s comparison was ""bad"". the minister said he was not comparing the two riots but only referring to an earlier similar situation. denying the opposition charge that police had acted in a partisan manner, jaitley said police had rescued members of the minority community in as many as 20 places,including 400 in panchmahal district alone. jaitley appealed to opposition members not to indulge in ""blame-game"" and work unitedly to cool down tempers and bring the situation to normal. he said the opposition would not be able to achieve its political aim as the government was not going to accept their demand for the removal of the chief minister. the maturity of indian society, he said, would be judged not by blaming one another but by learning from what has happened in gujarat so that such incidents do not recur. he appealed to the members, especially those belonging to the minority community, not to create a fear psychosis in the country.

"ahmedabad: the congress has criticised gujarat governor sundar singh bhandari of low visibility, and has said he was trying to bail out the modi government. bhandari is expected to send his monthly report to the centre this week on the law and order situation in the state. the congress is training its guns at bhandari, a former rss pracharak like chief minister narendra modi. says naresh raval, leader of opposition in the assembly, ""gujarat has been done in by three bachelors - modi , vajpayee and bhandari."" former chief minister and sitting congress mp shankersinh vaghela says, ""we don''t expect anything much from the three former pracharaks -- modi, bhandari and advani -- who will clearly take a hindu line."" sources in raj bhavan however said that the governor had been collecting information not only from the state government but also from the districts on the violence that has rocked gujarat after the godhra train massacre. normally, the governor sends his monthly report to the centre on the 6th of every month and the present report will be despatched in a day or two. but opposition leaders say there were all indications that the governor will bail out modi instead of criticising the sluggish reaction of the bjp government in trying to bring the situation under control. says vaghela, ""given the fact that bhandari has been a senior functionary of the bjp, i don''t think he will deviate from the official line being taken by the central and state governments , i think there should be rethinking on this policy of keeping pliable governors in states"". raval admitted that he had met bhandari twice during the last week - once with the state congress president amarsinh choudhary and then again with a delegation of congress leaders from delhi. ""we find that he himself is not getting involved , he should have been pro-active and gone around appealing for peace which he has not done, he should have visited the most affected areas during the last one week which again he has not done"", raval said. the governor''s report is eagerly awaited even though the contents are never made public by the raj bhavan or the union home ministry which receives it because it may fuel pressure from the nda allies for dismissal of the modi government for alleged complicity in the riots and delayed reaction to contain the situation. opposition leaders said there was a need for the governor to be aEUR~objective'' but ""this was too much to expect from bhandari given his pro-bjp track record"". a spokesman of raj bhavan denied these charges and said last wednesday , when the godhra massacre took place , the governor had issued an appeal for peace and communal harmony. since then, bhandari is in touch with the chief minister and chief secretary and is getting reports on the situation twice a day. the spokesman denied that the governor was sending ""any special report"" this month and said the report on law and order in the state was a ""monthly routine"". asked when bhandari plans to tour the affected areas , the spokesman said ""we are still watching the situation"".

"This story is from March 11, 2002  ahmedabad: if at all one needed another example of the all-pervasive lawlessness in ahmedabad during the communal holocaust, this is it. nobody knows who razed the tomb of one of the best-known urdu poets of the state vali gujarati here and a built a road overnight. many small shrines in the city, destroyed during the frenzy which rocked ahmedabad last week, met with a similar fate. while civic officials admit that bull-dozers, cranes and road-rollers were used in the demolition jobs, none in the congress-ruled ahmedabad municipal corporation or the bjp-ruled state government knows where all the equipment came from or who used them. municipal commissioner p panneervel and mayor himmatsinh patel are now being blamed for allowing these places of worship to be razed after being damaged by rioters. but both these civic heads have clarified that the amc had nothing to do with these operations. at the shahibaug underbridge, rioters demolished vali gujarati''s tomb and a hanuman shrine built over it. it was named ''godharia hanuman temple.'' but, even the temple vanished and today you can literally ride over the plot that has a newly laid road. on february 28, when rioters went on the rampage in the city, a dargah alongside the sarkhej road in paldi-bhatta area too was reduced to rubble. with rare alacrity, the plot was metalled and merged with the adjoining road. in this classic whodunnit, from pannervel to patel, from deputy municipal commissioners to the estate officers of amc, nobody has any inkling on who these fly-by-night ""civic workers"" were. even the authorities of the ahmedabad district collectorate, the public works department, roads and buildings department have washed their hands off. ""these areas fall under amc''s jurisdiction,"" they say. pannervel asserts ""i have sent road construction equipment for annual maintenance. apart from a half-km road-laying exercise at paldi-bhatta area, the amc has not carried out any such operation recently."" while who the culprits were remain a mystery, riot victims are steadfast in their belief that it''s the amc''s handiwork. nanumiya rasulmiya malik confronted the mayor on friday, accusing him of showing disrespect to dargahs and mosques and also targeting shops and houses of riot victims. ""we have elected them to the amc. but now these congressmen are bulldozing vandalised dargahs and converting them into thoroughfares. people now tread over these places of worship,"" thundered malik. in the wee hours of march 6, a jcb was used to demolish baluch, a shop-cum-residential complex on naroda road, opposite the naroda police station. this prime-plot housed three single-storeyed buildings built in 1932 that had been set afire by rioting mobs on february 28. this demolition is as mysterious as the rest. neither the police nor the civic authorities has any inkling as to who demolished baluch. deputy municipal commissioner utpal padia told tnn: ""we have not carried out any demolition ever since the riots. amc has no knowledge about baluch''s destruction."" the same story is repeated in bapunagar, saraspur, gomtipur and ishanpur. in ishanpur, a privately owned crane pulled down a historical mosque. isaq ahmed sheikh, vice-president of al amin garib nawaz hospital trust, says: ""dargahs near the bapunagar water tower and in naroda gam were demolished during the riots. mancha ki masjid in saraspur and another in naroda gam was vandalised by rioters. in most cases, the plots were covered with tar overnight."" a senior amc official revealed that ""chances of collusion between lower amc staff and certain vandals cannot be ruled out. but, none of the workshop log books - that record use of earthmovers, bulldozers and other heavy equipment - show any entries to prove this theory."" then, who were these ""invisible"" civic authorities on a demolition spree ? badruddin sheikh, chairman of amc''s standing committee believes it is the state government''s public works department to be blamed."	0	0	1	0	0

"gandhinagar: bjp president jana krishamurthy has rejected the strong yearning of the state party leadership for holding early state assembly polls in gujarat, to take advantage of the communal polarisation after the recent riots. he told newspersons soon after filing his nomination papers for the rajya sabha seat from gujarat that the bjp would not like to take advantage of the situation.

A A hindi    though all reports from gujarat have stressed that the violence is the handiwork of well-organised mobs and that the overwhelming majority of people of all religions want peace, vajpayee largely confined himself to asking the citizens of gujarat to aEUR~aEUR~maintain harmonyaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). he did not warn those organisations and individuals which were indulging in a killing spree that they would be dealt with firmly. nor did he stress that policemen and other officials who fail to protect the people would be punished. the pm described the gujarat carnage as a blot on the nationaEUR(tm)s image which had put everybody on trial and was spoiling indiaaEUR(tm)s image abroad. aEURoethere are times when the country is put to test. the violence in gujarat has created such a condition,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) vajpayee said, adding that whatever may be the provocation, people should exercise restraint and ensure peace. he said he was confident that the current frenzy would be controlled and communal harmony restored in the state. just as india had overcome crises in the past, the country would be able to do so this time as well, he added. recalling the appeal made by leaders of major political parties on friday night, vajpayee said he was sure people belonging to all religions would consider the plea and help the authorities in creating communal harmony.

"This story is from March 12, 2002  gaya: the gaya unit of the janwadi lekhak sangh, on sunday evening organised an interactive programme to promote harmony. story writers, poets, critics and activists gathered on the m g college premises at the call jointly given by shaiwal, the well-known story writer of the award-winning film damul, and poet satendra kumar whose poems on communal harmony and socio-economic justice have been widely appreciated in the literary circles at the national level. speaking on the occasion, story writer hussainul haque said that the hindutva leaders, through their action and words, were, unwittingly, proving jinnah, the founder of pakistan, right. maintaining that the indian muslims are here to stay and contribute to the growth of the beautiful indian mosaic, haque said that the muslims cannot be simply wished away. jinnah, through his much-publicised two-nation theory conveyed the impression that being inherently antagonistic, the hindus and muslims simply cannot live together in the indian subcontinent as they constituted separate nationalities. the vibrant presence of the muslims was a testimony to indian secularism and a loud negation of the jinnah doctrine, said haque. he made a forceful plea for the preservation of the great indian tradition of love, compassion and fraternal fragrance. the story writer also took the muslim clerics to task for what he called an unislamic approach to social issues. when allah did not differentiate between different groups in the distribution of his bounty on the basis of faith, how can the mullahs make the earth narrow for those who did not subscribe to their belief. this tendency on the part of some muslim clerics was a negation of islam and the holy quran, said the author. shaiwal recalled his personal experiences in the making of ""faces after the storm"", an acclaimed documentary made by prakash jha on the aftermath of the biharsharif riots of the early eighties. shaiwal was closely associated with the venture. he also quoted some of the lines from the documentary. har ek qadam pe wahshaton ke saye hain, na jane kaisi ye basti basa rahe hain log (everywhere the shadow of barbarism can be seen, what kind of community was being developed), said one of the inscriptions displayed at the janwadi lekhak sangh function venue. activist t n singh paid tributes to the gayaites for insulating the city from the fast-spreading communal virus. it was an example for others. singh recalled that soon after the ayodhya demolition of december 1992, millions of hindus and muslims simultaneously gathered on either side of the river falgu to offer pindadan and hold ijtama, a mega religious congregation of muslims in a spirit of harmony and fraternal feelings. poet satendra kumar made a forceful plea to marginalise the lumpen elements in the two major communities to allow the voice of sanity to prevail. in his presidential speech, shafi mashhadi, writer and former member of the bihar public service commission, took a dig at the sangh parivar through a couplet: uski in hi baton per mujh ko rashk ata hai, who tegh se marham mere zakham par lagata hai (his craft makes me envious as the sword is used to apply balm on my wounds). those present at the function included gopal lal mahto, dr farasat hussain, faiyaz hali, and brother samuel."	0	0	0	0	0

lucknow: infuriated by the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp)aEUR(tm)s compromise with the centre, ram janambhoomi nyas president mahant ramchandra paramhans das on saturday threatened to boycott the proposed march 15 aEUR~aEUR~symbolic shila pujanaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) programme. talking to the times news network over phone from ayodhya, mahant ramchandra paramhans das said, aEUR~aEUR~i may not participate in the proposed march 15 symbolic shila pujan programme. main wahan jaun ya na jaun ye meri marzi hai. waise ab meri ichcha nahi hain wahan jaane ki (itaEUR(tm)s my decision to go there or not...anyway, i donaEUR(tm)t feel like going there now). but why is the mahant annoyed with the vhp leadership? firstly, he was not taken into confidence when the vhp was forced by the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) and the vajpayee government to give an undertaking that it would abide by the court verdict. when mahant das, who was part of the vhp delegation, came to know about the undertaking, he had threatened to quit. he would have withdrawn from the talks but vhp general secretary acharya giriraj kishore held a press conference to issue a contradiction. secondly, mahant das was peeved at the involvement of the all-india muslim personal board in the talks. another objection apparently was allowing kanchi seer jayendra saraswati to force the vhp accept the compromise formula without the centre giving it any concessions on security relaxation and an assurance to transfer the acquired land in ayodhya to the ram janambhoomi nyas by june 2. thirdly, vhp working president ashok singhalaEUR(tm)s announcement that the vhp has given an undertaking to accept the court verdict saw mahant das packing his bag and leaving delhi. he not only withdrew from the talks but refused to sign the agreement on the compromise formula prepared by jayendra saraswati.

"new delhi: the shiv sena on thursday struck a discordant note on centre''s handling of the ayodhya issue saying that the government had not shown enough urgency in resolving the matter so far and has sought a review of the working of the ayodhya cell in the pmo to ensure a time-bound action plan. party mp sanjay nirupam has written to prime minister atal bihari vajpayee in which he has complained about the lack of adequate urgency in the matter but made it clear that that was his ""humble observation and not a charge"", sources said. in a series of suggestions to the prime minister, nirupam, who had been in the thick of a controversy sometime back over some of his allegations concerning the stock market scam, said that it was time to review the working of the ""so called"" ayodhya cell in the pmo. besides, he wanted a special meeting of the nda to be convened on the ayodhya issue to evolve a ""minimum consensus"" in the matter. referring to the government stand that resolution of the ayodhya dispute should be left to the courts, he sought to know as to how courts were quick to dispose of the case involving aiadmk supremo jayalalitha but had taken ten years so far on the ayodhya case. noting that ayodhya dispute was much serious a matter than jayalalitha''s court case, he wanted vajpayee to make a public appeal to the supreme court to give its verdict on the ayodhya matter within three months.

"ahmedabad: the traditional trouble spots of disturbances in the walled city of ahmedabad are surprisingly quiet as the fringes of the city are emerging as the new communal hot-spots. it is remarkable, police officials say, that thickly-populated areas like kalupur, dariapur, jamalpur and raipur and khadia have remained relatively trouble-free this time accounting for only six out of a over 300 deaths that have taken place in ahmedabad over the last four days. the bulk of the killings have taken place in meghaninagar, naroda, odhav, amraiwadi and gomtipur. and the reasons are not far to seek. while the communally volatile walled city areas have sizeable population of both communities sharing space, there is also mutual respect for each othersaEUR(tm) strengths as compared to other areas. surprisingly, even as pitched battles were going on in fringe areas of gomtipur and naroda, the womenfolk were busy buying vegetables and fruits in manekchowk in the hub of the city. for the first time perhaps in the history of communal flare-ups of ahmedabad, it is not the walled city areas which are in the news for all the wrong reasons. officials say it could also be aEUR~riot fatigueaEUR(tm) as the residents of the walled city have suffered the worst consequences of riots and therefore they have preferred to remain away from perpetuation of violence. when commissioner of police p c pandey was asked for his reaction on the phenomenon, he quipped, ""thank god that walled city remained quiet this timeaEUR. he admitted the fact that the situation would have taken a serious turn had trouble sparked off inside the walled city. in 1969, 1983, 1985 and 1992 the focus of the attention were kalupur, dariapur, jamalpur and the worst hit raipur and khadia which have earned dubious distinction for violence since british period. the bouts of communal orgy in ahmedabad has its roots in the rath yatra taken out from famous jagdish temple located in jamalpur area of the walled city. the first major disturbance was reported in 1946 when ugly clashes were reported between two communities during the rath yatra. according to sources, the riots in large scale started only after tiffs over annual rath yatra procession, except in 1992 when trouble erupted after the demolition of the babri mosque. it is for the second time perhaps that riots have been triggered off on a massive scale during the vhp sponsored gujarat bandh to protest against the killing of ram sevaks aboard sabarmati express, who were returning from ayodhya. unfortunately, despite frequent riots the state administration has not bothered to implement the recommendations made by two inquiry commissions, one appointed after the 1969 riots and the second after the 1985 riots. the report submitted by the reddy commission and the dave commission have been shelved and none of the findings and suggestions made by the commissions have been accepted or implemented so far. aEURoeneither congress or bjp regime have taken pains to study the recommendations made by these commissions to check the communal disturbances in ahmedabad,aEUR a senior minister confirmed on condition of annynomity.

"lucknow: in a significant move, the centre on wednesday approached the allahabad high court seeking a day-to-day hearing of the case relating to the ayodhya dispute.        read this story in...          A A hindi    a petition was filed by the centre before the lucknow bench of the high court comprising justice sudhir narayan, justice rafat alam and justice bhanwar singh praying for a direction that the hearing of the case relating to the dispute be taken up on a day-to-day basis. the court granted time till march 18 to the parties for filing replies to the application while posting further hearing on it to march 19. the application filed before the full bench through additional solicitor general r n trivedi comes in the midst of fresh intiatives taken by the centre to resolve the ram janmabhoomi-babri masjid dispute, especially a day after the kanchi shankaracharya floated a formula for breaking the deadlock. trivedi impressed on the court that under the acquisition act of 1993, the union of india was statutory receiver with the obligation to maintain status quo till the disposal of the suits. it was spending about rs 30 crore annually in this regard, he added. it was submitted that in view of the sensitive issues involved, it would be appropriate if the disputes were resolved as early as possible. the additional solicitor general said so far the testimony of 23 witnesses have been completed. the examination and cross-examination of witnesses sometimes took 12-15 days. zafaryab jilani, appearing for sunni wakf board, objected to the maintainability of the application on the ground that the centre was never a party to the dispute. a manan, appearing for one of the plaintiffs, also wanted to file objections to the centre''s application. r l verma, appearing for one of the parties to the suit also sought time to file reply to the application. trivedi responded that in the dispute between the parties, the union of india was not a necessary party but in its capacity as the statutory receiver it could not be said that the centre had no locus standi to file an application for early hearing. the high court had in 1989 directed that four title suits originally filed before the civil judge, faizabad, be transferred to its lucknow bench for original trial of the case relating to the ownership of the disputed area at ayodhya. all the four suits were now pending before a special full bench of the high court. after the demolition of the disputed structure in ayodhya in 1992, the disputed area and the adjacent area was acquired by the centre under the provisions of the acquisition of certain area at ayodhya act (accaaa), 1993. the validity of this act was challenged in supreme court in 1994, which had upheld the constitutional validity of the acaaa. under section 7 of the act, faizabad divisional commissioner is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining status quo in the disputed area till the transfer of property is made by the centre on resolution of the dispute to the party found entitled to it in accordance of the final adjudication of the issue by the court. the four title suits for the determination of the true owner of the disputed area were being heard by the court and till its adjudication the centre as the statutory receiver has to maintain status quo, trivedi said. the centre said as statutory receiver it was administering the property in a befitting manner considering the sensitivity of the issue, the threat perception to the makeshift structure and the volatile law and order situation, which was often fuelled and worsened by religious passions. this has necessitated flow and utilisation of huge manpower and financial resources to maintain status quo and law and order in the area and pointed out that government was spending rs 30 crore on the maintenance and security of the area alone, trivedi said. the application also said the centre was holding and managing the additional land measuring 70 acres adjacent to the disputed area to implement the final verdict of the high court. ""in view of the nature of the issues involved, their importance and sensitivity and consideration of national interest, which impelled early resolution of the dispute on an urgent basis, the central government is vitally interested that the suits be decided at an early date,"" it said. related stories:A kanchi seer postpones return homeA kanchi seer offers new peace formula for templeA land cannot be given to vhp    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	1	0	0

"This story is from March 5, 2002  ahmedabad: the bjp-ruled gujarat government is in no mood to extend the terms of reference of the proposed judicial inquiry commission into the godhra train massacre to its bloody aftermath all over the state. a clear message to this effect had come from union home minister l k advani in ahmedabad on sunday when he said that ""these two are separate matters, they should not be linked together"". chief minister narendra modi, who had announced a judicial inquiry into the sabarmati express massacre in godhra on wednesday last, is said to be looking for a retired or sitting gujarat high court judge to probe the matter, but it has been made clear to the prospective candidates that the riots in ahmedabad and the rest of gujarat would not be a subject of their investigation. at least one of the judges approached by modi is understood to have asked the chief minister clearly whether the riots after the godhra incident would also be covered by the inquiry commission. the reply was in the negative. sources said that at least three judges, including a sitting judge of gujarat hc and a former acting chief justice of bombay hc had been approached for the probe and the announcement is likely to be made later this week. sources said that while the godhra incident was being investigated by police and other agencies to look at the aspect of whether it was pre-meditated, there was a need for a thorough probe into the bloody aftermath. aspects like the bjp''s support to the vhp''s bandh call on thursday, the soft approach towards the rioters on the first two days and the slugging reaction of the entire administration were best probed by the judiciary. especially when the city police has actually named some of the bjp and vhp activists in their first information reports (firs) in some of the big carnages that took place in ahmedabad. and that''s precisely why the modi government does not want an all-encompassing judicial probe to open a can of worms which will explode in its face. however, the judicial intervention is likely sooner than later in the form of public interest litigations which may also call for a full-scale probe."	0	0	1	0	0
This story is from March 11, 2002  surat: nearly 35 per cent children of the country are deprived of education as they have no access to it. if education and health sectors are taken care, the country can generate employment opportunities to them, said rajmohan gandhi here recently. he was speaking at the southern gujarat chamber of commerce and industry (sgcci) on the impact of globalisation on the indian economy. elaborating on the importance of education and health in india, gandhi said that though there is a lot of political talk going on about these two sectors, there is very little that is actually taking place. he stressed on the need to provide employment to the masses. this could be done if adequate emphasis was placed on developing the health and education sectors, he asserted. he said that each and every wealthy citizen must pay his tax. this will enable the government to provide adequate infrastructure in the areas of health and education. on the issue of globalisation, the grandson of mahatma gandhi said that competition is healthy but only as long as india is able to face it. meanwhile, at a separate event speaking at a lecture series as part of the birth centenary of loknayak jayprakash narayan at gandhi smriti bhavan here in nanpura, gandhi spoke about the contribution of jayprakash narayan to the freedom struggle. he also spoke at length on mahatma gandhi''s contribution to the freedom struggle and the role of the british government. dwelling on the ''divide and rule'' policy adopted by the british, he said that it is wrongly perceived that gandhiji was responsible for partition of hindustan into india and pakistan. he said that though muslims and hindus had lived together for many years, their relations were never very good. drawing from history, he said that the seeds of partition were sown way back during 1924-1937 when various leaders, including veer savarkar, kavi iqbal and lala lajpat rai, spoke about separate hindu and muslim states. he further said that though gandhiji can be blamed to a certain extent, the british policy of ''divide and rule'' and mohammed ali jinnah''s insistence for a separate state also played a pivotal role in the partition. striving to negate feelings that it was gandhiji who was responsible for mixing religion with politics, he said that religion had entered politics much before. he said that swaraj, ahimsa and satyagrah were concepts that were very close to gandhiji.	0	0	0	0	0

""we have not taken any decision. if the proposal comes, the dharmacharyas will decide on it, "" he said. he, however, did reiterate that ""we have said we will not go to the disputed area for now"", adding that the allahabad high court must take a decision in the pending case on the basis of documentary evidence furnished by the vhp and not witnesses. the shankaracharya further stressed that the ram idol would remain virajman at the sanctum sanctorum and the daily puja would continue in the pendency of the title suit. in short, if construction begins on the adjacent acquired land, then there will be no way that the area can ever be restored to the muslims, even if the title suit is decided in their favour eventually, since the construction that will begin will follow the master plan which envisages the disputed spot as the sanctum sanctorum. kishore, meanwhile, ruled out compromise on the three demands made on monday: that all restrictions enforced in ayodhya be lifted, shifting of carved stones to the undisputed site be allowed and the undisputed land be handed over to it before june 2 for construction to begin. on any other issue, he said, ""we have an open mind"". the vhp leader confirmed that both the kanchi shankaracharya and the rss were mediating between the parishad and the government on handing over the undisputed land to them for construction, and hoped the issue would be solved through mediation. any solution, however, had to come by march 12 and the government would have to begin removing hurdles in the way of temple construction, he said. regardless of the government''s stand, he said, material for construction would begin to be moved to the undisputed land at 2.15 pm on march 15, and construction would begin at the site of the shila pujan on any mahurat before june 2, when the 108-day yajna ended. kishore ""appealed"" that the only way communal tension on the issue could be eased was by the ""muslims showing large-heartedness and giving up their claim on the ram janmabhoomi. this will help hindu-muslim unity."" insisting there were no decisions yet from the meetings that the shankaracharya had held, kishore said the kanchi seer was engaged in ensuring that the government hand over the undisputed land to the trust for construction to begin. the shankaracharya too said there was no legal hurdle in the way of the government accepting the demand. the government on its part, was in the process of consulting its nda allies, he said. the ram janmabhoomi trust, he said, had given him a written undertaking that no activity would be undertaken on the disputed site. on the government''s part, he said, the prime minister would consider all issues and put the centre''s stand before parliament. ""everything will be done before march 15,"" he said. he stressed that ""status quo will be maintained at the disputed site"" and that construction on the undisputed land would not hamper entry into the disputed site. the religious leader also held meetings with representatives of the muslim personal law board and other muslim leaders. board spokesman kamaal farooqi said the seer had made a proposal for a solution which would combine ""both dialogue and a court settlement"", refusing to divulge further details. the board, farooqi said, had neither accepted nor rejected the proposal yet and would deliberate on it on march 9, after which its decision would be communicated to the shankaracharya. political observers say a compromise seems imminent and the vhp''s hard line is a last-ditch face-saving effort before it gives in on some of its demands. the shankaracharya, who had once met prime minister atal bihari vajpayee on monday night, met the latter again late on tuesday to discuss the issue. there was no official briefing on the meeting. related stories A muslim board agrees to consider vhp proposalA hand over ayodhya land by june 2: vhpA kar sevaks violate prohibitory orders again    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0
"gandhinagar: ex-mp of congress, ehsan jafri, who was burnt alive on february 28 between 3.30 p.m. and 4.30 p.m., along with tens of others in gulmarg society in naroda, ahmedabad, was a victim of official and political indifference, alleges his widow. ""he made more than 200 frantic calls to police, bureaucrats and politicians whom he knew so well. he banked upon them to save the life of 90 to 100 persons gathered at our residence from the neighbourhood thinking they would be safe with us. but no one helped,"" recalls his widow zakia nasim jafri, who is now staying with her relatives. zakia, in her late 60s, considers her husband as the ""epitome of secularism, for he visualised the gulmarg society for muslims immediately after the 1969 communal riots in the predominantly hindu neighbourhood."" recalling the tragic afternoon of february 28, she says, ""it was a huge crown of hooligans. i do not want to blame my hindu neighbours. possibly, they were afraid of facing the wrath of the miscreants"". ""we lived in the gandhi chawl, also situated in the naroda area, in 1969. our house was burnt then also. he survived the riots, walked out in his simple khadi clothes,"" she candidly said. having just observed the last rites of her husband on monday evening, zakia, a housewife is obviously shaken. ""he told us, we would not move elsewhere. he had great faith in our hindu neighbours. he said he would like to live only among those with whom he had lived and worked as political and social worker. they were all his friends and loved him. he trusted them. he built the gulmarg society having 19 bungalows and 8 flats."" despite the fact that she had to tread through the burnt corpses of tens of those killed in the arson before being taken out by a handful of courageous youth, zakia said, ""i would like to go back and live there again, reviving his dream of harmony. i trust my hindu neighbours. none among them had participated in the arson"", she said. ""i am sure the government will help us build our society in the memory of ehsan jafri and make it a symbol of secularism. i want hindus and muslims to live together."" till monday late evening, when this correspondent met her, no congress or bjp leader had come to express grief about the tragedy. ""i received telephone calls from congress leader amarsinh chaudhary and rajya sabha chairperson najma heptullah sharing their sorrow"", she said. elected congress mp from ahmedabad in 1977, soon after the emergency, ehsan jafri was ""professionally a lawyer but had the heart of a poet"", his widow zakia said. a friend of towering urdu poets, some living, others dead, including sardar jafri, majruh sultanpuri and javed ansari, he had published two collections of his 100-odd poems, most of them on love and communal harmony. ""there are some unpublished verses, too, including those that were burnt in the 1969 riots"", zakia said. showing one of the urdu collections, kandil(lamp), a relative of jafri read out a verse which said, ""if you are a good messiah, why don''t you reveal what you are? why don''t you put off the candle that fails to provide light?"" another verse on communal violence, written in 1996, as if a premonition of what was to come six years later, read, ""neither the apostle nor the alexander came out. only daggers sprouted on busy streets. everyone said they were messiahs. but when they knocked, they were found to be tormentors. human corpses decomposed on the streets. even the crows seemed to live better than man."" with kandil in her hands, zakia said, ""those who attacked us and our neighbours must be punished by law. i am sure, justice would come one day."" zakia denied her husband had fired shots from a private gun provoking mob attack, as alleged by some. a witness to the tragic event, she does not betray feelings of despair. ""it is not part of our indian culture and tradition to perpetrate violence. we live in the land of the mahatma. my husband believed and practised in non-violence. why this bloodshed? i appeal to both hindus and muslims to begin a new life by starting to live together again. that alone will redeem my husband''s dream."" related storiesA doubts over isi hand in train attackA debate over victims'' compensationA gujarat inching towards normalcyA sonia to visit ahmedabad on march 8A pray for peace in gujaratA gujarat riots: the story so farA A A full coverage    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	1	0

"ayodhya: chanting hymns, kar sevaks on tuesday took out a march from one camp to another in the holy city, violating prohibitory orders for the second day running. carrying banners and raising slogans, nearly 300 kar sevaks, mostly women, took out the march from kar sevak puram to ram sevak puram covering a distance of one-km. when police tried to persuade them not to take out the march, they moved in batches of four but regrouped after some distance. about 100 kar sevaks took out a procession on monday defying prohibitory orders. a senior official, when asked to comment on the violation, told pti ""it was a peaceful procession, if we call it a procession at all."" ""nobody has violated the law as there is absolute peace. administration will not unnecessarily provoke them,"" he said. authorities had put up public notices outside kar sevak puram and ram sevak puram on saturday warning against organising rallies or taking out processions. interestingly, the notices were not seen yesterday and were apparently removed. meanwhile, police today started house-to-house survey to check authenticity of genuine residents. checking and patrolling at city''s border was intensified to prevent kar sevaks from entering ayodhya. police sources said at least 65 companies of crpf had either been deployed or were on stand-by to meet any eventuality. they would supplement 17 companies of provincial armed constabulary (pac) and the state police, the sources said. they said so far 2500 kar sevaks had been ""transported"" out by the state administration since the suspension of train services. as authorities claimed that no fresh batch of kar sevaks had reached ayodhya since saturday, vhp sources said they continued to arrive in small numbers.

"ahmedabad: the communal disturbances that rocked the city for one week has caused heavy losses of around rs 300 crore to the production and sale of fabrics manufactured in 18 textile mills and over 200 process houses and powerloom units - a majority of them still closed as fear stricken workers have left for their native places. according to a rough survey made by the ahmedabad textile mills association and the textile labour association the representative union over 1,00,000 workers employed in these units have suffered loss of wages totalling to around rs 10 crore due to the disturbances in last few days, the tla general secretary manhar shukla said. shukla, who has witnessed the worst 1969 communal riots in the city, told tnn: ""it was horrible this time because several innocent people were burnt alive by the miscreants and the labourers were the adversly affected as usual."" while recalling his trumatic experiences of 1969 the veteran gandhian trade unionist said, ""even in 1969 the labour areas of gomtipur and amraiwadi and rajpur-hirpur bore the brunt of communal orgy and the representatives of the majoor mahajan sangh had moved alongwith army personnel in the affected areas and helped restore peace and order."" he lamented that around 25 textile mills had closed down following textile crisis in eighties and now only 18 of them were functioned and out of that some units of the national textile corporation were on the verge of closure and therefore the losses to the production and wages were less as compared to that of rs 30 crore in 1969. excepting big textile units like that of arvind and ashima all other mills had to keep their shutters down as workers did not report for duty for six to seven days. even on wednesday only 30 per cent of the labourers had reached the mills. the mills he said had remained closed for 3 months following a call for ''hartal'' given by mahatma gandhi demanding more wages for the workers in forties which was considered a golden period for textile mills of ahmedabad. after that the mills had to remain closed for few days during maha gujarat movement and later on in 1973`s navnirman agitation and 1985 communal riots and also in 1992 in the wake of demolition of babri mosque. the atma and tla have issued a joint appeal for restoration of peace and have also sent a letter to the state government regarding problems of the textile mills, he added. after so many years the offices of the gandhian trade union had to remain closed following curfew in the walled city areas.

This story is from March 7, 2002  mumbai: stevedoring in mumbai has almost come to an end with just ten firms still holding licences while the others have surrendered their right to supervise loading and unloading of vessels because it has become unremunerative.  stevedoring firms supervise loading and unloading of cargo in vessels. for over 200 years, they formed the backbone of the ports and shipping industry because they could delay loading and unloading of vessels, forcing a ship owner into penury. ship owners would lose crores of rupees within weeks because the ship had to continue to remain berthed with wharfage, cranage and other costs going up.  but from earning crores of rupees each month, today these stevedores collectively owe the mumbai port trust (mbpt) about rs 20 crore by way of workers'' wages which they are unable to pay because their earnings have dipped with the falling container traffic in this port, according to mbpt sources.  twenty-one firms were once members of the bombay stevedores association (bsa) which was set up in september 1953. but after the jawaharlal nehru port trust (jnpt) was set up on may 1, 1989, huge container vessels had to go there because the centuries-old mbpt did not have enough water depth to allow huge container vessels to berth.  so from handling 600,000 containers each year, the mbpt container traffic dwindled to just about 250,000 containers per year while the occupancy rate of its 24 berths also fell to less than 50 per cent, according to bsa president resham singh.  each stevedoring firm had to fork out about rs 12 lakhs per month because they had to pay the workers their wages. the union insisted on the stevedores using the surplus labour in the mbpt consisting of eight persons per gang although the firms had no money to pay them. also, global shipping lines such as maersk preferred to use ports such as kandla or even the minor ports such as pipav, dahej and porbandar in gujarat, where the cost of loading and unloading was much cheaper.  the indiscriminate allotment of licences by the mbpt to combat the monopoly of the stevedores who earlier did not allow new entrants into their cartel also speeded up the death of the industry. the stevedores challenged this in the bombay high court where they lost. they went to the supreme court which observed that it was left to the chairman of the mbpt to use his discretion.	0	0	0	0	0
ayodhya: the continuing administrative squeeze around ayodhya and faizabad got tighter on saturday, with the cancellation or diversion of all trains reaching the twin towns till further notice.the last of the trains, carrying some 2,000 karsevaks from ayodhya, left town on friday evening. ironically enough, it was the sabarmati express, bound for ahmedabad in gujarat, the same ill-fated train which was attacked in godhra last wednesday.the lack of easy transportation to and from ayodhya has already begun to reflect in the numbers at karsevakpuram, the vhp headquarters in ayodhya. just before noon, the site of the purna ahuti yagna conducted every morning since february 24 looks deserted but for a dozen or so karsevaks. ``we have strict instructions not to let the media in,'''' says the young volunteer in-charge of regulating the negligible human traffic to the holy fire.local media in-charge of the vhp sharad sharma at first sullenly denied that the number of karsevaks had dwindled. then he said since the trains were stopped on friday, some 2,000 karsevaks arrived on saturday by other means. the local bjp leaders, re-elected mla lallu singh and the faizabad district party president mahant manmohan das, are more forthright. because of the administration''s dictatorial ban on rail and road travel, religious-minded karsevaks are being prevented from reaching ayodhya, they complain.there are no exact estimates of how many karsevaks are still left behind in ayodhya. the figure varies from an optimistic 4,000 to an improbable 10,000.requests to visit ramsevakpuram ^ the semi-permanent township which houses the vhp volunteers ^ for an independent assessment, are firmly turned down. ``the karsevaks have told us not to send anyone from the media there...because the media can some times be too aggressive with its questioning,'''' says sharma.that might be so, but he clearly has other things on his mind. on friday evening, a wire service photographer was manhandled inside ramsevakpuram and his chain snatched.just a stone''s throw away from karsevakpuram, the administration has, in the past 24 hours, part-sealed the workshop where stone pillars for the proposed temple are being chiseled and carved. the gate used for bulk transportation has been locked up, with a single-file side entrance allowed for individual access. the men in uniform posted outside have orders not to let anyone unlock the main gate.but none of this is having a reassuring impact in the muslim areas of the temple town. from kutia to panjitola, kajiara to begumpura, the mood among the minorities remains grimly nervous. many families have moved their women and young ones to safer areas. but it is impossible to ascertain how many. mohammed salim, nephew of hashim ansari, the man who filed the original court petition against the installation of ram idols in 1949, claims that nearly every muslim family in panjitola located within shouting distance of the barbed-wire fencing that marks off the acquired land around the disputed masjid has seen some safety-driven migration.but in faizabad, khalil ahmed khan, of the faizabad helal committee, has compiled a list complete as of friday of those muslim families who have left ayodhya for safer destinations. while khan feels that the administration has clearer directions today than in december 1992 ^ both from the court and the central government to maintain the peace and the status quo, there is ample room for concern.but the last word belongs to a retired muslim teacher: if the muslims are migrating, can anyone blame them? do you think a muslim can really trust the system after what has happened in gujarat in the last two days?

"by rakesh bhatnagar new delhi: ""would the government allow any organisation to perform puja in the rashtrapati bhawan?"" was the supreme court's tart query to attorney general soli j sorabjee when he said that the vishwa hindu parishad could be allowed to perform bhoomi pujan on the acquired land in ayodhya on march 15. ""the rashtrapati bhawan belongs to you, so is the acquired land,"" justice g b pattanaik said with a view to stress the fact that once status quo was ordered and the government was made the absolute owner of the acquired land, nothing temporary or symbolic could be allowed on it. ""this is not rashtrapati bhawan,"" sorabjee replied back and continued to offer the centre's stand on the proposed bhoomi pujan. at the outset, three senior most judges - justice b n kirpal, justice g b pattanaik and justice v n khare who will become chief justice in 2002 - asked the centre if it stood by the undertaking given to the court earlier. the bench was referring to demolition of babri mosque in 1992 despite an undertaking given by the centre and the up government that it would be protected at all costs. when sorabjee replied, ""the object is not to rake up the past"", the bench shot back: ""we cannot forget the past. we do not want to repeat the past"", referring the vhp's promise broken on december 6, 1992. sorabjee explained that the centre sought to give this concession (allowing bhoomi pujan) because of strong emotions expressed by the majority community. the court was not impressed. ""if you (centre) allow puja today, will you allow 'namaz' there tomorrow?"" the court asked. equally sharp were the court's queries over the legal status of the vhp, respondent in bhure's petition. ""what is vhp? is it a trust or a society under the societies act and is it registered?"" the judges asked vhp's counsel rama jois, former chief justice of the karnataka and punjab and haryana high courts. counsel was not sure about it. he said it was not the vhp but ram janmabhoomi nyas that had sought permission to perform the puja. later, jois said the vhp was a registered body, but he could not inform the court about its aims and objects. he said all the trustees of 'nyas' who started the movement 40 years ago are over 75 years of age and they want to ""breathe their last"" after performing a small bhoomi pujan for lord ram's temple. when jois pleaded for permission to perform the puja, the bench said it might escalate the situation. but jois said by not allowing the puja, the court might escalate the situation as lakhs of people wanted a temple in ayodhya. ""but lakhs also do not want construction of the temple"", the bench retorted. as jois said eight years had elapsed since the suits over ownership of the acquired land were reopened but only 23 witnesses had been examined, the bench said it was because of the litigating parties that the hearings had been adjourned. ""somebody wants to keep the pot boiling,"" justice kirpal summed up. related stories  Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0

lucknow: with samajwadi partyaEUR(tm)s mulayam singh yadav staking his claim to form the next government in up, and his immediate rivals, the bjp and the bsp, bowing out of the race for the time being, governor vishnukant shastri seems to have been left with no excuse to avoid taking a decision. he has two options before him: seek imposition of presidentaEUR(tm)s rule or give mulayam a chance. and he has to take a decision soon. in fact, shastri began the process by meeting bjp leader and outgoing chief minister rajnath singh on thursday. rajanth reiterated his partyaEUR(tm)s decision to sit in the opposition and handed over a letter to this effect to the governor. interestingly, rajnath denied any possibility of a bjp-bsp alliance at this juncture by saying: aEUR~aEUR~it is time for the holi festivities and not raksha bandhan, which is six months away.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) the bsp too has apprised the governor about its decision not to support any political party in government formation. a letter to this effect was handed over to the governor on thursday on behalf of mayawati, who is away in delhi along with her party mlas. parrying queries, shastri said: aEUR~aEUR~i am keen to take a quick decision.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) but for this, he said he would have to talk to leaders of all political parties and seek their views in writing. aEUR~aEUR~the process has begun with a meeting with rajnath,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he said, adding that after completing this exercise, another round of talks would be held with mulayam before taking a final decision on government formation. although the term of the current assembly will expire on march 26, the governor seems to be under compulsion to hasten his decision. it is mainly because of the bjpaEUR(tm)s predicament, which stands a chance of getting isolated from its nda partners at the centre in the wake of a possible confrontation with the vhp on ayodhya. this is coupled with the administrative mess in up due to the absence of any government at present. any delay on the part of the governor may spell doom for an already anaemic bjp in up. but either way, the governoraEUR(tm)s delay cannot bail out the bjp. if mulayam is given a chance, he may form the government, but if the state is put under presidentaEUR(tm)s rule, then the governor will himself rake up the same controversy that engulfed his predecessor, romesh bhandari.

new delhi: secularism, a basic feature of the constitution, guarantees right to life and liberty to every citizen. as this tenet professes respect for every religion, the state is under a constitutional obligation to protect the life and property of anyone, irrespective of his caste, colour or creed.  therefore, failure in carrying out this duty may be construed as failure of the constitutional machinery in a given state, irrespective of the ruling party''s political philosophy. in other words, the philosophy must be in line with the preamble of the constitution.  the applicability of the principle comes into focus in the backdrop of communal backlash in gujarat. deaths due to communal violence are on the rise. whether the state was caught unawares or failed to act in time can only be decided through a time-consuming exercise called the judicial commission under the commissions of inquiry act.  the eventual fate of the commission''s findings is anybody''s guess, considering that the findings of several fact-finding commissions set up by the centre or any state remain only on paper. so, no wonder if the panel''s findings on the gujarat mayhem may meet the same fate as that of the sri krishna commission report on the mumbai riots. the indicted government had ``rubbished'''' the report while its successor is still scrutinising the report to take action against the guilty.  lawyers such as r k jain, v n saraf and a former attorney general said that the commissions of inquiry act must be amended, making it mandatory to take action on the findings of a commission. ``otherwise, the commissions will remain a farce,'''' said jain. saraf too regretted: ``the findings adorn the heavily dusted shelves of the government.''''  the former attorney general, too, said ``the commissions are set up as an alibi by the government''''.  commenting on the riots, in a rare judgment, the apex court has observed ``the leaders and the society have not played their part to teach them (rioters) that religions are not meant for killing fellow human beings. if ignorance had prompted people to take cudgels in the name of religion for indulging in carnage or murders, they are no doubt liable to be convicted and sentenced for the offence committed by them.''''

This story is from March 6, 2002  pune: the two-day state level seminar on ''the challenge of terrorism in the 21st century'', which began at the st. mira''s college for girls here on tuesday, was particularly apt in the light of events in gujarat in the past week, as most speakers emphasised the multidimensional nature of terrorism. the conference, sponsored by the university grants commission (ugc), has been organised to find out meaningful ways to combat terrorism in the backdrop of heightened tension, particularly after the godhra incident, as dr g.h. gidwani, principal of the college, said. social activist and former union minister mohan dharia, who chaired the inaugural session said terrorism in its present context threatens the very survival and existence of mankind. tha panel of speakers in the second session included editor in chief of lokmat group, kumar ketkar, sandeep pendse of the vikas adhyayan kendra, mumbai and dr nirmala pandit. each one of them talked of the theoretical and conceptual issues in the analysis of terrorism. they tried to arrive at a definition of terrorism and discussed whether the justifications sometimes put forward for such acts were valid. all agreed that given the weapons now in the hands of terrorists, the threat to human survival from such acts of terror were far greater than at any time before. weak or unjust states and those that suppressed dissent were more likely to breed terrorist movements and hence the need for just governance. a post-lunch session was to address such issues as war and terorism, women and terrorism, economic imperialism and terrorism, cultural terrorism and liberation movements, struggles for autonomy and terrorism.	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 7, 2002  mumbai: the all-india christian council (aicc) has called for an international ban on the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) and the bajrang dal. it has also decided to move the united nations high commissioner on human rights and other international forums to investigate the activities and the funding sources of these organisations in the western countries as well as in west asia, japan and mauritius.  aicc secretary-general john dayal condemned the violence and destruction caused by religious extremists in gujarat and said a ban on these fundamentalist organisations in india was not enough as their evil ideology had found supporters in other parts of the world as well. ``the indian government banned the students islamic movement of india (simi), however it has taken no action against these hindu extremists despite overwhelming evidence of complicity in violence against christians and muslims,'''' he said.  according to him, these organisations have engaged in constant hate campaigns against the minorities and have also recruited thousands of people for arms training. he cited the march 2 incidents of violence against christian missionaries in gujarat as a part of these campaigns. he stated that huge funds were used for these campaigns. ``the vhp''s devious campaign to gain respectability in the un and other forums have been fully exposed by its present actions and statements,'''' he said.  the council has also called upon the supreme court and the national human rights commission to investigate the government and police complicity in the communal carnage. mr dayal condemned the gujarat government and said it had made the state the laboratory for hindutva experiment. he said the council had on many other occasions pointed out that the police and bureaucracy in the state had been infiltrated by the hindutva ideology which traced its roots to hitler''s nazism, but to no avail.  ``india''s name has been defamed because of the recent incidents and only a ban on these organisations can rebuild national credibility,'''' he said.	0	0	1	0	0

A A hindi    singhal said he had, in his capacity of managing trustee of the ram janmabhoomi nyas, communicated this stand in a written petition to prime minister atal bihari vajpayee on february 27 and had clarified the position on thursday in response to a query from the prime minister''s office. singhal said: ""this submission makes it clear that we will maintain status quo on the disputed land and accept the judgment of the court of law."" the statement said he had accepted that ""whichever party wins in the court of law, it will be given the disputed place and the necessary amount of adjacent land for use."" in saying so, singhal contradicted senior parishad leader acharya giriraj kishore''s categorical assertion on wednesday that no such commitment had been made by the vhp. stating that kishore, as a member of the nyas, had been in the know of the commitment made to the prime minister, singhal ""withdrew"" the acharya''s remark. a much-mellowed vhp president said the plan to shift carved stones to the undisputed land and the shila pujan remained unchanged, but he was at pains to explain that puja would be performed not for carved pillars but stones, which was a ritual. the puja, he said, ""would be performed in a peaceful, cheerful, joyous and blessed atmosphere."" he also welcomed the centre''s move to urge the allahabad high court to hold daily hearing on the ram temple issue, noting that with the lucknow bench accepting the petition, ""it may be hoped that this case can be adjudicated and resolved within a period of one year."" taking apart most of kishore''s statements, singhal said the vhp was willing to abandon its plan for a sanctum sanctorum on the disputed land and would even allow rebuilding of a mosque if the court verdict went against the ramjanmabhoomi trust. he dismissed earlier statements that no mosque would be allowed within ayodhya as the ""view of the ayodhya sants."" considerably toning down the hitherto aggressive stance, singhal also said the vhp was not demanding immediate transfer of the undisputed land, only permission for the march 15 programme and an eventual transfer before the 100-day yajna ended on june 2. he, however, objected to the involvement of the all-india muslim personal law board in this matter, saying ""there is no role for any third party so far as the 43-acre area of the undisputed/acquired land is concerned. he requested the government to remove the restrictions on the entry of kar sevaks coming to ayodhya and the restrictions imposed within the temple town saying these had caused untold hardships and were stalling an essentially peaceful religious programme. ""we want the situation restored to as it was on february 25,"" singhal said. the restrictions were imposed after the godhra incident on february 26. related stories A vhp will not be part of ayodhya talksA govt monitoring movement of kar sevaksA give demand in writing: babri panel    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 13, 2002  mumbai: the nation is eagerly awaiting the supreme court verdict on wednesday when it is expected to pronounce whether or not the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) and other hindutva organisations would be allowed to do the controversial bhoomi pujan at the disputed site in ayodhya. the all india muslim personal law board (aimplb), which has emerged as the principal negotiator with the government on the ayodhya issue, has declared that it will abide by the courtaEUR(tm)s order. however, the vhp has refrained from issuing any such statement. in this context, this newspaper spoke to islamic scholar asghar ali engineer. excerpts: do you agree with the aimplbaEUR(tm)s assurance regarding the courtaEUR(tm)s order? although i support this stand, i am concerned how such an assurance was given when the vhp refused to commit anything. even today, the vhp refuses to say that it will honour the apex courtaEUR(tm)s order on the issue of aEUR~bhoomi pujanaEUR(tm) on march 15. in the absence of a clear commitment by the vhp, how do you react to the communally charged situation today, specially in the backdrop of godhra? the vhp is whipping up communal passions in the country. kar sevaks are reaching ayodhya though prohibitory orders have been issued there. the centre still does not seem to be taking enough steps to check the entry of kar sevaks into ayodhya. itaEUR(tm)s time the supreme court took suo motu notice of the prevailing situation and issued specific directions to the centre. but prime minister a.b. vajpayee says he has been consulting muslim leadership for a long time now. the same mr vajpayee has not even bothered to constitute the national integration council ever since the government came to power. even mohalla committees meet in such times; here the nic has not even been set up when the nation is being put to a communal test once again. you had initially opposed the role of the aimplb as a negotiator in the ayodhya dispute. please comment. it was not my personal opinion. it was decided by a group of prominent secular citizens that any negotiations on the ayodhya issue should be held with the government and not with the vhp, to which the aimplb agreed. besides, it is not an elected body representing muslims. like the aimplb, the vhp also is not an elected body of the hindus, but it is spearheading the temple movement.how does one assess the feelings of a common hindu or a muslim? the bjp came to power on the ram temple issue. however, in the recent assembly elections in uttar pradesh, the same issue could not get them enough seats. in fact, the ayodhya issue today seems to be threatening the bjpled government at the centre. this should be some indication of the feelings of the majority community to the temple issue now. but do you feel the common muslim is against the construction of the ram temple at the disputed site? i donaEUR(tm)t think so. had that been the case, the aimplb, which has representatives even from the babri masjid action committee and the babri masjid action coordination committee would not have agreed to abide by the supreme courtaEUR(tm)s orders. after all, if the court rules in favour of a temple, it will have to be built on the disputed site. do you think we are nearing a solution to the ayodhya controversy? i am not sure.the vhp has always gone back on its promise. muslims as a community cannot trust it. muslims do not trust the bjp-led government either, but since they are in power, one has to take their word. but the vhp should give written assurance to the court that it will not rake up the issues of kashi or mathura. the bjp as a party has always blamed the lack of leadership and direction among the countryaEUR(tm)s muslims for not allowing the community to enter the national mainstream. the only grievance of muslims is that whichever party they thought was secular merely used them as a vote-bank. only six per cent of our mps belong to the muslim community. the representation in the assemblies is even lower. muslims are not allowed to become leaders in major political parties.the moment they form a political party, they are branded as communal.  	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 5, 2002  hyderabad: the nine left-wing parties in the state have demanded that an inquiry be conducted by a sitting supreme court judge into the incidents at godhra where the sabarmati express was burnt and the subsequent communal carnage in gujarat. the parties, including cpm and cpi, which had earlier called for a statewide bandh on march 6, has now postponed it by a day due to the death of lok sabha speaker g m c balayogi. in a memorandum submitted to governor dr c rangarajan on monday, the parties condemned the attack on sabarmati express at godhra in which 60 were burnt alive and described the act as inhuman. they also demanded action against fundamentalist hindu organisations, which, according to them, were bent upon vitiating the communal harmony in the country by mobilising forces for construction of the ram temple at ayodhya. the memorandum also condemned gujarat chief minister narendra modiaEUR(tm)s provocative statements and said that it had aggravated the situation. the parties also urged the union government to initiate all necessary steps to maintain law and order and demanded compensation for riot victims.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 14, 2002  hyderabad: majlis-e-ittehadul muslimeen legislators walked out of the assembly on wednesday protesting the denial of permission to speak on the ayodhya issue. the proceedings of the house were stalled for more than an hour soon after the assembly commenced its business on wednesday, with mim floor leader asaduddin owaisi seeking to move an adjournment motion to discuss the ayodhya issue and the failure of the state government in taking any preventive measures to avoid communal violence. however, speaker k prathiba bharati denied permission to the motion on the grounds that it was a sensitive issue and asked home minister t devender goud to make a statement on it. there was commotion in the house for some time with the bjp members led by n indersena reddy and congress members having a slanging match on the issue. goud assured the assembly that precautionary measures had been taken to prevent any outward incident on march 15, the date scheduled for the performance of puja by the vhp. goud said the intelligence department and the police were taking necessary steps and requested the members to pass on any information to the government about the issue. however, the mim members did not relent and they rushed into the well of the house carrying placards and shouted slogans against the government.	0	0	1	0	0

"new delhi: the once-hyped ayodhya cell headed by senior ias officer shatrughna sinha, with a full secretariat, has no work to do. it was an office set up by no less than pm atal bihari vajpayee in november 2001 with the sole aim of trying to solve the ayodhya issue. however, nobody in this office now has any role to play anymore or, for that matter, knows why they were posted here in the first place. the ayodhya cell was set up with the purpose of doing what vajpayee, home minister l k advani and defence minister george fernandes are trying to do right now: talk to the vhp, rss, sants, shankaracharyas as well as the muslim leaders. ""it is symptomatic of the importance that the government is now giving to the ayodhya issue all over again that the role of the cell has been relegated,"" says an official working in the cell. right now, the cell functions, or rather non-functions, from two rooms on the second floor of the vigyan bhavan annexe which also houses the justice liberhan commission, which for a decade has been trying to discover the cause of the babri masjid''s demolition. the justice k venkataswami commission probing into the tehelka scam is also located in the vigyan bhavan. singh, a former divisional commissioner of faizabad, uttar pradesh, keeps himself busy by collecting newspaper clippings on the ayodhya issue and taking telephone calls. the cell conducts no meetings with religious leaders related to the dispute, and neither receives nor dispatches letters or keeps files. its only files are news clippings. ""we come at 9 am, have lunch, attend to a couple of phone calls and wait for the wall clock to strike 5.30 pm,"" an official posted in the cell said. singh, a up cadre ias officer, refused to say anything on the ayodhya dispute on grounds that he was a small cog in the wheel and there were officials higher up (that is, politicians), to do the talking and decision-making. singh was appointed director of the cell in november last year by the cabinet secretariat after the pm announced the cells constitution. there were no terms of reference except his one-line appointment letter. ""we have a loose mandate. there are no terms of references,"" says an official with the cell. the cell was supposed to provide secretarial services and background to the union cabinet on the disputed land and demolished structure. however, till now, no one has sought its advice. singh has three employees (two personal secretaries and a peon).

This story is from March 7, 2002  gorakhpur: the vishwa hindu parishad has postponed the plan of issuing identity cards to the karsevaks from its golghar office here. the organising secretary of vhp kashi prant, swatantra kumar told times news network that about 2,500 karsevaks were enrolled at gorakhpur to participate in the karseva.they were scheduled to leave gorakhpur after march 9. however, under the changed circumstances they would now walk up to ayodhya in small batches, he said. meanwhile, the district administration has diverted the vehicular traffic on national highway number 28. the highway connects gorakhpur, deoria and kushinagar to lucknow through ayodhya. the diversion had been made to prevent the karsevaks from reaching the temple city. the movement of private vehicles was also blocked after khalilabad on wednesday. inspector general of police, gorakhpur zone, ram lal ram told times news network that the diversion of vehicular routes had been to prevent the karsevaks from congregating at ayodhya. as a precautionary measure, the routes of roadways buses from gorakhpur to lucknow too had been diverted.	0	0	1	0	0
"This story is from March 14, 2002  lucknow: for once, the intelligence agencies seem to be groping in the dark about what is happening and what is to happen in ayodhya on the eve of ""judgement day"", as some would like to call it. the peculiar situation created by statements and counter-statements, claims and counter-claims as also contradictions galore have the sleuths in a bind. ides of march can be ominus they know. but there is little they can do. to begin with the officials are baffled at the manner in which the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) supremo was allowed to camp in ayodhya despite an unannounced ban on his entry decided by the district authorities earlier. adding to it is ramchandra paramhans, head of the ram janambhoomi nyas, decision to donate carved stone on wednesday to the statutory receiver, in this case the commissioner of faizabad. these developments have given unexpected twists to the everchanging ayodhya scenario. in reports dashed off to their respective headquarters, the intelligence agencies have expressed fear of what might happen on march 15 and thereafter. but again, nothing that they have said is concrete. ""things are moving not only faster but also in such unexpected directions that we are finding it difficult to keep a track of the developments, leave alone forsee what is to come,"" admitted a senior official of the intelligence department. intelligence sources said that while the visit of singhal to ayodhya has come as a whiff of fresh air to the otherwise dampening enthusiasm of the rambhakts, it is not well-received by several quarters. ""the plan to donate stone by paramhans compounds the crises,"" the source said adding; ""it should not come as a surprise if a handful of ram bhakts force their way to a corner of the ""undisputed"" land and place the stone given by paramhans to make a structue of sorts. officials say that though the government seems to be following a formula to keep both sides in good humour, a slight shift this way or that during the course of the tight-rope walk could be hazardous. intelligence sources believe that had singhal been detained in lucknow itself the problems would have been reduced considerably. ""worse come to worse, there would have been some protests and demonstrations here and there, but that would have been all. having allowed him to go to ayodhya could be the first mistake by the administration,"" said an intelligence officer."	0	0	0	0	0
new delhi: opposition leaders met monday and made a joint appeal to the government to protect life and property in gujarat. among those who attended the meeting included congress president sonia gandhi, somnath chatterjee of the cpm and former prime minister of india chandrashekar. briefing newspersons after the meeting, roop chand pal (cpm) said that the leaders have demanded that a joint delegation of mps should be immediately sent to gujarat and arrangements be made to help them proceed in gujarat, unlike the four member lok morcha team which had to return from ahmedabad. the opposition leaders have said that they would stage a dharna if the joint delegation is not allowed to go to gujarat. chandrashekar, however, is reported to have said in the meeting that he was not in favour of dharnas, ``attempt should be made to unite, dharnas only divide,'''' sources quoting him said.

This story is from March 11, 2002  lucknow: governor vishnukant shastri said that options were still open for the formation of a popular government in uttar pradesh. aEURoethe doors are open for political parties, including the samajwadi party, to stake claim for formation of a stable government,aEUR he said. addressing a press conference here on saturday, the governor took pains to defend his decision of recommending the presidentaEUR(tm)s rule in the state. without naming the congress and the sp, he criticised both the parties for their role in the developments leading to the imposition of the central rule in the state. aEURoeone of the parties (read sp) cited the bommai case when it staked to form the government,aEUR said the governor. aEURoehowever, the bommai case was clear that its verdict was binding only in a situation where a government in power loses majority. in that case, the strength of the government will be proved only on the floor of the house,aEUR said shastri. chiding the congress, he said that the party leaders took shelter under the violent incidents in gujarat and said they needed time to think about their future strategy. aEURoestrangely enough, the same party could take decision on punjab, manipur and uttaranchal but kept quiet on up,aEUR he said. justifying his decision on recommending central rule in the state, he said there were examples when the single largest party had been asked to form the government as well as when the leader of the largest group had been asked to furnish letter of support before he was invited to form the government. aEURoeit is said that i made former governor of up romesh bhandari as role model while making this decision. but it is wrong. i made president kr narayanan as my role model and i did exactly what he had done when he faced with similar situation,aEUR said shastri. he further said that aEURoethe president of india had asked for letter of support from leaders of largest groups, i too did the same. narayanan individually asked every leader about his or her partyaEUR(tm)s position. i too followed the same practice. the parties told me that they are willing to sit in the opposition and will not support the sp. in that scenario i had no option but to recommend the presidentaEUR(tm)s rule,aEUR he added.	0	0	0	0	0

ahmedabad: for the media fraternity, february 28 is a day devoted to the union budget and the attendant knowledge of whether the cancer stick got dearer and the cup that cheers, cheaper. in gujarat, however, budget blues could not have been further from the public mind, as february 28, 2002, went down in the history of modern india as a shameful and communally- tainted chapter. cuts in fertiliser subsidies and increased surcharge taxes took a prominent backseat for the average journalist in town as simultaneously with the presentation of the budget, news of systematic burning of residential areas, ransacking and looting of shops came filtering in. on the terrace of the four-storeyed building in which the times of india office is housed, one could see at lunch hour, thick and menacing black smoke billowing from all directions of the city. at a guess, it was not just the minority-dominated old walled city across the sabarmati bridge, but posher shopping areas that were burning. one was suddenly aware of the discomfort level of colleagues belonging to the minority community, who were understandably worried about their families and homes. workmates came in through the day, bringing with them reports of arson and burning from different corners of the city. elite areas were targeted with swank departmental stores, electronics stores and restaurants being gutted. several reporters staying in the dreaded communally-sensitive areas expressed their mute, yet angry helplessness at being unable to come to work. by late evening, the toll of violence-related deaths was rising. reports of mediapersons being roughed up and cameras being smashed kept coming in, especially from godhra and vadodara. colleagues huddled together discussing which was the safest bet for an atm and which was the safest route home. on the way back home, near the underbridge close to this correspondentaEUR(tm)s home, more black smoke. was it tyres or a car, one wondered. later, one learnt that it was the newly-opened beauty parlour by a young lady from the minority community that had earned the ire of hooligans. while cable operators had called it a day, they were kind enough to be beaming news channels through which one learnt about the ghastly episode of ehsaan jaffrey, an ex-congress mp being dragged out and burnt alive. jaffrey, it seems, had opened fire in defence when the mob was hedging in closer, and this was the fatal cue for which the angry crowds were waiting for. jaffrey and his family couldnaEUR(tm)t escape their ire. at least 25-odd tenements, (mostly of the minority community) in gulbarg society in chamanpura were also gutted. what was most frustrating for citizens who craved for peace was the absolute apathy of the local bureaucracy, especially the police, in restoring law and order. buses, trucks, cars, scooters, anything that the mob could lay its hands upon, not hesitating to raze even a honda city showroom. before the embers of the communal frenzy ignited on thursday night could die down, gunfights between different communities broke out as soon as friday dawned in.

This story is from March 8, 2002  kolkata: at least 15 per cent of the people affected by the gujarat earthquake are suffering from long-term mental health morbidity and need specialised psychiatric treatment. this was stated in a report prepared jointly by indian council of medical research (icmr) and institute of human behaviour & allied sciences (ihbas). released recently by union health minister c.p. thakur, the report claimed that about 30 to 50 per cent people are suffering from moderate to severe psychological disturbances. the report is based on the experience and observations of a team of doctors, headed by dr nimesh desai of ihbas, who attended the quake victims. according to the study, effort should be concentrated on indirect relief measures like employment generation. aEURoepsychological recovery has been linked to micro and macro economics as well as the rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes. many communities and their leaders favour indirect relief measures like employment generation scheme over the direct assistance schemes for food or housing for the social and mental health of the affected population,aEUR the report claimed. health care providers should have been more sensitive to the psychiatric needs of the people, said the report. it observed, aEURoeexcept for a few individuals or teams, there was barely any effort on the part of healthcare providers. so, a sensitisation and training is needed.aEUR while praising the media for their role in helping mobilising national and international support, the report claimed that many of the victims suffered from shock after seeing images in the audio-visual media. men and women suffered equally from the trauma. the report warned against unskilled or untrained psychological counselling. aEURoetraining for relief and rescue workers, who made spontaneous and intuitive efforts to assist the population in dealing with psychological disturbancesaEUR are to be encouraged. there is a need to focus on the emotional and psychological experience of relief workers as well as healthcare providers, including support groups. as a remedial measure, the study urged the gujarat government and other national and international agencies to prepare a long-term plan to combine service delivery and service research aspects.	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 13, 2002  lucknow: senior vice-president of the state unit of the samajwadi party bhagwati singh on tuesday slammed the bjp and the frontal organisations of the sangh parivar for speaking with a forked tongue on the vexed ayodhya issue. addressing a press conference, singh said the doublespeak of these organisations was in consonance with a deep-rooted conspiracy to create communal tension. he said the bjp, vhp, rss and shiv sena were issuing contradictory statements on the temple issue with only one intent in mind: to vitiate the atmosphere and sow the seeds of communal divide.	0	0	0	0	0
"new delhi: the vajpayee government breathed a sigh of relief on thursday as vhp leader ashok singhal, in his capacity as managing trustee of the ramjanambhoomi nyas, gave a commitment to abide by the court verdict in the ayodhya case, even as the kanchi shankaracharya declared that the government would deal only with the rjn, and the vhp should stay out. this has now re-opened the possibility of the government permitting the bhoomi puja in ayodhya on march 15 -- on which a final decision is yet to be taken. however, government sources stressed that it had been made clear to the rjn that the bhoomi puja, if permitted, would have to be a symbolic affair. it would have to be ""scaled down, with no bringing in of building material or carved pillars, and no concentration of kar sevaks"". further, restrictions on kar sevaks entering ayodhya could only be lifted once the vhp agreed that they would not come there. but it is not clear whether singhal was speaking in his individual capacity with rjn chief ramchandra paramhans -- who had written to the pm on march 5 only promising status quo till the court verdict -- remaining incommunicado and other vhp leaders silent. for the pm personally, this crisis has another dimension: several young bjp ministers told the home minister recently that if the government did not accede to the vhp demands, there was not much sense in carrying on with this government. as one minister put it, "" the bjp leadership has lost all credibility with its cadres, and has to do something to end that alienation first."" at the same time, the nda allies, barring the shiv sena, want to know the implications of singhal's statement.

"new delhi: there are more reports filtering in that the attack on the sabarmati express in godhra that led to the communal carnage in gujarat, was not a pre-medidated one. times news network had earlier quoted intelligence officials in delhi as saying that there is no concrete evidence linking the attack to the isi or outside forces. a washington post investigative report from godhra has also discredited the theory that the train carnage was a ""terrorist attack."" interviews with a cross-section, including eye-witnesses, suggest that ""the train fire was not a premeditated ambush, but rather a spontaneous argument, provoked by the vhp activists, that went out of control,"" says the report. a police official is quoted as saying, ""both sides were at fault. the provocation was there and the reaction was strong. but no one had imagined all this would turn into such a big tragedy."" in an interview to the post, b k nanavati, the deputy police superintendent of godhra, has also said the investigation does not support the contention that assault on the train was a ""terrorist attack."" ""it was not preplanned. it was a sudden, provocative incident"", he said. the report in the washington post says ""provocation by the activists in the form of sustained hooliganism preceded retaliation. there were several prior incidents of misconduct but perhaps the spark was lit by the refusal of some activists to pay to the platform vendors for their tea."" ""for two days, as the sabarmati express snaked across northern india, some activists in cars s-5 and s-6 carried on like hooligans. they exposed themselves to other passengers. they pulled head scarves off women. they evicted a family of four in the middle of the night for refusing to join in chants. they failed to pay for tea and snacks they consumed at each stop,"" says the report. thus the reputation of the rowdiest passengers had travelled before the train which was late by several hours largely because of the activists'' behaviour. according to an intelligence official here, ""unlike the december attack on the indian parliament or the attack on the american center in kolkata where the involvement of outside agencies was proved beyond doubt, there is no concrete evidence as yet to link the gujarat carnage to `outside forces.'' "" this obviously hints towards a complete failure of the establishment in gujarat to control the situation. home minister l k advani, minister of state i d swamy, the bjp as well as the ministry of extenal affairs spokesperson have in various forums talked of the role of the isi and the underworld dons in the riots in gujarat as well as the attack on the sabarmati express. minister of state omar abdullah quickly withdrew his statement that the riots were due to `local factors'' and issued a clarification that his utterances were in a personal and not official capacity. there were reports from kolkata that some terrorists linked to the gujarat carnage had been arrested, but the reports were quickly denied by the government.

This story is from March 2, 2002  hyderabad: the all india bandh called by the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) to protest the godhra killings evoked mixed response in the twin cities of hyderabad and secunderabad on friday. while shops and business establishments in secunderabad and other parts of the new city remained closed for most part of the day, normalcy was not affected in majority of the old city localities in hyderabad. additional police commissioner k aravinda rao said over 30 activists of vhp and bjp, including two bjp corporators, were taken into custody at different places, for deflating bus tyres and coercing shopkeepers to down the shutters. large contingents of rapid action force, andhra pradesh special police and indian reserve battalions, besides the city police, were deployed for bandobust duties. the protesters deflated the tyres of about 10 buses and pelted stones on some buses at shamsheegunj and chatrinaka areas. as a precautionary measure, the andhra pradesh state road transport corporation (apsrtc) partially withdrew bus services in the old city and some other communally sensitive localities in the morning, but began plying the buses later in the day. attendance at government and private sector offices was thin as several preferred to remain indoors, anticipating possible trouble during the bandh. several schools and colleges have also declared a holiday. the city bjp unit, which had earlier announced of taking out of silent protest rally against the godhra killings from baghlingampally to indira park on friday morning, cancelled its plans. the east zone police reportedly denied permission for the rally and also persuaded the bjp leaders to maintain restraint. meanwhile, a majority of the shops in secunderabad and other areas of city, which were closed in the morning, resumed business in the evening. vhp state working president d v r sharma later told reporters at the organisationaEUR(tm)s office here that the bandh was a total success. he said the kar sevaks would proceed to ayodhya despite the governmentaEUR(tm)s restriction and undertake construction of ram temple as decided on march 15.	0	1	1	0	0
new delhi: defence minister george fernandes, who visited different areas of gujarat in the last couple of days to oversee the deployment of army to quell the large-scale violence, left for the strife-torn state again on sunday evening.  officials said fernandes, who returned from ahmedabad late on saturday night and later briefed prime minister vajpayee and others on the situation, would be travelling to surat and some areas ``in the interiors'''' this time.  both the union and state governments have been criticised for reacting late in inducting the army into the violence-hit state. by the time the cabinet committee on security, which asked the army to be on ``stand-by'''', met on thursday evening, gujarat was already up in flames.  apart from the delay in requisitioning the army, the state government too did not reportedly provide sufficient logistical support to the army in time. consequently, the army could be deployed in ahmedabad and other towns only more than 50 hours had elapsed after the godhra train incident last wednesday morning.  according to sources, fernandes was unhappy with the way the situation has been handled by the narendra modi ministry and felt the state government was not co-operative with the army.

"hyderabad: under attack from allies on the issue of allowing symbolic puja at the undisputed site at ayodhya, prime minister atal bihari vajpayee on thursday sought to mollify his crucial ally tdp, saying the attorney-general's submission before supreme court reflected his personal interpretation but not government's viewpoint, andhra pradesh chief minister n chandrababu naidu said here. ""i spoke to the prime minister this morning. he told me that the attorney-general did not consult the government (before seeking permission from supreme court for a symbolic puja),"" the tdp supremo told reporters. naidu, who made no secret of his unhappiness over centre's response to the issue, said vajpayee had assured that 'firm steps' would be taken to implement the apex court order that rejected any religious activity at the undisputed site at ayodhya. he said he told vajpayee to ensure that the status quo was not disturbed at any cost in the interests of the country's unity and integrity. ""since uttar pradesh is now under the control of the central government, it is fully responsible to implement the court order,"" naidu said. terming as 'incorrect' soli sorabjee's submission before the apex court favouring symbolic bhoomi pujan, naidu said such a stand had created ""doubts in the minds of the people and political parties"". asked whether he believed that attorney-general could have acted on his own on such a sensitive matter, naidu, whose tdp is a crucial outside supporter of the bjp-led coalition, quipped, ""let us not give scope for interpretations"". tdp, he said, had been consistently maintaining that the vexed ayodhya issue should be left to the decision of the court and all parties and organisations should abide by it. stating that the recent 'painful developments' had caused damage to the country's image at international level, he said it was ""high time"" that all parties realised the futility of politicising such sensitive issues and strictly abide by the court verdict. without naming the parties, naidu said some political parties had, over a period of time, complicated the temple issue, some out of ""ignorance while others for political mileage"". ""since the efforts of religious and political leaders have failed to yield results, the only option before the country is to adhere to the court judgement,"" the chief minister added. meanwhile, the tdp politburo, which met here on wednesday night, reviewed the situation arising out of the order of the supreme court on ayodhya issue. the meeting, chaired by naidu, took exception to the stand taken by attorney-general and said his plea before the court, favouring symbolic puja, was 'not in conformity' with the nda's stand. ""this (sorabjee's submission) is in sharp contrast to pm's statement that we have failed to arrive at a consensus and court ruling alone will be a proper solution,"" the tdp said. reiterating its commitment to secularism and national integrity, the party felt that ayodhya issue should be left to the court and all political parties, religious groups and leaders should help in maintaining peace and harmony. ""over the years, many attempts were made by various governments, political parties, religious leaders and others to arrive at a solution for ayodhya issue. ""since no consensus could be arrived at, it was rightly felt that the issue be left to the court and everybody should abide by it,"" the politburo said.  Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0

"new delhi: a majority in the sangh parivar - whether in the rss itself or in the bjp and the vhp - want the godhra carnage to be delinked from the vhp build-up in ayodhya and has expressed unhappiness with appeals of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee and home minister l k advani to the vhp to scale down the temple stir in view of the communal conflagration in gujarat. aEUR~aEUR~why does the government want to fall into the opposition trap and use gujarat to cow down the vhp?aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) asked an rss source. several bjp mps, too, said they greatly resented the curbs placed on karsewaks entering ayodhya. their uniform line is that godhra is part of a series that includes the aEUR~aEUR~isi-inspired terroristaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) attacks on the kashmir assembly and parliament. as for ramjanambhoomi, vhp leader say it should be addressed separately, and that the government must go to dharmacharyas and give them a aEUR~aEUR~written assuranceaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm), permitting them to place the pillars on the acquired site as the culmination of the year-long purnahuti yagya on march 15. only then would it be willing to postpone the announcement of the precise date of temple construction. the bjpaEUR(tm)s central leadership, taken aback at the resentment in the party (seen on thursday when bjp mps harangued pm vajpayee and home minister advani), the sangh and the vhp to its apparent aEUR~aEUR~capitulationaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm), tried hard on friday to regain some ground with its own people. on thursday, the pm and advani asked the rss to aEUR~aEUR~mediateaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) with the vhp on its behalf, and later hrd minister murli manohar joshi and bjp mp balasaheb apte met rss leaders to try and work out a formula. rss chief sudershan also has been in touch with some vhp leaders. one formula being discussed, reportedly, is that the law ministry should request the supreme court to permit a part of the acquired land to be handed over the vhp before march 12. while the publicly stated priority is to check communal violence in gujarat, bjp ministers are apparently having to first prove their credentials with their own cadre. on friday, advani came to parliament with a prepared statement which would set some aEUR~aEUR~doubtsaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) at rest. but when he was not allowed to do so, he called an impromptu press briefing at which he gave the details of the godhra carnage without any reference to the ayodhya issue. asked about his earlier statement - that the vhp build-up in ayodhya could lead to a serious law and order situation, which the government would not hesitate to deal with - he said he did not have anything to add. bjp leaders say they will tide over the present crisis, but then the partyaEUR(tm)s abysmal performance in the recent assembly polls has apparently triggered off a debate in the sangh parivar: whether this government should be aEUR~aEUR~savedaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) to fight another day or whether, since its electoral downslide is being attributed to its shelving the hindutva agenda, it was time to cut its losses and begin afresh. thus far, the tilt is towards the first aEUR"" saving the government.

"new delhi: in a candid admission, prime minister atal bihari vajpayee on tuesday said the bjp and its allies were ""punished"" by the electorate due to their ""shortcomings"" in the recent assembly elections. ""janata ne humein shayad hamari kuch kamiyon ke liye saja di hai (perhaps the people have punished us for some of our shortcomings),"" he said, adding he hoped that the bjp and its allies would go in for ""self-introspection"" so as to remove the shortcomings to win back the confidence of the people. the prime minister stated this while addressing the rashtriya sadhbhavna diwas organised by the arya samaj here. on gujarat, he defended chief minister narendra modi, in the eye of a storm over opposition demand for his sacking, and asked the political parties not to derive political mileage out of the carnage. ""inquiry has been ordered and truth will come out,"" he said, adding that some people were attempting to take political mileage out of the gujarat violence. ""i want them not to do so,"" he said. he said it was for the first time that a communal riot was brought under control within 72 hours in the state. turning to pakistan, he ruled out resumption of talks with islamabad till cross-border terrorism stopped. he said new delhi wanted friendly ties with islamabad but what was needed was creation of conducive atmosphere for resumption of talks.

"crushing defeat in one assembly after another. spectre of saffron-tinged rioting across the country. administrative helplessness reminiscent of november 1984 (anti-sikh riots) and december 1992 (demolition of babri masjid). and finally, after a swingeing budget, middle-class disillusionment with the bjp, once the great white hope of urban india. is it the beginning of the end for the nda? it is not necessary that a successive routs should rock the government at the centre. indira gandhi completed a term through electoral reverses in the states, as did rajiv gandhi and narasimha rao. however, it was thumbs down for all three, when the big elections came around: indira was facing a defeat in the lok sabha elections when she died. son rajiv exited office ingloriously. and rao met with the same fate. comparisons with the unstable governments at the centre in 1989, 1990 and 1996 are futile because each self-destructed before a substantive electoral verdict could be delivered. on the other hand, the nda, for all that it was written off, has shown remarkable staying power. with every crisis, the nda bandwagon has paradoxically grown longer. consider a few examples. the biju janata dal splits, but both factions opt to stay with the nda. the marumalarchi dmk (mdmk) exits from the dmk alliance, but not the nda. for the mdmk leader, vaiko, there is aEUR~aEUR~no greater leader than vajpayeeji.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) the pattali makkal katchi (pmk) quits the nda to join jayalalithaaEUR(tm)s aiadmk, only to return five months on. party chief ramdoss insists he has aEUR~aEUR~full faith in the leadership of vajpayeeji.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) ditto with the mercurial mamata banerji. she storms out of the nda, dallies with sonia but trudges back, singing the familiar song about aEUR~aEUR~strengthening vajpayeejiaEUR(tm)s hands.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) if all this lavish praise has overwhelmed vajpayeeji, he has seen nothing yet. the latest on the coalition front is that bitter rivals, dmk and aiadmk, are vying for his affections. this is a political wonder made all the more remarkable by the ndaaEUR(tm)s dismal electoral record. in 1998, the coalition lost rajasthan, madhya pradesh and delhi. in 1999, the nda earned a second term courtesy kargil, but lost karnataka and maharashtra assemblies. in 2000, the nda partners mounted an extraordinary offensive against biharaEUR(tm)s laloo yadav, but suffered a shock defeat. in 2001, tamil nadu and assam proved a write off, as did the biggest surprise of them all, west bengal. today, the coalition has lost its mandate in punjab, uttaranchal and most crucially, up. just why hasnaEUR(tm)t the coalition unravelled? the answer to this lies in the predicament that is peculiar to the ndaaEUR(tm)s allies. put simply, it is a case of your enemyaEUR(tm)s enemy being your friend. the congress is a political enemy not just of the bjp, but of most the nda partners aEUR"" the telugu desam, the national conference, the dmk, the akali dal, the bjiu janata dal, the indian national lok dal and the shiv sena. the cpm is again a common enemy of the bjp and the trinamool congress. and the numbers are such that no alternative coalition can come up without the congress and the cpm. it is true that many of the bjpaEUR(tm)s current partners had earlier co-habited with the congress. the congress propped up the united front governments, among whose constituents were dmk and tdp. however, these coalitions came apart precisely because of this contradiction. is the nda invincible, then? no. the bedrock on which the nda stands is the jointly drafted aEUR~aEUR~national agendaaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) which categorically rejects ayodhya. when the same issue returns, and on a scale so large as to threaten the peace of the country, the constituents can hardly afford not to rethink their strategies. if not in the interest of the country, then, certainly in the interest of their own ostensibly secular constituencies. when that happens, it may be over to sonia gandhi.

ayodhya: the aEUR~aEUR~ayodhya bombaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) is ticking away and the vishwa hindu parishad and the bajrang dal have made elaborate plans to spark it off on march 15 when they attempt to zero in on the disputed site at 2.51 p.m. even though the vhp has so far maintained that there was no change in its programme, a crucial meeting of the aEUR~aEUR~mandir nirman samitiaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) has been convened here on march 14 to give final shape to their march 15 programme. the meeting assumes importance as the aEUR~aEUR~dharam sansadaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) (religious parliament) has given full authority to the samiti and its chairman ramchandra paramhans das to take any decision on how to go about ram temple construction and when to start it. aEUR~aEUR~only the samiti is authorised to defer or effect any change in the march 15 programme,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says a senior vhp leader. even though mahant das has softened on the vhp agitation after chief minister rajnath singh called on him on thursday, there is no let-up in its build-up and preparations for the march 15 programme. a group of engineers, engaged to carry out construction of ram temple, held closed-door meetings with the vhp leaders here on wednesday, giving final shape to their construction plan. chief architect chandrakant bhai sompura has already visited the construction site (acquired land) and discussed how to ferry heavy stones and pillars. a retired engineer from lucknow has also been included in the team. a private firm has been engaged for hiring five new cranes to execute the programme for moving them into the disputed site along with carved pillars and pre-fabricated bricks. one crane is already being used in one of its workshops in ayodhya. for the convenience of ram sevaks to ferry heavy carved stones to the ram janambhoomi complex, orders have been placed to buy about 250 hand-pushed carts. about 25 tractor-trolleys and 10 trucks will be hired to carry heavy pillars to the disputed site. a bulldozer is also being hired to level the ground. the vhp plans to install three cranes each at workshops and near the acquired land for loading and off-loading the carved pillars, pre-fabricated bricks and other building material. about 30 trucks of carved stones are lying at the two workshops in rajasthan. plans are afoot to dispatch the trucks and material in the first week of march to ayodhya where it will be off-loaded at its workshops and ramsevakpuram. no more guerrilla tactics. it will be an open defiance of the supreme court order. instead of thronging the disputed site from all corners, as they did in 1990 and 1992, the vhp and the bajrang dal activists, led by mahant ramchandra paramhans das, the vhpaEUR(tm)s working president ashok singhal, will take the main hanumangarhi route to penetrate the impregnable ram janambhoomi complex. the cadre mobilisation has already begun and on an average about 10,000 ram sevaks are landing here daily. with state administration denying entry to fresh batches of ram sevaks, the vhp and the bajrang dal have alerted their neighbouring district units in faizabad, gonda, sultanpur, rae bareli, bahraich and barabanki to be ready to move into ayodhya on short notice any time after march 12.

This story is from March 2, 2002  hyderabad: the union government has decided to move the court to expedite the case on the disputed site in ayodhya, according to union minister for rural development m venkaiah naidu. talking to reporters here on friday, he reiterated that the union government was determined to see that status quo was maintained at the disputed site. he said law had started taking its course unlike in 1992. ayodhya had been fortified and the kar sevaks who had already reached ayodhya were being dispersed. naidu appealed to the vishwa hindu parishad to postpone their decision on temple construction at the disputed site from march 15. he said, aEURoethe agony of the vhp leaders is understandable but they should also know that the government was duty-bound by constitution and cannot and will not allow anyone to enter the disputed site.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) referring to the violence in gujarat, he said it could be a conspiracy by certain anti-national elements to destabilise the nda government. naidu said the godhra incident which was the genesis of violence in gujarat required a detailed inquiry and hence the gujarat government had ordered a judicial probe. condemning the barbaric attack on the sabarmati express at godhra on wednesday, he said the union and the state governments were trying to find out the truth. naidu said certain agencies which had the support of pakistan were trying to incite violence in the country. appealing to all political parties to cooperate with the government in restoring peace and order in gujarat, he said the sequence of events indicated that the first attack on the train was not an emotional outburst. he appealed to political groups to cut across party lines and have aEURoecommon standardsaEUR on such issues. he said most of the parties were adopting aEURoepseudo secularaEUR attitude and reacted violently when the minority community was affected but responded in a lukewarm manner when the majority community was at the receiving end. any violation of law was wrong and it resulted in social disharmony, he added.	0	0	0	0	0
"lucknow: ram janmabhoomi nyas (rjn) chairman mahant ramchandra paramhans das dropped yet another bombshell by refusing to follow the undertaking given by vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) working-president ashok singhal that the vhp would abide by the court verdict on the temple dispute. in a telephonic interview with times news network on sunday, mahant das said: ""there is no question of the ram janmabhoomi nyas and ram sevaks following the court verdict if it is against temple construction."" ""i have not given any undertaking that i have to follow any court verdict. ask those who have given it,"" said an infuriated mahant das, who is also chairman of the mandir nirman samiti. ""kaisa court, kaisa faisla? faisla toh ho chuka hai ram mandir banane ka. ab toh mandir he banega (what court, what verdict? the decision has already been taken to construct the ram temple, so only the temple will be constructed),"" he said contrary to the undertaking given by singhal. significantly, the vhp working-president had given the undertaking to the centre as the managing-trustee of the rjn. with the rjn chairman mahant das rejecting singhal''s undertaking, serious differences seem to have cropped up within the nyas on the key issue. mahant das reiterated his decision to stay away from the vhp''s march 15 ''symbolic shila pujan'' programme till ram sevaks were allowed to carry out bhoomi pujan as planned before the delhi talks. ""main bhiksha nahi maang raha. bhoomi meri hain aur uspe puja ka adhkiar bhi mera hain. mera virodh prateekatmak puja se hain (i am not begging. it is our land and we have all right to perform puja there. i am opposed to symbolic puja),"" he said. on his participation in the march 15 vhp-sponsored programme, mahant das said: ""we will stay away if only symbolic puja is allowed."" the digambar akhara mahant ridiculed kanchi seer jayendra saraswati''s formula to perform symbolic puja. ""what is symbolic puja? as a seer, will he give permission for such puja to be performed anywhere?"" quipped mahant das. the rjn chairman charged prime minister atal behari vajpayee with lying again. reacting to the pm leaving the decision on the march 15 ceremony on the supreme court, mahant das questioned the motive behind calling them all to delhi ""when nothing was in his hands"". ""both the pm and union home minister l.k. advani are liars. they say one thing and do exactly the opposite,"" he fumed. mahant das also did not spare union minister of state for home i d swami, who visited ayodhya on friday. ""woh bari bari baate kar ke gaya. lekin kya hua? (he came and made tall promises but what happened thereafter?)"" asked mahant das referring to there being no let-up in the security restrictions. with all-india muslim personal law board also rejecting kanchi seer jayendra sarswati''s formula to allow ''symbolic puja'' at the disputed site on march 15, a confrontation-like situation seems imminent as the vhp has given the go-ahead for the march towards the disputed site on march 15. vhp, bajrang dal and durga vahini activists have been directed to reach ayodhya in large numbers on march 15 to take part in the vhp march. ""our programme stands and there is no change in it. we are ready to face bullets but march towards ram janmabhoomi complex at 14.51 pm with carved stones,"" declared purshottam narain singh, vhp state president. related storiesA board has no role in dispute: vhpA one dead in bengal police-vhp clashA i did all i could: kanchi seerA dialogue must continue: vajpayeeA sena''s ram sevaks leave for ayodhya    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	1	0	1	0	1

"This story is from March 13, 2002  vadodara: the gujarat electricity board (geb) has temporarily lifted from tuesday the three-hour evening power-cut on high- and low-tension non-continuous processing industries, imposed from november last. a geb source told the tnn on tuesday that the load-shedding was withdrawn up to march 25 and the decision would be reviewed afterwards. load-shedding was from 1800 hrs to 2100 hrs everyday . the decision on lifting the power-cut was taken following demands from the vadodara chamber of commerce and industries, forum of gujarat industries association and chambers, federation of gujarat industries and other industries associations. industries, which suffered heavy damage during the riots, had demanded withdrawal of restrictions on power usage so that they could work overtime and make up for the losses. geb was compelled to put restrictions on industries, its major revenue source, under pressure from farm and rural lobbies who allege that geb is ""soft"" towards industries. the unrestricted demand for power now stands at 8,350 mw, while restricted demand is 7,900 mw. the gap between demand and supply made the geb impose restrictions, sources said. the power system was operating at a critical level of 48.2 khz, much below the standard frequency level of 50 khz. there has been no evening power-cut in towns and rural areas following the riots. capacity shortage also added to geb''s woes. due to this, towns had been observing half-an-hour power cut in the evening on a rotation basis since november last."	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 9, 2002  mumbai: the state police have launched a massive operation against kar sevaks moving towards ayodhya.  reacting to intelligence inputs, that large-scale reprisal acts could take place in view of the violence in gujarat, the state police have ordered that immediate preventive action should be taken against as many kar sevaks as possible.  as a result, around 681 kar sevaks belonging to the vishwa hindu parishad, (vhp) the bajrang dal and the durga vahini have already been booked in the state.  the state headquarters has also ordered that all policemen on leave should be recalled and barring medical emergencies all leave to police personnel stands cancelled.  in a terse note sent over the wireless, the state police headquarters has asked all police commissioners, district and railway police chiefs to provide immediate information of the action taken against the kar sevaks.  ``it has been noticed that communication of action taken regarding important events is not promptly reported to the state police control room,'''' the note states.  the state control room has also sought a daily report from each district regarding important events in their area by 4 a.m. each day. officials have been instructed to ensure compliance of the same over the phone.  the wireless messages also note that a large number of kar sevaks are proceeding to ayodhya from various parts of the state despite the fact that the district administration of faizabad in uttar pradesh has already issued prohibitory orders in and around the temple town.  the intelligence machinery in maharashtra has observed that over 2,500 kar sevaks had already visited ayodhya before february 27 when it received orders from the union home ministry to act against them. of these, around 1,300 kar sevaks participated in the poornahuti yagna that began at ayodhya on february 24.  the vhp has directed all its district units to mobilise 1000 ``ram sevaks'''' each for the 101-day yagna programme in ayodhya. the vhp hopes that over 20 lakh kar sevaks will gather in ayodhya during this period.  the union home ministry has also alerted all state headquarters and asked them to prevent the kar sevaks from reaching ayodhya. however, the state intelligence agencies have found that despite clear instructions a large number of kar sevaks are still travelling to ayodhya.  the union home ministry has ordered that all ground-level intelligence should be directly shared with central intelligence agencies.  the state government apprehends reprisal killings in many places in view of the march 13 deadline set by the vhp for a `bhoomipujan'' at the disputed site in ayodhya in the backdrop of the communal violence at godhra in which 58 kar sevaks returning from ayodhya were burnt alive.  on march 5, another message relayed by the state headquarters to all police commissioners and district superintendents says that the continuous influx of kar sevaks towards ayodhya could cause unprecedented chaos and will eventually create a serious law and order situation. the message goes on to warn that the movement of the kar sevaks should be stopped immediately and any laxity in this regard will be viewed adversely.  intelligence officials blamed local police officials for the violence in murbad near thane on march 1 during the maharashtra bandh called by the vhp and on march 6 in bhingar in ahmednagar, an already communally sensitive town, which reported sporadic violence when some obscene messages were found written on a school blackboard.	0	1	1	0	0

"This story is from March 7, 2002  ahmedabad: it''s a strange coincidence. apparently, the news of sonia gandhi''s visit to gujarat happens to coincide with the state machinery waking up from its slumber and begin the much-needed relief work. the ahmedabad collector and state relief commissioner claim that besides starting new relief camps, help has been pouring in the existing ones for the last two days - nearly four days after violence broke out in the state. ""we are on our toes for the last two days, having helped over 17,000 people in 14 relief camps. around nine camps have been started through the aanganwadi - government relief providing body,"" says g c murmu, state relief commissioner. however, a visit to some of the city relief camps gives a completely different picture. speaking to most of the relief camps revealed that official help started coming only from tuesday. ""they should''ve swung into action the very next day. what were they waiting for, for so long!"" thundered chairman standing committee, amc, badruddin sheikh. and though help may have started reaching the camps, it is nowhere close to what is needed, believe many. ""we had handed over the list of our demands - basic amenities like water, tents, medical aid and of course, food - on friday itself. however, it was only on tuesday that some people from the collectorate visited our camp. and all that we were provided with, was a very small quantity of foodgrain which can hardly suffice for the 3,500 people staying here. however, drinking water remains the biggest problem,"" says inamul iraqi of the shahibaug dariakhan ghummat relief camp. people at almost all the relief camps share the same sentiments. ""we received some flour and foodgrain on wednesday. besides food, we need medicines and more toilets. if things continue like this, there could be an outbreak of diseases,"" says yakubbhai of the bhogilal ni chal relief camp at rajpur ''tol naka'', which houses around 500 affected people. so while the collectorate sources claim to have reached out to 11,400 people, providing them with 80 ''boris'' (sacks) each of flour and foodgrain, people at relief camps deny having received any. ""if they call a 2.5 kg bag a sack, it''s their misconception,"" is how an organiser at the jahangirnagar amina masjid relief camp at vatva reacted. the silver lining, however, is all the work done by several non-government organisations throughout the city. around 21 organisations have been providing succour to the affected people under the banner of citizen''s initiative. it was the st xavier''s social service society (sxsss) that reached out to the strife-torn areas with cooked food on thursday itself. ""in no time, we managed to garner support from a lot of other voluntary organisations,"" says fr victor moses, director of sxsss. ""just now, we are focusing only on the camps, supplying food items, medicines, clothes and tarpaulin sheets. there are around 20 camps with 35 to 40,000 people. the relief teams are constantly facing the problems of security. we requested the police commissioner for escorting the convoy, but he refused. however, the meeting with the collector has been positive,"" says a citizen''s initiative source.

new delhi: the bjp-led central government has begun exploring the possibility of permitting bhoomi puja in ayodhya on march 15. this comes in the wake of an assurance from the kanchipuram shankaracharya that the ceremony would be aEUR~aEUR~symbolic, without building materials, carved pillars or concentration of kar sevaksaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). he gave this assurance at a meeting chaired by prime minister vajpayee on thursday night. the shankaracharya has conveyed this to the all-india muslim personal law board and said the question of handing over the undisputed land will be dealt with after march 15. their response is awaited. government sources said besides ensuring the security situation in ayodhya was conducive, muslim approval was essential to aEUR~aEUR~sellaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) the puja to the bjpaEUR(tm)s allies and the opposition. vhp cadres have not taken kindly to ashok singhalaEUR(tm)s promise in his capacity as managing trustee of the ramjanambhoomi nyas that the court verdict in the ayodhya case would be obeyed. the promise may have made it possible for the government to consider allowing the puja, but vhp cadres view it as a sell-out. on friday, vhpaEUR(tm)s international president v h dalmia said the vhp would obey the court verdict, but if it went against the rjn, the dharmacharyas would decide the next step. asked if he was not contradicting singhalaEUR(tm)s statement on thursday that if the verdict went in favour of the muslims, the garbha griha location would be changed, he evaded a direct reply. much spadework behind the scenes is understood to have been done by spiritual leader sri sri ravi shankar. the guru reportedly held extensive discussions with vhp leader ashok singhal and persuaded him to give the clearest possible written commitment that his organisation will abide by the court verdict. sri sri ravi shankar is also said to be holding parleys with a cross section of muslim leaders to find a durable settlement to the ayodhya crisis. vhp joint general secretary onkar bhave said the bhoomi puja would be incomplete without shifting building materials, carved pillars and at least 2,000 kar sevaks. simultaneously, 14 bjp mps from up held out a veiled threat of confrontation with the government. in a letter to the pm on thursday, they said the aEUR~aEUR~anger among people is increasing, and soon it would be manifested against the governmentaEUR(tm)s hitler-like tactics on the streets.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) the impact of this letter was felt on friday when minister of state for home id swami, who has gone to ayodhya to assess the security situation, announced the lifting of curbs on the residents of ayodhya, permission for pilgrims, not kar sevaks, and resumption of trains from saturday.

"This story is from March 2, 2002  bharuch: hope survives and love lives on in times of strife in this communally sensitive town. while gujarat burns and communal riots threaten to shatter the bond of harmony, in the quiet parsiwad area on the bank of narmada, a hindu and a muslim family keep the flames of hope alive. mohammed khanderao and ramanlal naryandas mali''s families have been living together, sharing the same kitchen and house for the past 44 years. their children have been brought up together, taught virtues and beliefs of both faiths and did not forsake each other even in crises. ""my elder daughter sona''s kanyadan was performed by mohammedbhai. my son amit was named by him. similarly, mohammedbhai and mumtazben''s two daughters jasmine and seema, were named by us"", says late ramanlal''s wife ramila patel. ""ramanlal and i have been staying together since our bachelor days, when we struggled to ensure a decent life. even after our marriage, we decided to live under the same roof with our families"", says mohammedbhai, who is into horticulture business. mohammedbhai has five daughters -mehzabin, jasmine, zeenat, seema and minaz, while ramanlal has three children, daughters sona and jyotika and son amit. recently, when mohammedbhai and his wife mumtaz had gone for haj pilgrimage, his daughters were under the care of ramilaben. ""mohammedkaka is like my father and his daughters are my sisters"", says amit. even today jasmine, who is married and settled in us, sends rakhi to amit. ""on id, we all eat sheer khurma and get idi. on diwali, mohammedkaka brings firecrackers and sweets for us. we celebrate our festivals together"", amit says. ramila, strictly a vegetarian, does not mind cooking meat and feeding her muslim daughters. similarly, on sitlasatam both patels and khanderaos refrain from eating ''freshly cooked food''. ""my faith is in my heart. i am a caste hindu but that does not bar me from loving mehzabin, zeenat, jasmine, seema and minaz. for them, i am as much a mother as i am for my daughters"", says ramilaben. ""i am a practising muslim and islam does not teach me to hate other religions. even koran says that ""allah is rabbil-alamin which means ''lord of all'' and not merely ''rabbil-muslamin'' that is ''lord of muslims alone''"", mohammedbhai says. the tradition of mutual respect and love is passed on to the next generation. while ramanlal''s son amit prides himself in saying that he is the only brother of seven sisters, his son-in-law haresh hirabhai mali considers mohammedbhai as his guardian. ""i have been associated with these two families for the past nine years. never have i felt that the two belong to different religions. they are one though their religions might be different and they have passed on these values to their children, including me"", haresh says. an otherwise communally sensitive society of bharuch has been appreciative of the patels and khanderaos. ""people are curious to know how a muslim family can live with a hindu family in the same house and share the same kitchen. we simply tell them that this is how it should be. all religion are equal and god is one, some call him allah and some ishwar"", says mumtaz. the patels and khanderaos had got together to share a common meal in their three-storeyed house on thursday. in stark difference, about two km from their house in panchbatti area and on the other side of narmada in ankleshwar, fanatics were setting shops on fire, sending up different kinds of flames.

"This story is from March 11, 2002  ahmedabad: union finance minister yashwant sinha has unwittingly given a gift to amdavadis. a gift that would help ahmedabad municipal corporation (amc) bridge the disparity of civic amenities between the eastern and western parts of the city. storm water drainage system, flyovers and better solid waste management would be the immediate benefits coming to citizens by the end of this year. the amc is now looking towards over-subscription of its rs 100-crore tax-free non-convertible debentures, which had been under a shadow since riots shattered peace in the city. the cause for this is that the finance minister has struck off tax-free debentures from the budgetary outlay for 2002-03. the result is that amc''s tax-free bonds that had been sanctioned in september, 2001, is now much in demand. the civic authority in its appeal to various banking and financial institutions has said: ""the proceeds of these redeemable and tax-free bonds will be used to part finance water supply augmentation scheme and setting up of sewage disposal and sanitation systems in the eastern areas of city. the present bond offers tax-free returns of nine per cent per annum semi-annually (payable on march 1 and september 1) for a 10-year tenure."" sources in amc disclosed that the union bank of india has already paid rs 25 crore (each bond is worth rs 1 lakh with minimum subscription of 10 debentures). both the state bank of saurashtra and the gujarat state finance corporation, too, have bought rs 5-crore worth of bonds each. the civic body expects another rs 10-crore worth of investment from the central bank of india. while for the investors, the bonds would translate into tax-free dividends, for the amc, the money would mean work on pending civic projects that would start from april, 2002. the non-convertible debentures have waited over a year now to reach this ''pink'' status. on march 2, 2001, amc''s standing committee had passed a resolution clearing issuance of rs 100-crore civic bond. the bond could not meet its target for completing all formalities by march 31. economic recession and non-conducive market conditions had further delayed the bond issue. next came an ""in financial doldrums"" status for the amc which had the incumbent municipal commissioner p panneervel putting the bond issue on hold. now with an elite tax-free status and a gradually improving financial condition, the amc feels time is right to go public and cash in when the investors are ready to spend in new financial year. way back in 1998, the amc had earned accolades as a trend-setter. it had earned a distinction of being the first municipal corporation in india to issue rs 100-crore worth of public bonds backed by an enviable aa(so) rating by crisil. this time too the civic body has become the first in the country to raise money through tax-free public bonds from large financial and commercial organisations. the municipal commissioner, p panneervel, told tnn: ""the response to these bonds is quite encouraging. already an investment of rs 45 crore has been made in the first couple of days after launching the bond. we hope to get enough investors within a short time."" he added, ""we are helped by the fact that the bond has got a unique status of being civic debentures that would give investors tax-free returns. we hope to reach the rs 100-crore mark soon enough to start implementing civic infrastructure strengthening projects by april, 2002. our aim is to have storm water drainage and sewerage pipeline network in place before the next monsoon. especially for areas under amc''s east municipal zonal office. the other areas of city (apart from the pipeline network) would be benefited by flyovers and bridges that would ease pressure on city''s thoroughfares."""	0	0	0	0	0

""since the situation is tense and the vhp-bajrang dal combine is threatening to construct a temple at the disputed site, there is a need for an elected government to handle affairs"", he said. he added, ""instead of allowing the caretaker government to continue, the president should keep the assembly under suspension till a new government is formed. people have no faith in the bjp led caretaker government headed by rajnath singh,"" he added. he urged chief minister s m krishna to take measures so that communal elements are under vigil in the state."	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 11, 2002  patiala: after a long period of seven years, smiles have returned on the faces of potato growers in punjab. the rate of the potato crop was decreasing every year and during last season in september-october 2000, the farmers, especially in the doaba region, were forced to throw their yield on the roads for which the police had registered cases against the farmers. in many other areas of the state the farmers had not gone to lift their bags kept in the stores as the rent of the stored crop was much higher than the market price of the yield and they were not in position to pay the rent of the stored yield. this year the situation is totally different. in the beginning of the present season in the last week of october 2001, the rate of fresh potatoes had gone up to rs 700 per bag and there was good demand of the yield in delhi, uttar pradesh and gujarat due to which most of the farmers started sending their entire yield to the mandis, disclosed amrik singh of raisal village. according to an estimate the farmers sent their fifty per cent of crop to the mandis in the early months of the season. however, the early crop was under blight disease in many areas of the state and the yield was less than the expectations but there was no loss to the farmers and many of them sold the entire crop even without sparing seed for the next year. however, the present market price of the potato is rs 275 per bag of 80 kg bag as compared to the last season''s price of rs 80 per bag, but at present the potato seed is being sold at the rate of rs 500 per bag. it is worth while to note that the rate of the crop is increasing day by day since the last week as the farmers have started storing their yield in hand in hope of more profit. on the other hand the cold storage owners are not in high spirit as they feel that the season would again not be fruitful for them. inderjit singh of ghundar cold store near amloh said that during the last season, they were not even paid the rent of the potato storage by the farmers and they were forced to sell them in the mandis at a throwaway price and after selling the stored yield in the mandis they could not get return even on their expenditures. however, in the last october, the market was high and the farmers got a good return of the stored yield but this market trend was going against them as most of the farmers had already sold their fresh yield in the market and had nothing to store in the cold storages, he said. inderjit further disclosed that under the present circumstances, their cold storages might end up utilising only half of their capacity.	0	0	1	0	0

"new delhi: former minister and eminent lawyer ram jethmalani added a piquant twist to the ayodhya tale on thursday, when he accused all governments since 1994 of failing to fully implement the supreme court verdict. seeking clarification in the rajya sabha on the prime minister's statement on the ayodhya issue, jethmalani asked who was responsible for ""dereliction of a duty"" cast by the farooqi judgement of 1994. the independent rajya sabha member pointed out that on pages 410 and 411, the farooqi judgement provided that while the ayodhya property could not be transferred till adjudication of the title suit, the embargo was only on the disputed area. jethmalani said that according to the verdict, the undisputed land, acquired for preserving law and order around the disputed site, did not come under this embargo. in fact, he said, the order clearly said that land beyond that necessary to preserve security around the disputed site, should be returned to the owners of the land. ""they told you to return the land which is not necessary. this should have been acted upon,"" he said. though all subsequent governments had failed to do this, the senior leader impressed upon the prime minister that if he had done this, a lot of trouble might have been averted.

"This story is from March 1, 2002  vadodara: with kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi kick-starting the female foeticide controversy, sahiyar, a city-based woman''s organisation has organised a unique competition of short story, play, songs and poetry writing on the theme of promoting the girl child and showing female foeticide in poor light. the competition would provide a counterpoint to what many ngos feel is the increasing incidence of popular serials showing women as subservient to men. the most blatant example was a recent episode of kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi, where a couple is congratulated after a sex-determination test predicts the foetus is male. the serial is reported to have been ''awarded'' the duryodhana award by an ngo in mumbai for its depiction of women in poor light. many activists are also worried because the statistics of the male-female ratio in gujarat is alarming. for children between 0 to 6 years the number of girls per 1000 boys is 878. there are 36.5 lakh boys and 32.11 lakh girls, the shortfall of girls to equal boys is almost 4 lakh informs trupti shah of sahiyar. ""another reason for organising this competition is to get people to start thinking on the issue of the girl child and the concept of female foeticide. most people do not think on these issues as it is not written about, as there is a lacunae of literature on female foeticide. ""this competition would give us an opportunity to tap the literary talent amongst the people and at the same time get them to think on these issues"" she said. according to her, the issue of female foeticide as a concept by itself is accepted in many parts of the country and specifically in gujarat too. ""even in this age, we have seen well-to-do families opting to kill the foetus when they find it to be a female. they go for illegal sex determination and this is proved in the decreasing female to male ratio. ""this is a dangerous trend, as in normal circumstances in any society it has been found that the number of women is more than the number of men. the lower number of girls indicates that selective killing of female foetus exists. this fact is backed by research too"", she says. in the country as a whole too, the number of women per 1000 men has decreased over the years. in 1901, for every 1000 men there were 972 women and this number has reduced in the current years to 933. in gujarat, the statistics are much worse for every 1000 men there are 919 women indicating that the craze for male heir has driven parents to kill the female foeticide. there is a need to increase awareness about this trend. in societies where the women are fewer in number, sexual abuse and rape too are common. the competition is open to all those who are above 13 years and groups too can participate by sending in joint entries. the age group of members in the group should range between 13 to 17, 18 to 21 and 22 above. the story word length should not be beyond 800 to 1000 words and for plays it should be between 1,500 to 3,000. the last date for entry is march 15. all entries should be sent to sahiyar at g 3 shivanjali flat, opposite navjivan post office, ajwa road. for more information contact on 513482.

"new delhi: the kanchi shankaracharya''s compromise formula is running into roadblocks already, with the vishwa hindu parishad clarifying on wednesday that it had not committed to abide by a court verdict in the ayodhya case, only assured that status quo would be maintained till the judgment.       read this story in...

""we have not given an undertaking that we will abide by any verdict of the court. we have only said in a written assurance that the status quo will be maintained at the disputed site,"" he said. kishore said he was quoting the exact statement in the written assurance given to the shankaracharya and signed by ram janmabhoomi trust president mahant ramchandradas paramhans. on a day when there were some positive developments like the centre moving the allahabad high court to expediate a verdict in the ayodhya case, and hectic parleys continued in the capital to find a workable solution, the vhp stand struck a discordant note. though vhp leaders have repeatedly said that they hope the kanchi seer - who is mediating in the dispute - will find a solution, they don''t seem to put too much in store by the formula he presented on tuesday. a senior leader said there was little hope of the latest proposal actually helping to arrive at a solution. there is also a fear that the all india muslim personal law board may approach court to get a stay on the vhp''s programme. the parishad also made clear on wednesday that rebuilding of the babri mosque at the disputed site would not be acceptable. ""it was and is and will remain a temple of ram lalla,"" kishore said. asked about vhp working president ashok singhal''s meeting on wednesday morning with the kanchi seer, kishore said ""nothing has been communicated yet as a final decision is expected only when the shankaracharya meets the prime minister today evening."" the seer stayed back an extra day in the capital to meet the prime minister again as well as some other politicians and leading lawyers to explore options for a solution to the ayodhya imbroglio. he also spoke to several imams and other muslim leaders. the vhp is dismissive of the muslim leadership participating in the talks, pointing out that there seems to be a lack of agreement among various factions. religious leaders like the shahi imam of the jama masjid in delhi have questioned the muslim law board''s authority in this regard. members of the board had met the shankaracharya on tuesday and have called an emergency meeting on march 10 to deliberate on his proposal. kishore was also dismissive about the shankaracharya of govardhan puri aadhog shajananda tirth, who attacked the vhp as ""anti-social elements"" here on wednesday. terming him a ""pretender"" and a ""self-proclaimed"" shankaracharya, kishore pointed out that the real seer of puri mutth was swami nischalananda. aadhog shajananada, he said, was not even recognised by the other shankaracharyas themselves. related stories A court petitioned to remove curbs on kar sevaksA muslim board threatens to pull outA centre moves hc to speed up ayodhya caseA kanchi seer postpones return homeA we agreed because pm was involved: muslim panel    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0

new delhi: terming kanchi shankaracharya''s initiative to resolve the ayodhya imbroglio as a sincere intention, former prime minister h d deve gowda on friday said the government should be more cautious in dealing with vhp in view of past the experience. ''''the government should take all steps to prevent vhp from not repeating the 1992 (when babri masjid was demolished) as they (vhp) had earlier also given an understanding before the supreme court and then violated it'''', gowda told reporters after addressing a gathering of muslim leaders at his residence here. he said it was all the more important as the political situation in uttar pradesh was not clear and it was the responsibility of the centre to act in a manner to maintain peace. gowda said that the coming together of spiritual leaders and leaders from the minority community to find a solution to the ayodhya issue was a welcome move. the former prime minister, who would be visiting ahmedabad for two days from tomorrow, demanded a judicial probe by a supreme court judge into the whole gamut of violent incidents in gujarat.

"This story is from March 6, 2002  gandhinagar: in a move which will only give ammunition to the opposition to expose the duplicity of the gujarat government in the riots over the last one week, the government has decided to give only rs 1 lakh as compensation to next of kin of persons who died in the bloody aftermath of the godhra train massacre. this is just half of what the next of kin of the deceased sabarmati express passengers will get. a government resolution (gr) on this was issued on tuesday after a top-level meeting chief minister narendra modi took with state revenue department officials. the congress has termed the decision as ""grossly discriminatory."" chief minister narendra modi had announced a compensation of rs 2 lakh to the 58 victims of the godhra train burning incident on february 27, hours after the incident took place. making the announcement in the state assembly, modi had termed the gruesome incident train burning act, in which women, children and kar sevaks were burnt alive, as an ""act of organised terrorism."" while the injured of the godhra train incident would be paid a compensation from rs 5,000 to rs 50,000, depending on the intensity of the injury, those injured in riots would be paid between rs 2,000 to rs 50,000. forty per cent of the death compensation in both the cases would be paid in cash, while for the rest would be paid as narmada shrinidhi bonds. ""the bonds would bear an interest rate of 10.75 per cent and would be free of the income tax clause 15-a"", a senior official said. the state, in the meanwhile, is yet to take a final decision on whether to pay a compensation to those whose houses have been gutted in the riots. ""we may decide payment up to rs 50,000 compensation"", a senior official said. already, the government has made it clear that the judicial inquiry which has been ordered into the godhra train massacre would not be extended to its bloody aftermath. if at all the government wants a separate inquiry commission for to probe the aftermath, it has not made its stand clear so far. the congress, in its memorandum submitted to the cm on saturday, asking him to for rs 5 lakh compensation and extend the same compensation to the communal flare-up victims all over the state. congress legislature party chief naresh raval said, ""one cannot discriminate the two set of victims like this. the compensation has to be the same for both. i am surprised."" raval insisted, ""if they cannot give rs 5 lakh to all, they should evenly give rs 2 lakh."" disagreeing with the argument, a senior government official told tnn, ""the godhra train incident victims have been treated at par with the victims of the of 1992-93 communal riots that had flared up in gujarat in the wake of the ayodhya incident. at that time, the state government had come up with a special government resolution (gr) increasing the amount payable to riot victims to rs 2 lakh from rs 1 lakh."""	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 5, 2002  hubli: this man has walked the streets of hell, and is now safe home. baba abbhanavar (25), who reached hubli on monday night, is yet to reconcile himself to the fact that he has escaped gujarat''s theatre of madness. the horror of communal frenzy haunts him as he recollects that a truck driver from nippani was tied to the steering wheel and set on fire. ``it was a miraculous escape for me, i watched as around 20 youths surrounded him baying for his blood. my truck was parked very close to a punjabi dhaba, about 12 km from ahmedabad. the dhaba owner pleaded with the fanatics not to burn the truck.'''' this gave baba his chance to escape. the truck was driven a small distance before it was set ablaze. ``i was hiding nearby when the group of youths targeted another parked truck. they wanted to know the driver''s religion and were not convinced as the name of the truck contradicted the driver''s claims.'''' he was begging for his life. but the youths took a rope, tied him to the steering and made him chant a slogan. even as he began, he was consumed by flames, baba recollects. at least 25 trucks from karnataka were burnt on gujarat''s highways. a shocked baba ran away and took shelter in another dhaba. he frantically called his relative in pendar oni in hubli for safe passage. congress leaders raja desai and siraj ahmed kudchivale contacted a merchant in ahmedabad, who in turn directed baba to reach acn food industry in dabbal chowki, about 62 km from ahmedabad. ``the 50-km walk was a trip through hell. a trail of destruction and death. miscreants settling ablaze vehicles, killing people.'''' the owner of the food industry played the role of good samaritan, helping baba board a train to pune from nadiad. baba is a chili merchant who sells his produce in gujarat. he left hubli, unaware that he would watch the dance of death up close, and also return a much poorer man. baba has lost his fortune of rs 4.32 lakh. a brother of six sisters, baba recently lost his father. life will not be the same, he says tearfully. congress leaders raja desai and kudchivale have petitioned chief minister s.m. krishna for compensation to baba. there were four persons in the truck along with baba. two persons who were missing are reportedly safe. baba returned home with truck cleaner muthya. ``what connection do i have with the sabarmati train tragedy or the ayodhya controversy? if god has created human beings, he must be a miserable god to create such fanatics.'''' baba is a bitter man today.	0	0	0	0	0
vadodara/rajkot: the violence that spread across gujarat following the attack on sabarmati expess in godhra also left in its wake loss of crores of rupees as industrial units in vadodara and rajkot were attacked on friday and factories and consignments set on fire. apart from setting on fire as many as five units in the industrial belt of halol, about 40 km from vadodara, a mob on friday also burnt a truck carrying 63 opel astra cars from the general motors factory in halol. lucky studio, owned by film producer sajid nadiadwala, was also gutted. while the loss incurred by the studio could not be ascertained, the loss to general motors is being pegged at over rs 4 crore. of the five industrial units that were set on fire, four were plastic factories and one engineering unit. the industrial town of halol remained tense as only 17 policemen were on duty in the town limits and they are unable to stop the rampaging the mobs from targetting the factories. the air in this town is thick with the smell of burning chemicals, especially after the plastic units were set ablaze. in rajkot, violence spread into industrial areas like aji, shapar-veraval and gidc industrial estate. as many as 25 small and medium industrial units were set ablaze by rampaging mobs in the aji industrial area alone. in the shapar-veraval area, units like suraj industries, nazeen industries, polymer packaging and antech television were damaged by the mobs. in the latiplot industrial area, about 15 units with stocks of wooden logs were set afire, causing a loss of about rs 5 crore. in the kevdawadi and gundawadi areas, units like bazuki industries and kirti packaging, which had large stocks of packaging material and cardboard, were torched. eye-witnesses said that the police deployment was inadequate in the face of the mob fury that unleashed terror in these areas.

"This story is from March 12, 2002  gandhinagar: bjp national president jana krishnamurthy has rejected the strong yearning of the state party leadership for holding early state assembly polls in gujarat, to take advantage of the communal polarisation after the recent riots. he told newspersons, soon after filing his nomination papers for the rajya sabha seat from gujarat, that the bjp would not like to take advantage of the situation. ""the situation does not demand fresh elections, the next assembly polls are scheduled only for february 2003,"" he said. a puzzled chief minister narendra modi sat by quietly, signalling to his party boss from new delhi to restrain himself from making such a statement. but an adamant krishnamurthy made it clear to all those who wanted an early poll that the bjp does not believe in taking advantage of ""such a situation"". he emphasised, ""i detest the very talk about an early poll in gujarat under such circumstances,"" adding, ""we don''t take political mileage from such an eventuality"". saying he did not have enough time to read reports as to in whose favour the popular sentiments have gone after the riots, krishnamurthy emphasised, ""i have visited ahmedabad city. what i can say is the state government''s effort to control the communal riots early should be appreciated. one can only draw a parallel with the 1984 anti-sikh riots in delhi, where more than 3,000 men, women and children had died, and the then prime minister justified it saying when a big tree falls, some commotion was bound to happen."" krishnamurthy said, ""even though all the law and order machinery was readily available then, the riots could not be controlled in delhi. however, here, within 24 hours, the law and order situation had improved."" agreeing that largest number of people had died during the recent riots than anyone that preceded, he added, ""it is, however, not a question of numbers. even if one person dies, it is a sad thing. the state government should now protect the people and ensure that such a thing does not happen in the society again"". referring to the view now widely being taken among large sections of intelligentsia and business circles that the state''s economy has been pushed back because of the communal disturbances, krishnamurthy said, ""gujaratis have enough stamina and resilience to come out of unhappy situations. it has the ability to quickly overcome disasters like drought, earthquake and communal riots. i want peace to return quickly in the state. the state government needs help from every quarter"". saying that rehabilitation should be the first priority for the government and non-government organisations, krishnamurthy said the government''s efforts in controlling the riots and healing the wounds will go a long way in contributing to the party''s electoral success in future. ""in the recent by-polls, we may not have got votes. but we must remember our past experience. we were just two mps in india in 1984 - one each from andhra pradesh and gujarat. today, we are the single largest party in the country,"" he said."	0	0	0	0	0

"new delhi: even as the vishwa hindu parishad is adamant on holding bhoomi pujan on the acquired land in ayodhya, the nda allies are looking at the prime minister and the supreme court to avert a political crisis, failing which they would have to take a final stand on either side of the line drawn by the sangh parivar. maybe at the cost of the government. the pace and determination with which the vhp moves towards the proposed bhoomi pujan (consecration of land for construction) for the temple, the allies have pinned their hopes on the supreme court. the apex court is scheduled to hear a contempt petition on wednesday against the vhp programme at the acquired site.the allies hope that if the court restrains the vhp, forcing the union government to stop the vhp programme, a political crisis that could push reluctant allies out of the government would be averted. for, they see this crisis as merely a sabotage from within the sangh parivar aimed at the pm. ""we fear that in the name of a symbolic bhoomi pujan, the vhp might carry a few carved pillars and establish that they have actually begun construction. in that case, we would be forced to pull out of the government,"" said a senior leader of an alliance partner. yet, there is considerable doubt within the nda about how far the allies would go against their compulsions of power politics. however, even the samata party now talks of ""an unforseeable sequence of events"" if the kar sevaks who have gathered in ayodhya are not dispersed. according to shambhu shrivastava, samata party spokesman, ""if it is not permitted by the supreme court or agreed upon by muslim community leaders, absolute status quo at the acquired site should not be altered even in the form of a symbolic puja. in no case a crowd of pilgrims or kar sevaks should be allowed to gather there, since that may lead to an unforseeable sequence of events."" the tdp, the dmk, the trinamul congress, the janata dal (u) and ram vilas paswan''s lok jana shakti have already made it clear that they would find it difficult to support the government if it allows construction of the temple.

This story is from March 3, 2002  politicians are to blame for the ever-increasing communalism in india. they seek votes in the name of caste and creed and add fuel to fire by provocative speeches. the two-party system will serve india better. anyone seeking votes in the name of caste or creed should be banned for ever. people should not be asked to identify their caste or religion in any kind of declaration, application and communication. uttam kumar, vasant kunj india can root out communalism only if it is able to root out terrorism. the terrorism which india has been facing for the last so many years is not a aEURoenatural terrorismaEUR born out of some injustice, but it is an aEURoeengineered terrorismaEUR which is targeted many times against one community. the very purpose of terrorists is to create and sustain communalism. it is the sacred duty of the government of the day to protect its citizens from terrorists. second, vote-bank politics of the present-day politicians does not provide any relief to the victims. a victim of communal violence doesnaEUR(tm)t need crocodile tears from politicians, but the real love of concerned people and neighbours, and the protective arm of the local administration. over the years, we have forgotten the divine quality of forgiveness. we tend to consider it a sign of weakness, not a sign of strength. we should know that to think of revenge is the first sign of weakness. we should create the feelings of forgiveness among our younger generation. a separate subject of aEUR~harmonyaEUR(tm) should be introduced in the primary and secondary classes. ashok gupta, bali nagar the issue of communalism has been present in our society since time immemorial. our country is ruled by politicians who give more importance to temples and mosques than human life. we should be broad in our thoughts and outlook. itaEUR(tm)s high time we stopped behaving like the 15th century people while living in the 21st century society. ankur datta, noida. when a person identifies himself too closely with his religion, he always thinks, aEUR~aEUR~my customs, my religion, my cultureaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) are better than otheraEUR(tm)s. it is high time our people shifted their focus from personal aggrandisement to the national interest. if a person thrives, he should thank people who made it possible and god. only when people abandon the single-minded pursuit of selfishness and keep the national interest foremost in thier minds, will we be successful in rooting out evils like communalism. who lives if india dies? archana gupta, bali nagar todayaEUR(tm)s politicians are myopic in their outlook. they practise politics based on caste and religion. communalism benefits only them, not the common man. put a stop to communal politics. let none be appeased. there should be no reservations in the name of caste or creed. if there is any reservation, let it be for backward regions to help people get basic amenities like food, water, power, transport and education. o.p. verma, rohini humanity is the first religion. ours is a land of gandhi who was the apostle of non-violence. we should practise what he preached. to root out communalism, we should ban all communal organisations such as the vhp, the rss, the shiv sena,and the ali sena. the need of the hour is to teach gandhism and secularism, not saffronise history. every human being has an innate desire to love. but this noble impulse is being stifled by our vile politicians and communal leaders. who is paying the price for their vile schemes: the common hindu and muslim. indiaaEUR(tm)s strength lies in unity, humanity, secularism and respect for all religions. mazhab nahi sikhata aapas main bair rakhna. live and let live. mohammed hamid saba, munirka the present crop of our politicians is rooted in vice, caste, communalism, and corruption. communalism is their ladder to political power. why wonaEUR(tm)t those who reap harvest by stoking communal fire lose any opportunity to fan it?

This story is from March 4, 2002  ahmedabad: communal violence in gujarat just refused to die down in several parts of the state and even though killings took a break there was no respite from the rioters and arsonists who took to the streets in several areas, including the cities of surat, bhavnagar and ahmedabad on sunday. police opened fire on riotous mobs in bhavnagar and surat which were setting fire to property and looting the goods. even though no new killings were reported on sunday, the death toll in the communal violence has climbed sharply to 430, according to the state police control room in gandhinagar, because of the recovery of many bodies in the towns and cities which were rocked by violence over the last five days.the official figure is expected to be revised to 470 by monday morning. news areas were engulfed in violence as morbi in rajkot district had to be brought under curfew following incidents of arson and looting. mobs set fire to shops and trucks on the highway in the ranika area of bhavnagar which continued to remain tense throughout the day. four companies of paramilitary forces have been rushed to bhavnagar. in ahmedabad mobs set on fire a scrap-yard and two other business establishments in the karanj area of the walled city from which at least nine persons were rescued. in surat, the three columns of the army which arrived on sunday morning, helped to arrest the fast deteriorating situation within the city but violence erupted in the outskirts of the city, particularly in pandesara, limabayat and near the causeway near rander. to disperse the mob at several places, the police fired over 50 rounds and over 100 persons have been arrested in combing operations at many places in the city, according to police commissioner v k gupta. earlier, the situation became worse in surat when an estimated 2000-strong mob gathered near the gujarat housing board society near pani ki tanki at pandesara on sunday morning and burnt down several shops.the police had difficulty reaching the troubled spot as the roads were blocked with wooden logs and bricks. police opened fire and lobbed teargas shells at the mobs but no casualties were reported till late in the evening.there was also a communal clash in deodhar town near palanpur where four persons were burnt alive and two persons were killed in police firing. curfew continued to be imposed, especially in sensitive areas like bardoli, as a precautionary measure, said superintendent of police (surat rural) k l n rao. curfew was relaxed for women and children for six hours. police officials said that nearly 2,537 persons have so far been rounded up in the state.	1	1	1	1	1
"new delhi: the wave of murders and arson attacks against muslims and their businesses in gujarat is a slap on the face of prime minister vajpayee, whose grossly understated appeal for calm after wednesdayaEUR(tm)s dastardly attack on train passengers in godhra has clearly not been heeded by the gujarat government. while the official inquiry will establish the extent to which the attack on the sabarmati express was premeditated, there can be no doubt about the planned nature of the violence directed against gujarataEUR(tm)s muslims on thursday. property worth crores was burned down by well-organised gangs, which went about their business in the knowledge that the police would do nothing. it was perhaps in anticipation of such a development that vajpayee cancelled his visit to australia. intimately familiar with gujarat cm narendra modiaEUR(tm)s reputation as a hardliner within the hindutva parivar, the pm knew he could not be counted upon to act as an efficient aEUR"" let alone even-handed aEUR"" administrator at a time like this. indeed, alarming signs were visible soon after wednesdayaEUR(tm)s carnage, when the pronouncements of senior gujarat ministers suggested restraint was the last thing on their minds. tragically, vajpayee has overestimated his capacity to enforce peace through verbal appeals and physical presence alone. he has failed to realise that he does not have the moral clout of mahatma gandhi aEUR"" and that only the exercise of the political and administrative powers he possesses can ensure that gujarat does not burn. when the vhp gave a call for a gujarat-wide bandh, both vajpayee and union home minister l k advani should have realised the incendiary implications. two years ago aEUR"" in august 2000 aEUR"" when the vhp gave a similar call after the killing of pilgrims in pahalgam in kashmir, sangh parivar activists torched muslim property worth crores in ahmedabad, surat, sabarkantha, palanpur and rajkot. in surat alone, muslim powerloom owners lost property worth rs 10 crore. unlike the august 2000 vhp bandh, the gujarat government this time did not formally endorse the extremist outfitaEUR(tm)s call. but the manner in which the state administration has facilitated aEUR"" through omission and, possibly, commission aEUR"" the anti-muslim violence of the vhp and bajrang dal activists makes the modi administration equally culpable. the physical targeting of muslims and their businesses by the sangh parivar is likely to have disastrous consequences for the country. with the vhp and kindred groups like the shiv sena anxious to milk the situation, violence can spread to other parts of the country. at a time when muslim indians are already feeling alienated and victimised, the carnage in gujarat will drive them to the wall.

"new delhi: there is no evidence yet of the isi''s involvement in the attack on sabarmati express in gujarat, say intelligence officials. defence minister george fernandes on tuesday blamed ""outside forces, including the isi"" for engendering the attack on the train. home minister l k advani, minister of state for home i d swamy, bjp president jana krishnamurthy and the spokesperson of the ministry of extenal affairs have in various forums talked of the role of the isi and the underworld in the riots in gujarat as well as the attack on the sabarmati express. however, unlike the december attack on parliament or the attack on the american center in kolkata where the involvement of international terrorist organisations was proved beyond doubt, there is no concrete evidence yet to link the gujarat violence to outside forces, say intelligence officials. minister of state omar abdullah quickly withdrew his statement that the riots were due to ""local factors"" and later issued a clarification that his utterances were in a personal and not official capacity. there were reports from kolkata that some terrorists linked to the gujarat carnage had been arrested, but the reports were denied by the government. coincidentally, underworld don aftab ansari who was deported from the uae recently is currently held by the gujarat police, and according to sources, did not know about the attack. intelligence sources here say that while there are several indications that the attack on the sabarmati express was pre-medidated, they have nothing to link it to the isi and the underworld. indeed, some officials privately admit that the government trying to play the ""foreign hand"" may be an attempt to shield itself. further, say sources, the isi itself is not the force it used to be, given the recent purge in the agency carried out by pakistani president pervez musharraf. the isi is also reportedly starved for funds, with most underworld dons who financed its activities now shying away from the organistion. the pakistan government too has reportedly cut financial support, given the huge expenditure being incurred for the deployment of forces along the indian border.

This story is from March 9, 2002  mumbai: following its debacle in the recently concluded zilla parishad polls, the congress-led democratic front government seems to be losing its political will to push through a scheme to reform the milk purchase scheme in the state. for the second time now, the state government has decided to put on hold its decision to ask milk cooperatives to sell at least 20 per cent of their milk collection locally.the decision, taken last year, was to be put into effect from january 1 this year.it was then postponed to march 1. now, says dairy development commissioner, m. rameshkumar, the government has decided to give some more time to the milk cooperatives till may 1.aEURoethe milk cooperatives have made representations to say that they need time to put the infrastructure in place to sell milk in thier areas,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he said. according to sources, the government has developed cold feet following the congressaEUR(tm) poor showing at the polls. it does not want to antagonise the milk producers any further for fear of losing a votebank. also, cooperatives in the state form a powerful political lobby, who have been asserting their say in their own governance. maharashtra is probably the only state where the government plays an active role in the dairy sector. as of now, the government is committed to purchasing all the milk that is sold to it by the cooperative unions. it buys 16.5 lakh litres of milk every day from about 65 unions, which causes a loss of about rs 200 crore per year. about 4.5 lakh litres of milk procured daily is surplus, and is converted into butter and milk powder. the conversion costs a total loss of rs 5 per litre. for 2001-02, the government has produced 17,000 tonnes of powder and 13,000 tonnes of butter, of which about 3,000 tonnes in each case remains unsold. aEURoethis vast stock ends up depressing the market, driving the government further into the red,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) observes an official. dairy experts say there is simply no escape from encouraging local consumption of milk since exports from the country are too low today at 0.1 per cent to make much of a difference if they are increased. aEURoeexports cannot grow exponentially but local sales can,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says an expert. the co-operative model in maharashtra does not work the same way as that in gujarat.while the gujarat cooperatives have grouped themselves under amul, which is manned entirely by milk producers, cooperatives in maharashtra are controlled by politicians.aEURoe their politicisation has weakened their performance; there is lack of accountability, and absence of a vision for growth,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says an analyst. this in turn affects the well-being of the farmer. though a producer gets a higher price in maharashtra than he does in gujarat, he receives no benefits from his cooperative. in the amul model, the farmer gets a share in all the profits made through sales and investments by the company.while a gujarat milk producer gets rs 8.18 per litre on an average from the cooperative, a milk producer in maharashtra gets an average of rs 9 per litre. further, the average cost of handling is higher here. in gujarat, it is about 75 paise per litre and in maharashtra, it is about rs 1.15 per litre.	0	0	0	0	0

"This story is from March 4, 2002  ahmedabad: the traditional trouble spots of disturbances in the walled city area of ahmedabad are surprisingly quiet as the fringes of the city are emerging as the new communal hot-spots. it is remarkable, police officials say, that thickly-populated areas like kalupur, dariapur, jamalpur and raipur and khadia have remained relatively trouble-free this time accounting for only 6 out of a over 300 deaths that have taken place in ahmedabad over the last four days. the bulk of the killings have taken place in meghaninagar, naroda, odhav, amraiwadi and gomtipur. and the reasons are not far to seek. while the communally-volatile walled city areas have sizeable population of both the communities sharing space, there is also mutual respect for each others'' strengths, than in areas where one or the other community is hopelessly outnumbered and targeting them was easy for the mobs. surprisingly, even as pitched battles were on in fringe areas of gomtipur and naroda, the womenfolk were busy buying vegetables and fruits in manek chowk in the hub of the city. for the first time perhaps in the history of communal flare-ups of ahmedabad, it is not the walled city areas which are in the news for all the wrong reasons. officials say it could also be ''riot fatigue'' as the residents of the walled city have suffered the worst consequences of riots and therefore they have preferred to remain away from perpetuation of violence. when commissioner of police p c pandey was asked for his reaction on the phenomenon, he quipped, ""thank god that the walled city remained quiet this time."" he admitted that the situation would have taken a serious turn had trouble sparked off inside the walled city. in 1969, 1983, 1985 and 1992 the focus of attention were areas like kalupur, dariapur, jamalpur and the worst-hit raipur and khadia, which have earned the dubious distinction for violence since british days. the bouts of communal orgy in ahmedabad has its roots in the local problem of rath yatra taken out from the famous jagdish temple in jamalpur area of the walled city. the first major disturbance was reported in 1946 when ugly clashes took place between two communities when the rath yatra was passing through sensitive areas. according to sources, the large-scale communal riots had started following tiffs over annual the rath yatra procession only, except in 1992 when trouble erupted after the demolition of the babri mosque. and this is perhaps for the second time that riots were triggered off during the gujarat bandh call by vishva hindu parishad to protest against the killing of ram sevaks aboard sabarmati express while returning from ayodhya. unfortunately, despite frequent communal riots the state administration has not bothered to implement the recommendations made by two inquiry commissions, one appointed after the 1969 riots and then after the 1985 riots. the reports submitted by the reddy and dave commissions have been shelved and none of their findings and suggestions have been accepted or implemented so far. ""neither the congress nor the bjp regime have taken pains to study the recommendations made by these commissions to check the communal disturbances in ahmedabad,"" a senior minister said on condition of anonymity."	0	0	1	1	0

"This story is from March 1, 2002  ahmedabad: besides being the birthplace of the zealot mughal emperor aurangzeb, the twin towns of dahod and godhra have always been known for the religious divide that runs deep between communities and even within them. and had the police taken serious note of a clash between groups of muslims in dahod''s neighbouring town in december 2001, perhaps it would not have been caught totally unawares by wednesday''s macabre attack on the sabarmati express. while godhra has always been a flash-point of clashes between hindus and muslims, it is also witnessing an intensive struggle for supremacy between radical and moderate sections of the muslim community. in early december, followers of the moderate ahil-e-sunnat, an offspring of the barelvi islamic school, clashed with members of the radical tableeq jamaat after their differences over islamic tenets came to a boil. the rioting led to a lot of violence in which some shops and vehicles belonging to both the groups were torched. a dozen persons from both the sides were injured as the groups clashed with lathis and swords and pelted stones on each other for almost two hours before the police burst tear-gas shells to disperse the mob. the police arrested 72 persons from both the groups after they registered complaints of loot and plunder against each other. the incident followed a month after the local police warned a group of muslim boys belonging to tableeq jamaat against dressing themselves like osama bin laden. the problem started when two tableeq jamaat preachers from kashmir landed up at the noor mosque of the sunnat and started collecting donations during the month of ramzaan. the actual clash began when the duo insisted that they would sleep at the mosque against the instructions of the sunnat. in its seven mosques in dahod, a town of 1.20 lakh population, the sunnat has put up boards saying: ""outsiders shouldn''t come to the mosque. delivering provocative speeches is strictly prohibited."" the sunnat was forced to put up the instruction after it found that the tableeq preachers from outside dahod were coming to the sunnat mosques and delivering provocative speeches based on radical interpretation of islam and trying to hijack the sunnat followers to the tableeq fold. the barelvi school, from which the sunnat has sprung, has always stood for dargah worship and urs celebrations (fetes in memory of sufi saints), thus believing in the spiritualism of muslim saints. while the tableeqis, who are for puritanical salafi brand of islam, equate dargah worship with idol worship. sunnat leaders, some of whom are familiar faces during hindu religious festivals in dahod, say the tableeqis spread hatred in the society through their ideology. osama bin laden is a hero for them. in mid-2001, tableeqis disturbed a moharram procession. the stand-off between the two groups began in 1981 when the tableeqis objected to the sunnat maulvi reading the annual id namaaz at the local idgah. but the sunnat spurned the tableeqis. as a result, the local collector stepped in and took control of the idgah. since that day the idgah is locked, a tribute to the rivalry between the two groups. interestingly, the two outside tableeqi activists, who, according to the sunnat, were kashmiris, fled the town as soon as trouble began in december. police now believe that they were probably isi agents and there could be more of them still around. the attack on sabarmati express, it is now learnt, originated from a rumour in dahod that the passengers had attacked a mosque. by the time the train reached godhra, 40 minutes away, the mob was ready to pounce on the train. needless to say, there is a very large section of the minority community in godhra and other parts of gujarat who would be as upset with the attack on the train as the vhp volunteers."	0	1	1	1	1

ahmedabad: giving a clean chit to gujarat government, home minister l k advani on sunday rejected the demand for handing over the state''s commercial capital to the army as three days of communal frenzy showed signs of abating except stray arson, looting and police firing. advani also denied that the police played a passive role in the communal riots in ahmedabad and other places since they had resorted to effective firing to check the violence that had erupted in the wake of an attack on the sabarmati express in godhra last wednesday.  the army was also rushed in the next 24 hours to assist the local administration. referring to the opposition demand that the state should be handed over to the army, he said it was an irresponsible statement particularly when the army has been positioned to protect the borders.  addressing a crowded news conference after his visit to the scene of the railway tragedy in godhra as well as violence-affected areas of ahmedabad, advani said 77 deaths due to police firing had been reported from several parts of the state so far.  advani joined prime minister atal behari vajpayee in condemning communal violence and said: ``it was definitely a blot on the nation.'''' the communal flare-up in gujarat spoilt the good track record of the coalition government at the centre, he said.  asked whether the godhra train tragedy was premeditated, he said: ``it seemed premeditated.'''' as per his information based on a visit to the godhra railway station and discussions with the officials, ``it was certain that there were some other elements behind the incident''''.  the state government has already ordered a judicial probe to ascertain the facts of the gruesome incident and therefore it was not proper for him to comment on whether anti-national elements were involved in it, he added.  he said state officials had told him in godhra that at least four councillors of the godhra municipality had been arrested along with some 80 persons in connection with the attack on the sabarmati express. he was not aware of their party affiliations, he said adding that the inquiry report would reveal the truth.  he, however, maintained that the godhra incident and the riots should not be linked.  chief minister narendra modi, who was also present, said the state government would consider conducting an inquiry into the communal riots in various parts of gujarat.  the union home minister condemned the incidents in ahmedabad, including the one in which former congress mp ehsaan jaffri and his family members were killed. ``this kind of communal violence would send out wrong signals when concerted efforts were being made to crush terrorism from across the border and other parts of the world,'''' he said.  he said the law and order situation had improved after the deployment of the army and expressed the confidence that both the army and police would help restore normalcy.  he also said that the state government had assured him that the administration would make all-out efforts not only to restore peace but protect each and every citizen irrespective of his caste or creed and also deal firmly with the ongoing communal frenzy.  the people should extend support to the massive efforts being made by the government in this direction. local peace committees should organise meetings to restore order and communal harmony in the violence-affected areas.

"journalists constantly wring their hands over the growing criminalisation of politics, and call on political parties to choose better candidates. such moral lecturing is vacuous. criminals are not entering politics because of some inexplicable moral lapse by candidate selection committees, but because they have huge incentives to get in. to get them out, we must change the incentive system. many laws need changing, but one single change can have a huge impact. let the law provide that criminal cases against legislators will be heard before all others on a day-by-day basis to ensure a quick verdict. in one stroke, that will create a huge disincentive for criminals to contest elections. many will resign from the legislatures to escape the consequences. today, criminals join politics to gain influence and ensure that cases against them are dropped or not proceeded with. the law disqualifies convicted criminals from fighting elections. but this does not keep criminals out of politics because legal delays, often abetted by political pressures, make convictions of resourceful crooks rather rare. criminals threaten witnesses with death, and the feeble state cannot protect them. so we need a radical change. i wonder why public pressure for such change is not greater. our standards have dropped so far that we no longer realise how outrageous our situation is by international standards. when i tell foreigners that our legislatures are full of bandits, they smile incredulously. surely you mean, they say, that bandits assist your legislators? no, i insist, the bandits are the legislators. at which point the foreigners look appalled and foxed: they cannot understand how this can be so in what claims to be the worldaEUR(tm)s biggest democracy. a casual look at last weekaEUR(tm)s events shows how commonplace is the mixing of crime and politics. exhibit 1: the gujarat police say the man behind the godhra massacre was a local muslim politician, a feared don. exhibit 2: mansoor ahmed, samajwadi party mla, was shot at a public meeting. his family says the killing was staged by a political rival, tanveer ahmed, who was denied the samajwadi ticket and so contested, unsuccessfully, on the bsp ticket. gang killings and political killings are becoming indistinguishable. exhibit 3: ram sewak gautam, a policeman who had the temerity to raid the premises of don-cum-politician dp yadav and track down his son vikasaEUR""who is accused of murderaEUR""was transferred in the middle of the murder case. most newspapers ignored this. it is no longer news that officials seeking to catch political criminals get sidelined. look further beyond last week to the up assembly elections. according to india today, 965 of the 5,539 candidates who contested the up elections had criminal records. that is a whopping 17 per cent of all candidates. why are political parties so happy to adopt criminals as candidates? to understand the answer, recall max weberaEUR(tm)s definition of the state as the only entity that can use force with impunity. the rule of law is supposed to ensure that anybody else who uses force is jailed. but in india, a weak police and legal system ensures that mafia dons get away with murder. they can use force with impunity. so, a la weber, the mafia have as much legitimacy, in practice if not in theory, as the state. a criminal who can collect protection money is as powerful as an official tax-collector. a don who can use force to settle disputes is actually superior to the state, which is unable to settle disputes because of legal delays. a criminal candidate who can capture and stuff ballot boxes is, in our twisted democracy, on par with a popular politician who wins every vote. normally officials will report booth capturing, but not if the capturing don can credibly threaten them with death. besides, dons have lots of money, which is very useful for fighting expensive election campaigns. india has no system of public funding to enable honest people to meet election costs. black money is needed in hoards, and here criminals have a huge comparative advantage. in the up election, mayawati auctioned several candidatures to the highest bidder. so, according to reports, did the samajwadi party. obviously, criminals will get the better of honest folk in such auctions. why do dons invest large sums in getting tickets? because a ticket to the assembly is a ticket to kickbacks and extortion using political power. since the legal system no longer penalises theft, politicians who steal have a comparative advantage over others. returns on political investments are so high that criminals are disinclined to invest in tax-free rbi bonds. politics is so much more profitable, and just as tax-free. so, our system has unwittingly created huge incentives for criminals to enter politics. in the long run, we must clean up the legal and police system. meanwhile, we need quick steps to change the incentive structure. one is to provide public funding for elections. that will reduce the comparative advantage of criminals, and increase that of honest candidates. the second is to have a blanket ban on defections, a major source of political profit. any legislator who defects or disobeys the party whip in a vote of confidence should be forced to go back to voters for election on a new election symbol. those who split a party should go back to voters too. that will restore some meaning to representative government. but the most far-reaching measure, surely, will be to give automatic seniority to cases against legislators, which should be heard on a day-by-day basis. atal behari vajpayee, you need to find a new way of reviving the sagging fortunes of your party. why not try to seize the high moral ground by introducing a bill to prosecute criminal legislators quickly? your law minister, arun jaitley, will surely comply. true, such a law will be dismaying for mafia dons in your own party. but other parties have even more of them, and will suffer even more. what are you waiting for?

"This story is from March 10, 2002  mumbai: to the cynical eye, it seems like a careful-ly choreographed moment from a film on communal harmony. enveloped in a beige burkha, afsaar jaan sits on the church pew clutching a drowsy toddler. her neighbour shanta shinde waits expectantly for the service to begin, while at the other end of the wooden bench, maria pereira pores over a tiny prayer book. the harmonium emits a warning croak, the crowded church gets onto its feet and launches into a melodious hindi hymn, aEURoehey, pavitra aasman..aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) for a country struggling to emerge from

"new delhi: in a significant development, the vhp on friday said it was willing to consider postponing its temple construction plan from march 15 if the government or rss gives it a written assurance that worshipping of pillars would be allowed in the acquired land in ayodhya within three months. rss chief k s sudarshan and vhp''s international working president ashok singhal held hectic parleys till late thursday night. during the talks, singhal is believed to have expressed his inclination to tone down the vhp stand provided the centre give some assurance to the hindu religious leaders regarding a solution to the ram temple issue at the earliest, sangh sources said. according to the sources, singh told sangh leaders that it would be extremely embarrassing for the vhp to call off its on-going stir in ayodhya in response to prime minister atal bihari vajpayee''s appeal ""after having built-up momentum over the past several months"". sangh leaders on their part tried to convince singhal that nothing should be done which could put the bjp-led nda government in trouble. the meeting came after vajpayee sought rss intervention to sort out the impasse in the wake of mounting tension in ayodhya, the godhra killings and subsequent violence in gujarat. related stories:A overnight massacre takes death toll to 158A oppn seeks modi''s dismissalA vhp bandh partially affects mumbaiA tight security in ayodhyaA vhp may tone down stand on templeA give protection to kar sevaks: shiv senaA capital peaceful    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0
"This story is from March 3, 2002  thiruvananthapuram: the sparring motions of the vishwa hindu parishad do not worry the bjp. ""the vajpayee government will complete its term in spite of a militant vhp,"" remarked the bjp kerala chief c.k. padmanabhan. asked the rationale of his optimism, the party leader alluded to ""new allies"" coming to the bjp''s help. his reference is interpreted as the recent overtures of the aiadmk to the nda government. the bjp president said at a press conference on saturday that his party believed the vhp must exercise more restraint and patience. ""whoever believes that might is right will not succeed,"" he said in obvious reference to the vhp. padmanabhan said the political dialogue between hindus and muslims or a court verdict was the only way out in ayodhya. according to him a vast majority of muslims had no objection to building a temple in ayodhya. it is only an adamant group of community leaders and politicians blocking a peaceful solution. responding to a query why the centre was dragging its feet on such potentially inflammable issue, the bjp leader said the old and complex problems demand longer time to solve. the bjp leader has also alleged a conspiracy in the recent devastating fire in the sabarimala forests. he has demanded a judicial probe into the fire as valuables trees were cut and carted off much before the fire really engulfed the forests."	0	0	0	0	0
"This story is from March 5, 2002  ahmedabad: kutchis always feel they are distinct from gujaratis . their language is different and their culture is distinct from mainland gujarat. in fact, this is also the reason for a simmering demand for statehood in kutch which has never taken any serious shape. but if events unfolding over the last week have shown anything , kutchis are distinct from gujaratis even in their thinking. this vast district having the biggest percentage of muslim population (almost 35 per cent), has remained an island of peace in this ocean of violence that gujarat has turned into. the district has remained quit even as widespread violence broke out in neighbouring banaskantha, rajkot and surendranagar districts. was it the earthquake and the fact that many people are still piecing their lives together, or the traditional amity between the two communities, or the special efforts that the district police and administration made after last wednesday''s train massacre that were responsible for keeping the district''s peaceful record unblemished? perhaps , all three factors contributed to what has come out as a shining example of peaceful co-existence amidst grave provocation. and it is not that the district was entirely incident-free also. a mosque was damaged in nakatrana in a well-orchestrated move aimed at provocation. but following intervention by the police, the hindus of the locality have agreed to rebuild the place of worship and undo the damage. two persons were stabbed and injured in the same place and the police acted swiftly to arrest a local vhp activist, vasant patel. apart from that, there was an incident of arson in mandvi town which was quickly contained and prevented from spreading. says dr shyamsunder, a prominent physician who runs an ngo for the quake victims, ""by and large there is complete communal harmony in kutch compared to other places in gujarat, besides, having gone through the earthquake where hindus and muslims tried to help each other and are still in the process of rebuilding their lives, they certainly didn''t want to create a new problem for themselves"". the doctor says anjar town had witnessed a communal incident in 1970 and has been quiet ever since. officials however say the fact that kutchis are peaceful and secular, comparatively speaking, did help but special efforts were made as soon as news of the godhra incident trickled in. for example, official-level talks were held with the muslim leaders who were clearly upset with the attack on the train. the leaders were then encouraged to issue press statements expressing grief at the incident and announcing that they would voluntarily down their shutters the next day , not in support of the vhp sponsored bandh, but as a mark of solidarity to those who died in the tragegy. these statements were widely carried in the local newspapers. apart from this, the army was requested to move some of its forces inwards from the border on thursday during the bandh. as a result, 5 companies of the border wing of home guards and one company of border security force were stationed in and around bhuj. ""we had anticipated something would happen because the hindus were naturally very upset over godhra, but right from day one it was made clear that the security forces would brook no nonsense"", said superintendent of police vivek shrivastava. he said using his powers under the bombay police act, he had given police powers to the sarpanchs and the revenue officers to make arrests if there was any trouble. kutch collector harsh chibber said ""i have served in many districts of gujarat and i find that the harmony in the society is at a very different level in kutch than in other districts"". this, he said, was first in evidence during the earthquake when hindus helped the muslims and vice versa in all the localities with mixed population. ""maybe there are a lot of lessons to be learnt from kutch not only in how the human spirit can triumph over nature''s fury but how mutual respect and faith can be built between communities"", chibber said."	0	1	1	0	0

new delhi: the reported move to impose president''s rule in uttar pradesh, gujarat riots and killing of a samajwadi party mla in lucknow rocked lok sabha on thursday as agitated sp and rjd members stormed the well forcing adjournment of the house until friday. as soon as the lok sabha assembled after a two-day break as a mark of respect to the memory of speaker g m c balayogi, who was killed in a helicopter crash on sunday, opposition members were on their feet protesting government''s mishandling of the situation in gujarat and uttar pradesh. agitated samajwadi party members protested the reported recommendation by uttar pradesh governor vishnu kant shastri to the centre to impose president''s rule in the state. deputy speaker p m sayeed, who was in the chair, pacified members for a short while to allow two newly elected members to take oath and make obituary reference to two former members, ahsan jafri who was killed when a mob set fire to his house in ahmedabad on february 28, and jagdish narain mandal. bedlam in rajya sabha: ayodhya issue and gujarat killings rocked rajya sabha as a determined opposition stalled question hour demanding immediate discussion leading to adjournment of the house until friday without transacting any business. soon after the house assembled after two days of break to mourn the death of lok sabha speaker g m c balayogi, there was pandemonium with opposition members vociferously demanding suspension of question hour to take up burning issues. while some agitated members demanded action against those involved in gujarat killings, samajwadi party members, including amar singh, sought to raise the murder of their party mla outside raj bhavan in lucknow on wednesday and governor''s proposal for imposition of president''s rule in uttar pradesh. several other members wanted to raise the ayodhya issue leading to shouts and counter-shouts from ruling and opposition benches. as noisy scenes persisted for over 30 minutes, chairman krishan kant adjourned the house initially at 1200 hours. the house reassembled only to be adjourned again till 1400 hours. related stories A bsp will try to form up govt, says mayawatiA mulayam lashes out at up governorA governor proposes central rule for up    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail	0	0	0	0	0
new delhi: despite it becoming immediately apparent that the gujarat police was simply not acting to put an end to the communal disturbances which broke out throughout the state thursday morning, the state government and the centre made little effort to deploy central forces. it was only by friday noon, more than 50 hours after the ghastly godhra train incident, that the army could finally be deployed in ahmedabad and three other towns to quell the carnage unleashed in gujarat. who is to blame for this delayed induction? the army says it aEUR~aEUR~reacted as fast as possibleaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) once it got the orders to move. troops from aEUR~aEUR~reserve formationsaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) in the southern command area had to be airlifted by il-76 planes to gujarat because the formations normally based there, a division in ahmedabad and a brigade in gandhinagar, are part of the forward deployment along the indo-pak border. aEUR~aEUR~no troops were withdrawn from the border,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) said a defence official. aEUR~aEUR~troops from the southern command area began to reach ahmedabad on thursday night itself. but to move into an unknown territory, reconnaissance, communications and transportation facilities are required...this takes some time,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he added. then, apart from the apparent delay in requisitioning the army, the state government did not reportedly provide aEUR~aEUR~sufficient logistical support in timeaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). so, it was only after 11 am on friday that the army could stage its first flag-march in ahmedabad, as also fan out to vadodara, rajkot and godhra. as of now, say officials, two army brigades, with a aEUR~aEUR~bayonet strength of around 2,000 soldiers eachaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm), will be placed at the disposal of the civil administration. while one brigade is already positioned in the strife-torn state, the second is expected to begin deploying by friday night. at present, nine columns (70-100 soldiers each) of the army have been deployed in ahmedabad, while another three columns are present in vadodara, rajkot and godhra. as for the rapid action force (raf), which was created especially to quell riots speedily, it was deployed soon after the godhra carnage on wednesday. however, the state government appears to have taken its own time in putting it to use. raf sources here told the times of india that four companies of the force have been deployed at ahmedabad, godhra, surat and vadodra. asked why the raf was not deployed earlier, a senior official said, aEUR~aEUR~we are ordered to be deployed only when such incidents happen. and once we are there it is up to the state administration how they use us.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) (with inputs from bisheshwar mishra)    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail	0	0	1	1	0
This story is from March 13, 2002  lucknow: flouting all judicial norms, the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) leaders have created a political crisis in the nation by insisting on performing the symbolic puja near the disputed site in ayodhya. this was stated by up congress committee president sri prakash jaiswal. terming the move as dangerous and unfortunate, jaiswal said that after the heart-rending violence and arson in gujarat following the godhra incident, the communal forces were again trying to stoke large-scale violence and create a communal frenzy in the country. lamenting the loss of innocent human lives and destruction of property worth crores of rupees in gujarat, the congress leader said questions were being asked in foreign newspapers whether india was a modern, civilised and secular country. lambasting the sangh parivar, jaiswal said the manner in which it was challenging the jurisdiction of the apex court was a matter of concern for the entire nation. he has appealed to peace loving and secular-minded people to maintain communal harmony and frustrate the nefarious designs of communal forces.	0	0	0	0	0
"vadodara: at least 30 persons were burnt alive in pandarvada village of khanpur taluka of godhra district on friday afternoon when the whole village was set on fire by a group of miscreants. the incident took place about about 50 km from godhra where the attack on sabarmati express took place on wednesday. collector of godhra jayanti ravi, confirming the incident, said that the miscreants had apparently come from the neighbouring kheda district in a commercial vehicle. the residents of pandarvada were caught unawares as the armed assailants told them to huddle together and set the entire village ablaze. about 50 families inhabit the village which is located on the border with kheda district in central gujarat. the collector informed that the toll could go higher.

"new delhi: the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp), desperately looking for a face-saver, now only wants permission for a ""token"" ceremony at the so-called undisputed land in ayodhya on march 15. it has already diluted its earlier stand on beginning construction of the ram temple, and said it will give the government time till june 2 - when its 100-day yagna ends - to hand over the acquired land so that it can announce a date for temple construction. on monday, vhp and ramjanambhoomi nyas (rjn) leaders met swami jayendra saraswathi, the shankaracharya of kanchipuram, who is in the capital, to seek his cooperation in putting across their views to the government. indeed, the shankaracharya, who was scheduled to meet the prime minister on monday evening, has replaced the rss as the mediator between the vhp and the government. he will also meet senior muslim leaders on tuesday morning. the rjn, in a statement on monday, asked for the lifting of curbs on kar sevaks'' travel to ayodhya and removal of additional police forces from the site. it also sought permission for the march 15 ceremony and handing over of the acquired land in the custody of the centre by june 2. if these conditions were not agreed to by march 12, it threatened that kar sevaks around the country would travel to ayodhya and court arrest, if necassary. but it was clear from the more than hour-long news conference jointly held by the vhp and sants here, at which confusion prevailed with each speaker contradicting himself as well as the others, that they would retract if a ""token"" ceremony was permitted on march 15. publicly, they all said there was no question of going back on their determination to hold the ceremony of taking the carved pillars to the acquired land site on march 15 or else court arrest, and that the kar sevaks would continue to travel to ayodhya. but privately, senior vhp leaders said the doors for negotiations with the government were still open. it appeared that they would scale down the march 15 ceremony if the government agreed to hand over the land before june 2. the only difference is that the sants said the assurance from the government would have to be in writing because the pm had gone back on the verbal assurance he had made last year that the ayodhya issue would be resolved before march 12. both swami awaidhnath and mahant ramvilas vedanti stressed that the pm had gone back on his promise.

"ayodhya: where is the much-talked about shila (carved stone) which ram janambhoomi nyas president ramchandra das paramhans plans to ''donate'' to ""ram lalla"" through the government receiver (divisional commissioner)? paramhans, while stating that the shila has been selected, refuses to reveal where it has been kept or its description. ""i will not tell you where it has been kept or what are its specifications as it may alert the enemy. you can see it when i take it for donating,"" he said. however, sources in the vhp said that the stone is five feet in length, one-and-a-half feet in width and six inches deep. the stone, with fine carving on one side, has no images of any deity and is proposed to be used as the base, they said. interestingly, as the authorities have laid a virtual siege on the karyashala (workshop where the shilas are being carved) to prevent the shifting of the stones to the undisputed site, the shila in question has already been moved out to ""another location."" ""a puja is being conducted on the shila and it will be moved directly on march 15,"" the sources said. the shila has been purchased from rajasthan, they said. ask paramhans how he would take the shila as it is expected to have quite a weight, he keeps you guessing on that too. however, whether the shila will actually be ""donated"" or not will be clear on march 15 only as the administration is determined not to allow any movement of shilas. paramhans announced on monday to ""donate"" the shila to lord rama claiming that it had been instructed to him by the god himself by appearing in his dream the previous night. he said he would ""donate"" the stone in the same way as others donated money or jewellery for use in construction of the proposed ram temple. divisional commissioner a k gupta, who is the government receiver, has refused to accept the ""donation"", saying he would do it only after getting a nod from the centre.

""the bjp should send result-oriented members from gujarat and not those who have no knowledge of the state problems,"" he said. thus, in the backdrop of the note submitted by jaitley, the party is likely to adopt a cautious approach while selecting candidates for the crucial election. it is believed that the party may recommend the proposal of former finance minister vajubhai vala, who vacated his assembly seat for chief minister narendra modi and facilitated his entry into vidhan sabha. the request for vala has come from rajkot unit of the bjp. a delegation from the kutch district bjp unit has urged state bjp president rajendrasinh rana that either anant dave should be renominated or a senior party worker from the region should be chosen as a candidate in the election so that he could be used as a link between the state and the centre for the massive rehabilitation in the quake-hit kutch. the prominent names shortlisted so far include that of auda chairman surendra patel, state planning board chairman sooryakant acharya, state khadi and cottage industries board chairman jayantilal barot and that of kanaksinh mangrola. both vala and surendra patel could emerge as consensus candidates in the party forum while the third name was not yet certain. a senior rss leader from rajkot, pravin maniar, is also active suggesting names of some senior party workers from saurashtra region. the fourth seat falling vacant from gujarat is that of senior congress leader brahmakumar bhatt, whose term also expires along with the three bjp members. it is learnt that the gujarat pradesh congress committee (gpcc) is likely to recommend former union minister madhavsinh solanki for rajya sabha."	0	0	0	0	0

"new delhi: the immediate ayodhya standoff seems close to a settlement, with the vhp- armed with an assurance from the centre - indicating that it will perform only a symbolic puja of one carved stone on march 15. continuing its climb down, the parishad indicated on friday that it would perform only a symbolic puja as promised by the mediator, the shankaracharya of kanchi, sri jayendra saraswathi. the government, senior parishad leaders said, had given an assurance on wednesday night that permission of puja would be granted and restrictions imposed on entry of ram sevaks into ayodhya would be eased. it had also indicated it would transfer the 43 acres of undisputed land to the ram janmbhoomi nyas before june 2, they said. asserting that the vhp would do what the shankaracharya of kanchi said, international vice-president vishnu hari dalmiya said: ""you have to do a lot of things in a compromise. by toning down our stand we are showing we want a peaceful settlement to the dispute."" but the parishad is awaiting a formal announcement of the government''s intentions.

""we lost 3,000 temples. for the sake of goodwill we asked for only three. the kashi and mathura demands remain"", he said. having said that it will accept a court verdict, the vhp now has a lot of explaining to do. dalmiya said his attempt on friday was to clarify to the ""hindu samaj that the issue before the court was only whether a temple had existed at the disputed site and this is not a matter of faith."" the parishad has till now held resolutely that the court cannot adjudicate on a matter of faith. explaining it as a compromise that had to be made, vhp international vice-president vishnu hari dalmiya said: ""by toning down our stand we are showing that the parishad said it had an assurance from the centre to allow it to perform a symbolic puja at the undisputed site in ayodhya on march.

""let us first tackle march 15. we cannot take a decision all of a sudden."" nda allies would meet among themselves on the issue, she said. the allies are to meet early on thursday morning. the government, put in the dock early in the day by the opposition parties, stressed that it had nothing to do with sorabjee''s opinion expressed before the court. the attorney general himself clarified that he had given a legal interpretation of the 1994 judgment of the apex court before the judges, who had sought his opinion. the government, he maintained, had no role to play. but an angry opposition stalled proceedings in both houses of parliament demanding a statement from the prime minister and accusing him of doublespeak on the ayodhya issue. even the allies were moved to huddle into confabulations, including a telephone conversation with tdp chief chandrababu naidu in hyderabad, before six parties met the prime minister to convey their dissatisfaction. naidu, thanks to his clout within the nda and the opposition, is widely seen as someone who can decide the future of the nda government. apart from mamata and ajit singh, tdp leader yerran naidu, lok janshakti leader ram vilas paswan, and leaders of the dmk and the jd(u) were also present. emerging from the meeting, a senior leader said: ""this is highly objectionable. we are not satisfied with the government''s explanation that the attorney general was merely interpreting the 1994 judgment."" upset that they had not been consulted on so key a matter, the leader said: ""even if the government explanation is accurate, public perception is important too, so this should not have been done."" devendra prasad yadav of the jd(u) even suggested that sorabjee be removed. an irked mamata remarked: ""this is not a bjp government it is an nda government."" however, the bjp has come out strongly in favour of sorabjee. bjp spokesperson v k malhotra said: ""we endorse what the ag has said to the court. the bjp supports sorabjee''s assertion that the puja should be held under strict conditions."" malhotra also tried to disassociate the government from sorabjee''s statement. ""whatever the ag has said was not part of a written submission or an affidavit filed by the government. what sorabjee has said may not necessarily be the government''s view,"" said malhotra. the opposition, expectedly, is doing its best to stoke the fire. veteran cpm leader somnath chatterjee said, ""the secular allies have to decide now whether the country''s future is in safe hands"". later in the evening, the congress working committee passed a resolution condemning the government''s change of stand after having maintained in parliament and through the president''s address in the beginning of the session that it favoured status quo in ayodhya. the party has indicated that it will take on vajpayee in parliament on the issue. related storiesA govt clamps down on vhp activistsA temporary jails to keep ram bhaktsA vhp finds a loophole, says will still have pujaA nda allies back centre''s standA govt will obey sc order, says pmA govt was not keen on puja: sorabjeeA sc rules out symbolic puja in ayodhyaA nyas to go ahead with shila donationA chronology of eventsA full coverageA A A voice your opinionA text of supreme court ruling    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0
ayodhya: the continuing administrative squeeze around ayodhya and faizabad got tighter on saturday, with the cancellation or diversion of all trains reaching the twin towns till further notice. the last of the trains, carrying some 2,000 karsevaks from ayodhya, left town on friday evening. ironically enough, it was the sabarmati express, bound for ahmedabad in gujarat, the same ill-fated train which was attacked in godhra last wednesday. the lack of easy transportation to and from ayodhya has already begun to reflect in the numbers at karsevakpuram, the vhp headquarters in ayodhya. just before noon, the site of the purna ahuti yagna conducted every morning since february 24 looks deserted but for a dozen or so karsevaks. ''we have strict instructions not to let the media in,'' says the young volunteer in-charge of regulating the negligible human traffic to the holy fire. asked to explain the dwindling human mass, the local media in-charge of the vhp, sharad sharma, starts with a sullen denial. since the trains were stopped on friday, some 2,000 karsevaks arrived on saturday by other means. the local bjp leaders, re-elected mla lallu singh and the faizabad district party president mahant manmohan das, are more forthright. because of the administration's dictatorial ban on rail and road travel, religious-minded karsevaks are being prevented from reaching ayodhya, they complain. there are no exact estimates of how many karsevaks are still left behind in ayodhya. the figure varies from an optimistic 4,000 to an improbable 10,000. requests to visit ramsevakpuram -- the semi-permanent township which houses the vhp volunteers -- for an independent assessment, are firmly turned down. ''the karsevaks have told us not to send anyone from the media there... because the media can some times be too aggressive with its questioning,'' says sharma. that might be so, but he clearly has other things on his mind. on friday evening, a wire service photographer was manhandled inside ramsevakpuram and his chain snatched. just a stone's throw away from karsevakpuram, the administration has, in the past 24 hours, part-sealed the workshop where stone pillars for the proposed temple are being chiseled and carved. the gate used for bulk transportation has been locked up, with a single-file side entrance allowed for individual access. the men in uniform posted outside have orders not to let anyone unlock the main gate. but none of this is having a reassuring impact in the muslim areas of the temple town. from kutia to panjitola, kajiara to begumpura, the mood among the minorities remains grimly nervous. many families have moved their women and young ones to safer areas. but it is impossible to ascertain how many. mohammed salim, nephew of hashim ansari, the man who filed the original court petition against the installation of ram idols in 1949, claims that nearly every muslim family in panjitola located within shouting distance of the barbed-wire fencing that marks off the acquired land around the disputed masjid has seen some safety-driven migration. but in faizabad, khalil ahmed khan, of the faizabad helal committee, has compiled a list complete as of friday of those muslim families who have left ayodhya for safer destinations. while khan feels that the administration has clearer directions today than in december 1992 - both from the court and the central government to maintain the peace and status quo, there is ample room for concern.

ayodhya: chief minister rajnath singh on thursday succeeded in breaking some ice on the ayodhya deadlock when he managed to request the agitating vhp seers to scale down from their ram temple construction plan in order to save the vajpayee government from falling. the cm, who arrived in the temple town late on thursday evening along with urban development minister lalji tandon, drove straight to digambar akhara to call on mahant ramchandra paramhans das, prominent leader of the ram temple movement and chairman of mandir nirman samiti. the cm delivered a message from vajpayee to mahant das and persuaded him to withdraw the march 15 programme. though rajnath remained closeted with the mahant for about an hour, he refused to divulge details of his meeting with him. aEUR~aEUR~i have come here to discharge my duties as the cm and to ensure that law and order is not disturbed and peace and communal harmony prevail in the state. i have made a request to mahantji in this regard to cooperate with the state and central governments to maintain law and order,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he said.

"This story is from March 1, 2002  vadodara: police and other security officials were reduced to meek spectators at the vadodara railway station when the mob there went out of control. the deployment of policemen at the station proved grossly inefficient to handle the crisis. the policemen were outnumbered by the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) and bajrang dal activists many times over. with almost the entire train and a large portion of platform number one occupied by activists in an irate mood, the police were hardly in a position to take control of the situation. the end result being that several activists were moving around freely brandishing sharp-edged weapons. the police, fearful of flaring up matters further, had apparently decided to exercise restraint. commenting on the low deployment of security personnel on the railway station, a senior police official said that the situation was unprecedented. ""no one had expected such a mayhem at the railway station,"" he said. city police had rushed extra teams of police officials to help out the gujarat railway police (grp), but to no avail. said commissioner of police d d tuteja, ""the responsibility of arrangements on the railway station is of the grp. our officers were there just to help them out."" meanwhile, the city police have made arrangements to take care of any untoward incident in the city. three companies of the state reserve police (srp) and one company of rapid action force (raf) have been deployed in the city. tuteja said that the city police have intensified rounds in the city with additional patrol vehicles. ""we are keeping a strict vigil in the city. extra care is being taken in the sensitive areas of the city,"" he said. notwithstanding the arrangements made by the police, panic spread in the old city areas. several shopkeepers in the area downed their shutters after they came to know about the incident at the railway station where one person was killed. rumor mongers had a field day and the city control room was kept busy with inquiries regarding the situation in the city. several persons preferred not to travel to the heart of the city till they had confirmed that things were peaceful there."	0	0	1	0	0

"new delhi: the ayodhya sants and vishwa hindu parishad seemed to take a hard line on monday by stating that the moving of carved pillars would begin on march 15, but left the door open for a face-saving formula by giving the government till june to transfer the undisputed land for temple construction to begin.       read this story in...          A A hindi    members of the ram janambhoomi trust, headed by mahant ramchandradas paramhans, who met in the capital, have asked the government to give an assurance by march 12 that all bottlenecks will be removed to facilitate the ongoing purna ahuti yajna in ayodhya. this would include lifting the ban on movement of kar sevaks, removal of ""unnecessary"" security forces, and allowing the movement of the pillars to the undisputed land. it has also asked the government to assure them by march 12 that the undisputed land will be transferred to the trust by june 2, when the 100-day yajna concludes. the sants said if these demands were not met by the government, they would call upon all ""ram sevaks"" to move to ayodhya and court arrest if necessary. describing the temple plan as a peaceful one, the ramchandradas accused the centre of obstructing the yajna by preventing ram sevaks from going to ayodhya. clearly irked with the government''s stand, the mahant ruled out a meeting with prime minister atal bihari vajpayee, unless called by the latter: ""i have come to meet the vhp not the government. i am not here for a compromise,"" he said. ramchandradas, who is still smarting from the snub on january 27, when the prime minister rejected the sants'' demand, particularly targetted vajpayee, saying: ""we don''t trust the prime minister''s assurances anymore. he has repeatedly gone back on his words. we want a written assurance from the government."" vajpayee, he said, had done a volte face after promising a solution before march 12, as an ""election stunt"". he made comparisons between the government facilitation of the haj pilgrimage for muslims with stopping of ram sevaks from visiting their place of worship. ""he has become prime minister through my campaign for the ram temple,"" the irate sant stressed. the sants unanimously expressed extreme disappointment with the vajpayee government saying all other regimes, especially the congress which helped the temple cause, and even foreign rulers before independence had proved better than the bjp-led government. but they seemed less in sync on whether vajpayee''s intervention now could make them change their minds. they also condemned opposition parties for ""not mourning the killing of ram sevaks in godhra"" and said the resultant riots were a natural expression of grief and anger. the godhra incident, said ramchandradas, was ""premeditated and sponsored by pakistani agents."" vhp working president ashok singhal, who had left it to the sants to decide on the next course of action, endorsed monday''s decision, also denying that the june deadline to the government was intended as breathing space. ""construction will begin by june 2"", he stated. meanwhile, hectic confabulations are on to find a solution palatable to all parties. the shankaracharya of kannchi peeth is in the capital and is scheduled to meet the prime minister on monday night. singhal said this followed a meeting of the vhp and sants with the shankaracharya, who would ask vajpayee to meet their demands. the rss has already been working overtime to mediate between the government and the vhp and has even promised a solution provided the centre lifts the ban on kar sevaks going for the yajna to ayodhya. assuring that they would do nothing unconstitutional or violent, singhal said the vhp had not been asked by the government to stop its campaign. ""there is no legal hurdle. the government can give permission for anything"", he said. eight of the 10 sants who had met vajpayee after the chetawani yatra in january were present at monday''s meeting. the members of the trust are scheduled to meet again on tuesday. related storiesA vhp, rss leaders hold talksA number of kar sevaks dwindle in ayodhya A vhp, bjp workers named in fir on riotsA authorities lock vhp''s workshop in ayodhya    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	1	0	0
This story is from March 5, 2002  kanpur: joining hands with the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) over the ayodhya issue, the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) has stated that the government should give permission to karsewaks to reach ayodhya and offer prayers at ramjanmbhoomi without any restrictions. the rss leaders expressed apprehension that the situation might become tense if the government failed to withdraw the ban on the movement of karsewaks to ayodhya. the vhp also cut short its two-day meeting in the city and said it would stick to its karsewa decision taken during the first day of the meeting on sunday. the rss leaders justified the vhp decision and said the people were free to do karsewa as it was their democratic right to conduct puja according to their religion. the rss leaders were vocal about their views over the ayodhya issue during various tribute meetings held in the city on sunday. the rss workers also paid tributes to the karsewaks who were killed in the sabarmati express at godhra in gujarat. they said the muslim community should also condemn the killing of karsewaks in godhra. dr nayeem hamid, member of milli council and secretary of manav sadbhavana sansthan charged the government with inciting communal tension in the country and said internal terrorism was a major threat to the unity and integrity of the nation. he criticised the vhp stand over ayodhya and said the government should take strict measures to foil their plan.	0	0	0	0	0

"new delhi: the government does not appear to be in any hurry over the election of the new lok sabha speaker following the death of g m c balayogi on sunday but the post is likely to be retained by his party tdp, an important ally of the bjp. high level sources said that andhra pradesh chief minister and tdp supremo chandrababu naidu has to make the crucial decision about nominating his party member in the lok sabha for the top job. political circles feel tdp mp m jagannath, a dalit member from nagarkurnool reserved constituency in the telangana, could be the choice for the presiding officership if the party decided to retain the post to a dalit member. a practising doctor and a close associate of naidu, jagannath had also acted as tdp parliamentary party leader for some time during united front rule when renuka chaudhary was made a minister in the short-lived gujral government. if tdp decides to have an obc nominee for the post, parliamentary party leader k yerran naidu could emerge as a contender. naidu was a cabinet minister during the uf rule and hails from the coastal andhra region. the 27-member tdp, which is providing crucial outside support to the government, got the speaker''s post following a last-minute understanding between the party and bjp in 1998 which ushered in balayogi to the top job. opposition parties, united on the gujarat situation, today refrained from responding to queries about their stand on the next speaker.

"This story is from March 7, 2002  ahmedabad: gujarat returned to a relative calm on wednesday, a full week after the godhra train massacre, even as simmering tensions led to stray incidents in some parts of the state. in pahad village of mehmdabad, one person, who was working as a cook, was stabbed to death. four stab injury victims were admitted to municipal hospitals in ahmedabad - one each from rakhial, naranpura and gheekantha, and one from khedbrahma in sabarkantha district. the overall toll of gujarat touched the 544-mark by wednesday afternoon, excluding the 58 persons killed in the godhra incident last wednesday. out of this, 97 died in police firing, while the remaining were killed during other incidents of mob violence, according to the police control room, which also stated that the toll is going up because of the recovery of bodies in villages and not due to fresh killings. while the control room in ahmedabad claimed there was complete calm in the city overnight, stray incidents of violence were reported from other parts of the state. police said so far 3,976 persons have been arrested all over the state. in ahmedabad, shops, which opened in the walled city areas in the morning, downed their shutters following reports about fresh stabbing incidents which were denied by police. schools and other educational institutions also opened on wednesday after a week''s break and the city bus service also resumed. in surat, police said that two clashing groups resorted to severe stone pelting in the sensitive limbayat area on tuesday night around 10 pm. police intercepted and had to fire 8 rounds. police commissioner v k gupta said 10 persons sustained injuries in the firing. in combing operations carried out in surat on tuesday evening, 50 persons were held and a large quantity of weapons, including swords, knives, pipes and axes were seized. also, acid bulbs and crude petroleum bombs were seized during these operations. so far more than 432 arrests have been made in the city in connection with 80 cases of substantive offence of rioting, arson and murder since february 28. while control rooms in various cities claim of peace prevailing in the state, rumours of fresh violence in jhalod taluka of dahod district ran high. senior officials of vadodara range, however, denied of any such report. in bharuch, senior officials of the police department along with prominent citizens and district collector anju sharma led a peace march.

A A hindi    ""i will have to bow my head in shame if the mosque is now forcibly brought down."" it was ram jethmalani to lal krishna advani in 1990, a full two years before the babri masjid was actually demolished. in a long letter to advani, who was then the president of the bharatiya janata party, jethmalani pleaded for restraint, saying destruction of the mosque would plunge the country into turmoil and be a slur internationally. but why was jethmalani talking about destruction of the mosque when no one else in the country was? was the renowned lawyer only concerned about the legal implications of building the temple? or did he have some definite information that the mosque was going to be destroyed? or was it just the prescience of a long-time insider? asked about the letter, he told this correspondent: i stand by every word of it. but asked how he could have been so prophetic, he replied: ""all i can say is that i am no prophet."" jethmalani begins his letter saying it is a ""desperate appeal not to bring down the v p singh government which was on its last legs at the centre at that time. he then quickly moves on to ayodhya, the major crisis of the day. he says: ""the plain fact is that you do not own the land on which you propose to build the temple. moreover, a little familiarity with the indian penal code leads to only one conclusion: that building the temple if it involves the demolition of the mosque will also involve the commission of serious offences."" he goes on to caution advani that ""even the government cannot acquire the disputed mosque site and hand it over to the hindus ""without committing serious misuse of its land acquisition powers. it will not be able to sustain the acquisition as being meant for a public purpose before a court of law"". then, while emphasising the need for india to maintain its respect in the international community, jethmalani worries that ""i will have to bow my head in shame if the mosque is now forcibly brought down"". it has been repeatedly argued before the liberhans commission by those accused of participating in the demolition of the babri masjid (among them is advani who is now home minister) that it was an emotional act and not premeditated violence. jethmalani''s letter seems to indicate that the bringing down of the masjid, even if it happened in flash, belonged to a sequence which began at least two years earlier. related stories:A muslim board rejects kanchi seer''s proposalA muslim board has no role in dispute: vhpA one dead in bengal police-vhp clashA nda allies uneasy as vhp readies for puja    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	1	0	1	0	1
"faizabad: amidst heightening apprehensions over the march 15 programme of vhp and ram janambhoomi nyas, a group of hindus and muslims today took out a symbolic 'peace march' here to emphasise the need for communal harmony and national integration. the silent march, led by noted gandhian nirmala desphande, was taken out symbolically in view of the prohibitory orders. numbering about 100, the marchers carried placards with messages such as sanjhi sanskriti zindabad, nafrat fasad murdabad (hail common culture, down with hatred and fights), mandir nahin rozgar chahiye, jeene ka adhikar chahiye (we want jobs, not temple, we want right to live) and desh bhakti sarvochya daitva hai, nafrat failana samaj aur desh ke khilaf hai (love for country is the supreme duty, spreading hatred is against the society and country). although the organisers -- nagrik shanti morcha and all india rachnatmak samaj -- planned to take out the march through the city, police disallowed them citing prohibitory orders in force. the marchers then dispersed peacefully. later, deshpande told reporters that vhp's programme was ""against law and the constitution"" and demanded that it be stopped immediately. ""whatever is happening is wrong. i don't understand why this is being allowed,"" she said adding the law and the constitution should be respected at any cost. she advised vhp and others concerned with the ayodhya dispute to wait for the court verdict. ""if they have gone to the court, they should wait for its judgement and respect it. otherwise, everyone will settle issues through fights,"" she said. deshpande expressed confidence that a resolution would emerge. the organisers demanded that kar sevaks be ""thrown out"" of ayodhya immediately to ""end the atmosphere of fear"". they also demanded stern punishment for all those violating or defying the constitution and law of the land. the marchers also demanded immediate lifting of restrictions to ensure flow of essential commodities into faizabad district. ayodhya city falls in faizabad district.

This story is from March 3, 2002  mumbai: while the country watched with horror as godhra burned, old-timers recalled that this town in gujarat is no stranger to communal riots. in fact, a carnage which erupted in godhra more than 70 years ago had a profound impact on the life of former prime minister morarji desai.in 1928, desai was the deputy collector of godhra, a post from which he resigned after the riots. a biography of the late pm, written by veteran journalist d.f. karaka, reveals that the british administration wanted desai to lay the blame for the disturbances at the door of the majority community. unwilling to comply, desai quit the service and joined the freedom struggle.morarji, which was published by the times of india press in 1965, carries a detailed account of the godhra incident. desai told his biographer that the district collector, one mr hartshone, was evidently partial and unfairly wanted to blame the hindus for the riot. interestingly, the assistant collector h.v.r. iengar, who later became governor of the reserve bank of india, stood by desai in the subsequent court hearing.the trial court judge millard, who was deputed as special magistrate for this case, apparently observed that desai was siding with the hindus. in the course of the trial, desai was cross-examined for an entire day by defence counsel i.i. chundrigar, who later became pakistan''s prime minister. ``but he could not find a flaw in my evidence,'''' desai has been quoted as saying.desai also criticised the district superintendent of police, a mr ziauddin, for his role in the affair.when the case went to the sessions court in appeal, the sessions judge exonerated desai of all the strictures that millard had passed against him. desai''s name was thus cleared of the allegation that he was anti-muslim. but enraged by the events, desai demanded a transfer.when this request was denied, he went on leave for four months until he was posted as personal assistant to the collector of ahmedabad. hartshone then brought pressure on the bureaucracy to institute a departmental inquiry against desai. this was completed in april 1930, and resulted in a sharp demotion. this proved the last straw, and desai resigned.the rest, of course, is history. desai plunged into the freedom struggle, met mahatma gandhi and returned to the government in 1937--this time as a minister. but he always maintained that godhra had proved to be a turning point in his life. 	0	0	0	1	0

"ahmedabad: censorship today doesnaEUR(tm)t necessarily need a pair of scissors. it can be done by the click of a button. police across gujarat, apparently on the orders from the government in gandhinagar, is using its powers to gag the electronic media. news channels across gujarat, which were giving a blow-by-blow account of the riots, blinked off the television screens in several cities as the police silenced certain channels. on saturday, ahmedabadis were cut off from the world in more ways than one. forced inside their homes for the third consecutive day, desperate attempts of the people to know what was happening in the city met with blank screens as the state government blocked all satellite news channels from beaming into city homes. exercising special powers, city police commissioner pc pande issued notices to cable operators in the city directing them to block all programmes that could incite violence, enmity between two communities and disrupt law and order situation in the city. those not adhering to the directives would be subject to punishment, the notice said. following the same, all three news channels were pulled off air early morning by most cable operators. black screens irked residents no end who were depending on the news channels to provide them with updates on the situation in the city. in vadodara, star news channel was blocked, while authorities in surat blocked two local channels - my tv and channel surat. in rajkot, police commissioner upendra singh has directed cable operators to block star news and four local news channels. he has also banned publication of special supplements of three local gujarati eveningers. aEURoemost of the control rooms in the city received phone calls from the collector''s office to black out star news, zee news, cnn and aaj tak,"" said president of the ahmedabad cable operator''s association pramod pandya. according to surat police commissioner vineet gupta, directives had been issued to all cable operators to refrain from showing anything which was provocative.

""for people of the country the mandir or masjid is not an issue at all"", he said. he said the verdict of the recent assembly polls, particularly in uttar pradesh, has proved that the bjp was sinking and it can no more bank upon the hindutva card.

"new delhi: the union cabinet on thursday evening recommended president''s rule in up, even as bsp leader mayawati resigned her lok sabha seat and hinted at a new proximity to the bjp as a prelude to a pact for ministry-formation in the state. the cabinet also recommended that the newly-constituted assembly be kept under suspended animation. earlier, no party in up had been able to convince governor vishnukant shastri about the backing of the requisite number of mlas to form a stable government. parliamentary affairs minister pramod mahajan said the cabinet, after discussing the governor''s report, agreed to endorse his recommendation for president''s rule. this has been sent to the president for his approval. thereafter, it would have to be ratified by parliament within 60 days. asked how the government proposed to get it through the rajya sabha, mahajan said, ""let us wait and see."" this statement and the news conference mayawati held earlier in the day, along with her mentor kanshi ram, is being seen as a sign that 60 days are not being kept for parliamentary approval but to stitch up a bsp-bjp alliance. at the briefing, mayawati said she was leaving for lucknow to lead her party legislators and cadres. this is also being read in political circles as an effort to scotch rumours that she might accept a central berth, in return for the bsp extending support to a bjp-led government in up. interestingly, both mayawati and kanshi ram welcomed the up governor''s decision to recommend president''s rule in the state for the time being and admitted they had been meeting bjp leaders. adding credence to the possibility of some understanding having been reached between the bjp and the bsp, mayawati''s comments on ayodhya and the communal carnage in gujarat were muted. indeed, the position she took revealed a pro-bjp tilt in sharp contrast to the bsp line in the assembly elections. replying to a question on the ayodhya tangle, mayawati said while the disputed land should remain with the centre until the court verdict, the so-called undisputed land around the site could be handed over for temple construction. ""we have no objection to that,"" she said. mayawati said she had told the prime minister at the all-party meeting on the gujarat situation that since the train attack at godhra had sparked the trouble, there should be an inquiry into the incident as well as the subsequent communal riots. she took a swipe at the congress, saying ""the ayodhya problem had begun with the shilanyas during the congress rule"". evading a direct answer to a question on the demand to ban the vishwa hindu parishad, she said: ""let there be an all-party meeting on all communal organisations and an inquiry into their activities aEUR"" we have to rise above political considerations to decide an issue like that."" related stories A cabinet nod for central rule in upA rajnath rules out snap elections    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 7, 2002  the gujarat government has banned ptv in the state. the ban is of a price with the overall current inclination in this country to look for the hand across the border whenever things go wrong on native soil. but while people in ahmedabad, vadodara and elsewhere may not have access to reactions to the riots in islamabad or karachi, what about the pictures of happenings in their cities being beamed across the entire world? bbc world for instance went to town with visuals of armed goons roaming the streets and the commentary that hindus were attacking muslims. the power of the electronic media once more became evident as riots broke out. those in authority both in delhi and ahmedabad could only hem and haw at the clear evidence of police inaction during the initial stages of the riots and even later in the countryside where the cops admitted that they were not being able to do anything to control the situation. the print media are obviously handicapped in this regard and its accusations can always, be and is, denied. but with the electronic media, it is here and now, those against whom the finger is pointed are themselves telling the story through their inaction, unaware perhaps that everything is being filmed. aware of what was being seen by millions and their reaction, union minister arun jaitley almost told the media, while appearing on star news, to exercise restraint in the national interest. how often have we heard that plea? where was the concern for national interest when gujarat was allowed to burn and the government came out with the flimsy excuse that the army could not be deployed earlier as it took time to arrange for area maps. though narendra modi is new to the job, even he should have known that such maps are always there with the police and only have to be asked for. having said this, however, one does feel that the electronic media should also think twice about treating a communal holocaust as yet another story which needs to be explored thoroughly. for instance, the big fight programme on star, featuring narendra mohan, a bjp member of the rajya sabha. why he is being singled out for mention is the way he almost violently defended the aEURoehinduaEUR cause. such reactions can only steel the determination throughout the country to go in for further mayhem. such programmes certainly do not serve any purpose as in any case the nation knows what mohan, his party and the sangh parivar stand for. generally speaking, however, things could not have been kept under wraps as jaitley would have liked. and why did pramod mahajan get so excited on sahara channel when s. nihal singh politely inquired as to whether the prime minister did not give the impression of an aged man no longer sure of himself. seeing atal behari vajpayee these days thataEUR(tm)s exactly the impression viewers get. karangapara village in west bengalaEUR(tm)s durgapur is not only far away from gujarat, but it seems to live in a world of its own judging from an etv bangla programme. the village has never seen any political activity, no wall writing, no disputes leave alone killings. not that it is located in the back of beyond, it is fairly prosperous, judging from the visuals and its residents as alert as anybody else. but, as a political activist sought to explain, aEURoewe do our political work outside the village and do not allow our own atmosphere to be polluted.aEUR selfish, would you say? and if politics is polluting why go for it, even outside the village?	0	0	0	1	0

This story is from March 10, 2002  chandigarh: bjp''s central leadership has advised a ''wait and watch'' policy to its haryana unit over the latter''s demand to sever its alliance with the ruling indian national lok dal (inld) led by chief minister om prakash chautala. the election committee of the party, which met in delhi on march 9 to review the party''s performance in the recent assembly elections, took up the haryana unit''s demand casually, advising it to show restraint as the senior leadership of the party is at present busy with developments in uttar pradesh and gujarat. the haryana unit of the bjp has been clamouring for quite a while to snap its ties with the inld on the plea that it is losing its foothold as well as its identity in the state as it is never taken into confidence by inld while taking important policy decisions. this battle of nerves between the two parties reached a flash point on the eve of the recent yamunanagar assembly bye-election for which the inld also decided to field its candidate despite the fact that the bjp had already declared its candidate. in the last assembly elections, which the two had fought jointly, this seat had fallen in bjp''s kitty. defending his party''s decision to field its candidate for the bye-election, inld supremo chautala is on record having stated that the bjp''s state unit had violated the very norms of alliance as it did not show the courtesy of taking his party into confidence while deciding about its candidate.so disturbed was the state leadership of the bjp at that time over chautala''s allegation that it sought its central leadership''s permission to part ways with the inld. political observers feel that the irony is that while the state unit has its own political compulsions, its leadership in delhi cannot afford to annoy the inld which is supporting the vajpayee government as an important constituent of the ruling national democratic alliance( inld).the inld has five members in the lok sabha. in fact, it is widely felt in the political circles here that what has added to the worries of the state unit of bjp is its dismal performance against an impressive victory of the inld in the yamunanagar bye-election. even more disturbing for its leadership is that the party suffered defeat despite the fact that yamunanagar constituency is considered to be its stronghold. such was the defeat that the party candidate even lost his security in the bye-election. whether or not the bjp supports the inld in the coming rajya sabha elections is a moot point.the latter will, however, require its support to win both the seats in the elections, which are due to be held on march 27. but doubts still persist about the longevity of the alliance.talking to media persons recently in the press lobby of the assembly, leader of the bjp legislature party krishan pal gujjar expressed confidence that the days of his party''s alliance with the inld were numbered.	0	0	0	0	0

"This story is from March 8, 2002  ahmedabad: oranges, sugar candy and blessings came the riot victims'' way as the shankaracharya of kanchipuram, jayendra saraswati, came calling on the godhra carnage victims'' families and riot victims of the city on thursday. from juntanagar in ramol to chaurasia ni chali along geeta mandir road to the civil hospital, the seer met victims'' kins and reassured them and prayed for peace. it all started at the sardar vallabhbhai patel international airport premises where a motley crowd waited for shankaracharya''s arrival. the state treasurer of the bjp, surendra patel, and leader of the opposition at ahmedabad municipal corporation, dharmendra shah, stood for the saffron brigade, while vhp was represented by state general secretary jaydeep patel and senior worker devjibhai rawat. soon the saffron-clad seer from kanchi flew into the airport aboard a private aircraft. another brief spell of wait followed and finally the shankaracharya was ready. a motorcade of no less than 20 vehicles zoomed out of the airport premises and headed for the first destination - juntanagar in ramol area. ten ram sevaks from juntanagar itself had been burnt alive on board the sabarmati express at godhra. the seer in his purple-hued land cruiser zipped into juntanagar where localites and victims'' family members chanted: ""shri ram, jai ram..."" under a small shamiana set up near girishbhai panchal''s residence. panchal had lost four members of his family in the godhra carnage. right arm raised, showering blessings and his face lit up in a benevolent smile, the shankaracharya stayed at the site for no more than five minutes and scarcely spoke a word. young mayur chaundagarh tried hard, in vain, to pass a photo of his aunt amiben (31) - one of the 58 godhra victims - for shankaracharya''s blessings. it was time to leave and the motorcade zoomed along the narol-naroda highway, slowing down occasionally to look at soot-covered and burnt buildings lining the road. minutes later the seer was once again surrounded by eager devotees and godhra victims'' family members at chaurasia ni chali along geeta mandir road. this locality had lost two members - jiniben dabi and premben dabi to the godhra massacre. a narrow lane that led to the victims'' houses was packed to capacity with localities wishing to catch a glimpse of the godman. a brief stop outside a victim''s house and it was time to move on again. the next halt was at geeta mandir in khagrapith area. media persons were treated to some excerpts from ''ramayan'' and advised to refrain from ""unnecessarily playing up sporadic incidents of violence"" and asked to ""aid in restoring peace in gujarat"". ""i am pained by the bloodshed in gujarat and my visit is aimed at blessing the victims and pray for the return of peace in gujarat. god is one and so is our mother - bharat mata. members of both communities should live like brothers and not get swayed by emotional outbursts. we should live in peace like ram and laxman, not like bali and sugreev,"" he said. ""after the earthquake i had visited kutch and bhuj and had stayed here for a week. i have once again come to help calamity-struck people of gujarat. the state government should hasten its relief and rehabilitation measures and should remain secular in its outlook at all costs,"" he said. ""i have also spoken to the union minister for home on relief activities in gujarat,"" he added. the godman also pledged to help reinstate peace in the state and aid the localities in restarting economic and academic activities. amidst chants of ''jai shree ram'' the holyman left geeta mandir for the civil hospital. a huge crowd of inquisitive onlookers and devotees eager to touch shankaracharya''s feet waited there as the visitors entered g1 block (burns and plastic surgery ward) of civil hospital. this was the longest stop made by the godman. the hospital tour commenced with the godhra victims, who were the first to be blessed with oranges and clothes by the godman. shankaracharya then called on other riot victims of the city.

This story is from March 10, 2002  oh god, give us strong enough words to condemn the carnage of godhra, the rest of gujarat and some other parts of the country. the present ones have become obsolete. or, if the senseless killings that have taken place during the past 55 years, first in united and then in partitioned india, are the logical corollary of adherence to religion, the humanity would rather do well without it. the clean chit that home minister advani and other bjp leaders have given to gujarat chief minister modi is understandable, but what defies intelligence is the distinction made between the victims of godhra and other parts of the state. no amount of money can fill the void the dependents of those killed or burnt alive will have to face. but to discriminate in aEURoecompensatingaEUR the deaths is beyond all comprehension. the ayodhya mess seems to be inching towards some sort of adjustment. but there are still many pitfalls: some of which are, (1) what credence can be given to the vhp which has a record of flouting the earlier ones, (2) is the aEURoeundisputedaEUR land really undisputed as it includes a large graveyard of the muslims and by handing over the land the area where the masjid stood will become inaccessible, and (3) what will be the stand of the nda constituents. however, the kanchi shankaracharya deserves all praise for introducing an element of sanity. the murder of a samajwadi party mla at the main gate of raj bhawan has overshadowed the governoraEUR(tm)s advocacy of the presidentaEUR(tm)s rule. otherwise also, it makes little difference if the state is ruled by rajnath or by advani. however, it provides time to the bjp and the bsp to work out modalities for the formation of a government. mayawatiaEUR(tm)s silence on gujarat carnage, endorsement of the governoraEUR(tm)s recommendation and decision to quit lok sabha are a clear pointer to a new political scenario in up. * * * * * * * * * * * ** * * ** ** * * * * the press under review has reacted to all these events on expected lines but with a restrain. while condemning the godhra muslims aEURoeif they are responsible for the carnage there on 2/3; the next day jadeed amal want to know as to how many cops have been punished for the negligence of duty in gujarataEUR. rashtriya sahara (4/3), while wailing the pmaEUR(tm)s appeal for peace and not distinguishing between godhra and the rest of gujarat, urges all the right-thinking people to take steps to prevent the fire from spreading. sahafat (4/3), on the other hand is sharply critical of advani for providing a sort of justification for the mayhem by holding it as a reaction to godhra. * * * * * * * ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * while gujarat is struggling to come to terms with itself, yet another, rather larger, inferno is waiting in the wings if all does not go well on march 15. this is not the time to refer to all that has been written about the vhp and its role, but of praying that reason has an upper hand on the sentiment on both the sides. however, it would be only apt to refer to rashtriya saharaaEUR(tm)s endorsement aEURoeof the pmaEUR(tm)s stand that aEURoeany decision in this regard will be taken only after taking parliament and the opposition into confidence.aEUR * * * ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the urdu press has expressed disagreement with the course adopted by the state governor regarding the formation of a new government. sahafat (8/3) holds that on the basis of the accepted parliamentary practice, the invitation to form a government to the bjp at the centre and the apex courtaEUR(tm)s judgment in the bommai case, the largest single party should have been given a chance to prove its majority in the houseaEUR. jadeed amal of the same day opines that aEURoehad the situation been the opposite one, the governor would have taken the same decision which had been taken in regard to kalyan singh and mayawati. the in dinon disagrees with the governoraEUR(tm)s plank of stability. aEURoeit is none of his business and he should have invited the largest single partyaEUR, says the daily. rashtriya sahara is quite harsh on the aEURoesecularaEUR parties, particularly the congress, for paving the way for the imposition of the presidentaEUR(tm)s rule.aEUR all the dailies expressed shock at the tragic death of lok sabha speaker and paid rich tirbutes to the qualities of head and heart of the departed soul.	0	0	0	1	0

This story is from March 11, 2002  bangalore: when jnanpith award recipient u.r. ananthamurthy took to the streets for the ``save kudremukh agitation'''', eyebrows were raised. many were curious why at the age of 69 he was getting into such things. a yen for politics? for fame? or has his writing faded out? after the latest activism of letters to president k.r. narayanan and ram janmabhoomi nyas trustee pejawar swami visvesha teertha expressing strongly his distaste over the ram temple movement, ananthamurthy spoke to the times of india to answer the whys. what is the reason for this sudden activism by you on issues like kudremukh, english-medium schools and ayodhya? i am getting old and as an indian citizen, i should do whatever i can for what i spiritually believe in. i was active all along in an intellectual sort of way. as a student i was active in various movements, but i took time off to mature as a writer. i wish i had responded to this communal issue early, though in 1992, as central sahitya akademi chairman i had organised discussions on rabindranath tagore''s gora, which examines and rejects hindutva as an ideology to bind the country. do you think your actions will make an impact on any of the issues you raised? it may raise some kind of hope for like-minded people. apathy is terrible and that is what has happened to our country -- no ideas, no big movements. only this mad fundamentalistic race between hindus and muslims. i have reacted as a hindu with deep religious feelings, responding from the core, rather than the high and mighty peak of a secularist. as for impact, on the kudremukh issue, i think the karnataka government has responded positively and i still hope they will not give permission for mining there. what is the solution to the ayodhya issue? i would like a large majority of hindus to say we don''t want a temple after so much bloodshed. i would like the hindus to reject these false vhp people. a true religious voice should speak and i believe india''s inherent spirituality can be revived. i feel ashamed that even when i speak of the recent incidents, i have to be politically correct about condemning the death of both hindus and muslims. the hindu religion does not have a jehad, no god is considered `false''. education minister h. vishwanath has said when your grandchildren are in english schools, how can you oppose additional english-medium high schools? there are two aspects to it: if there are only good kannada-medium schools all of us will send our children to those schools. if there is a choice between a bad kannada-medium school and a good english-medium school all parents will send their children to the good school. so all schools should be equally equipped. are the issues you have raised either an indication of your political leanings or an attempt to enter politics? long ago, in my socialist days, i had a dream to enter politics. i campaigned for the janata parivar in 1983 and against indira gandhi in 1977. now, i just want to raise political issues. you don''t need to belong to a party to enter politics. it is also a means of trying to change people''s minds and to persuade them to your way of thinking. i am absolutely not interested in any positions of power.  	0	0	0	0	0

""rama and lakshmana were born of different mothers but lived amicably aiding and assisting each other. so we are all children of bharat mata, why can''t we live in peace together?"" the seer wondered.

""permission diya jayega, koi taklif nahin hai,"" he claimed. ""though talks for the peace process have just begun, both the nyas and the muslim personal law board (mplb) have already agreed to abide by the supreme court''s verdict on this case. whatever happens next at ayodhya will be in accordance with the court''s decision. till the supreme court gives its ruling, status quo will be maintained at ayodhya. all people concerned have agreed to maintain peace in black and white, while discussions to resolve the issue are on,"" he said. the seer also called upon the masses to refrain from getting swayed by the vhp''s ""emotional outbursts."" ""peace and brotherhood should be maintained at all costs, especially in gujarat because here every name has a bhai or a ben attached to it. the vhp is doing good work but its ''pracharaks'' are often prone to getting excited and lose sight of proper judgement. aam janta ko ye sab nahin sunna hai (masses should not pay any heed to this),"" he counselled. walking the tight-rope like a true mediator, the godman thus replied to a query: ""i have also spoken to the central government. ram sevaks will no more be stopped from going to ayodhya. they have in the past and will continue to be part of the rituals at ram janambhoomi. but, under no circumstances will peace be breached.""

"new delhi: shahi imam of jama masjid ahmed shah bukhari on wednesday said the efforts of kanchi shankaracharya jayendra saraswati and prime minister''s office to resolve ayodhya dispute were only intended to ""divert"" the people''s attention from the ""naked barbarism"" in gujarat. ""there is no dispute. the matter is in the court. what is being discussed between seer, vhp or the pmo is a mystery as no decision, whether disputed or undisputed, can be achieved without the stamp of the court,"" bukhari told reporters here. the government was aware about the decision of vhp six months back and if such efforts had been initiated at that time, these could have been seen as a move to seek a solution, the shahi imam said, and added: ""now the centre is trying to dig the well when fire has already started."" he said the entire exercise was a move to ""trap"" the minority community. ""talks have been held with muslim personal law board, who do not have any locus standi in the dispute,"" he said, and lambasted the board members for falling into the ""trap laid by the centre"". the imam said that the pontiff had called him on wednesday and sought his support to resolve the dispute. ""however, i have made it clear to him that i will extend all help if efforts are to resolve the gujarat crisis."" ""by raking up the ayodhya dispute, government is trying to divert the attention of people from the naked barbarism that took place in gujarat last week,"" he said. the shahi imam said he had conveyed to the seer that he was willing to participate in any efforts that were initiated to ""douse the communal fire in gujarat."" he said that all india babri masjid action committee was holding its special session on march 9 to decide the future course of action. appealing to the government not to fuel any communal frenzy by taking a partisan stand, the shahi imam said, ""any organisation or indiuvidual or even vhp should be made to understand that no one is above law."" he warned that any wrong move by the government would have adverse reaction especially in uttar pradesh.

"This story is from March 10, 2002  ahmedabad: diamonds, textiles and chemicals sectors which constituted 88 per cent of gujarat''s total exports of rs 49,500 crore in 2000-01, have been severely hit by the recent riots. the diamond, gems and jewellery industry accounts for 50 per cent of the state''s total exports. this sector was just recovering from the september 11 terror attacks in the us. diamond exports were worth $652.50 million in january 2002 as against $520.20 million in january 2001, registering a growth of 25.43 per cent. ""diamond output was down by about 30 per cent during and after the riots. the industry has suffered a production loss of around rs 200 crore due to the riots,'''' said pravin nanavati, president of the surat diamond association. the industry could make up for the production loss by working overtime only if normalcy is maintained and employees are able to come to work. any prolonged disruption would hit export orders. petroleum products worth rs 6,400 crore constituted 12.9 per cent of gujarat''s exports in 2000-01. as these exports are from large companies like reliance petroleum, they are not expected to be affected. chemicals, pharmaceutical and plastics exports were of rs 6300 crore in 2000-01 and constituted 12.7 per cent of gujarat''s total exports. satish shah, gujarat region chairman of the basic chemicals, pharmaceuticals & cosmetics export promotion council (chemexcil), said the production losses in ahmedabad itself would be about rs 50 crore per day. ""in many chemicals the production is through batch processes and once a batch is discontinued it gets wasted completely and cannot be re-used. these losses are irrecoverable. companies will have to spend more money to run new batches to meet their export obligations,"" he explained. the textiles and garments industry had exports worth rs 5700 crore in 2000-01 and constituted 11.5 per cent of gujarat''s exports. the riots have caused losses of around rs 300 crore to the production and sale of fabrics manufactured in 18 textile mills and over 200 process houses and powerloom units. many are still closed as fear-stricken workers have left for their native places. except for the big textile units like arvind and ashima most of the other units had to keep their shutters down as workers did not report for duty for a week. the textile industry in surat which was recovering from its nearly month-long closure due to protests against high power cost is now faced with the riots. for long gujarat claimed to have ""least man-days lost among leading industrialised states in india and the highest productivity per employee/worker (alongwith maharashtra) in india"". but, this may not hold true today."	0	0	0	0	0

"after last sundayaEUR(tm)s electoral verdicts, congress leaders have started counting their states and biding their time, waiting to be kicked into power despite themselves. you donaEUR(tm)t need to be a psephologist to see that these election results were more than just a coincidence of electoral cycle, that there is a swing away from the ruling nda in all the four states. so, can the congress begin its countdown to power? iaEUR(tm)m not so sure. congresswallas would do well not to start counting their states too soon. for starters, they could ponder over some plain facts. one, while there is a swing away from the nda, there is no corresponding swing in favour of the congress. compared to the last lok sabha elections, the congress has also lost votes, and not just in up. yes, they won the elections in punjab and uttaranchal, but both these were technical victories rather than knock-outs. yes, they are likely to, or at least till three days ago looked likely to, add gujarat to the kitty next year. but can they retain this momentum when rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh and delhi aEUR"" all the states ruled by the congress aEUR"" come up for elections late next year? two, the congress at the moment is an also-ran in four of the biggest states in the country. bihar, up, tamil nadu and west bengal account for 201 seats in the lok sabha. in its present state, the congress would be lucky to win 20 of these seats. which means that it needs to win another 252 seats from the remaining 342, or three-fourths of the seats where it contends seriously, in order to reach the magical figure of 272 on its own. if the project of getting a majority on its own is not feasible, is the congress willing to enter into coalitions, say with the samajwadi party in up, the rjd in bihar and one of the dks in tamil nadu? is it ready to evolve institutional mechanisms for sharing power? three, all the surveys indicate that in most of the states the congress is still preferred by the underprivileged, the poor, the dalits, the lower obcs and minorities. but in the last few years the partyaEUR(tm)s ideological position on the economic policy has rarely betrayed a sensitivity towards the demands and needs of this section. perhaps, the bjp can afford to be gung-ho about privatisation and liberalisation, but this posture sits uneasily with the congressaEUR(tm)s social profile. what is the party going to do to bridge this yawning gap? what does it have to offer to its own potential voters? the fate of the congress depends on how it handles these three issues, and whether it can create an institutional dynamics to address these. ramamanohar lohia, the architect of anti-congressism, once said that the socialists lacked a aEUR~aEUR~will to poweraEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). three decades later, the same question now haunts the congress. does the congress have an institutionalised will to power? iaEUR(tm)m not for a moment doubting the congress leadersaEUR(tm) insatiable desire for unlimited personal power. the point is: can they translate their personal ambitions into an institutionalised will?

""be it the personnel of administration or public, they were angry with the leaders and wanted that they should solve the problem as early as possible,"" he told the commission probing the demolition of the disputed structure at ayodhya. deposing as a witness, he said that since the matter related to the disputed structure was very sensitive, ""the public and kar sevaks generally were strongly against delay in the courts for one reason or the other"". roy, who is the working president of the hindu mahasabha, said that preceding the december 6 event, sadhus, sants, leaders and kar sevaks who had assembled at ayodhya believed that the lucknow bench of allahabad high court would decide the land aquisition case pending with it as the arguments were complete and judgement was reserved. ""every day, every hour, they waited for the verdict. they expected that operative part of the judgement comprising few lines would be announced before december 6 even if the body of the judgement was announced later,"" he said. however, he said, as days passed both hope and anger for the court went side-by-side.

This story is from March 31, 2002  ahmedabad: as if the ongoing violence in the state was not enough, the gujarat university had its share of scuffles and slogan-shouting on saturday. imposition of the essential services maintenance act (esma) on the university staff was the culprit once again with executive council members like k s shastri and narhari amin shouting slogans against the act and akhil bharatiya vidhyarthi parishad shouting slogans against shastri. in the heat of the moment, one private security official posted near the vice chancellor''s chamber, hit university employee arvind shah so hard with his gun butt that he fell down unconscious. that was enough to bring all proceedings to an end. while the employees rushed to take shah to the hospital, most of the executive council members walked out of the meeting. the remaining council members hastily passed all the matters on the agenda. this included deciding whether or not to hold exams on april 18. many are worried that if the exams are not postponed, they will clash with the standard x and xii exams and create many administrative problems for the authorities. shah has even registered a police complaint against the private security guard saying he was hit while shouting slogans in the meeting room. this is perhaps the first time in a long while that matters have become so serious in the university. officials insist matters would not have come to such a pass if vice-chancellor naresh ved had been a little more firm. to add to the woes of the authorities, at least three different unions representing staff and teachers have said they will not come to work from monday if the armed security personnel are not removed from the university offices. they allege that the atmosphere in the university has become too hostile for them to continue work. the situation became tense when abvp members suddenly stormed into the university offices shouting slogans against shastri. till then the employees and teachers had only stood outside the main building and shouted slogans against esma so that the executive council members hear them.	0	0	1	0	1
"bangalore: the rss on friday sharply criticised the supreme court order on the shila pujan in ayodhya and said it appeared to have passed the verdict in haste. it also felt that thursday's clarificatory order of the supreme court barring all religious activities on the entire acquired land did not enhance the court's prestige. ""the supreme court did not go into the merits of the case. it appears that the supreme court is more interested in maintaining the status quo"", rss spokesperson m g vaidya told reporters at channehahalli on the city outskirts, where rss' general council is holding its three-day session. ""the supreme court appears to have passed the interim order in haste"", he said in response to a question. ""did they write the judgement in haste?"", he asked. the fact that the supreme court on its own issued a clarification to its march 13 order ""is not a point which enhances the apex court's prestige"", he remarked. ""if this amounts to contempt of court, i am ready to go the arundhati roy way"", vaidya said. he said the rss ""faulted"" the march 13 order on two counts -- that it ""contravenes"" the 1994 verdict of a five-member bench of the supreme court, and that wednesday's verdict has ""raised a new dispute over undisputed land, on which even muslims had not advanced any claim."" vaidya said rss wants muslims to respect the hindu sentiments on the ayodhya issue, and not to press its case. ""mandir exists there and there is no mosque"". ""we want to construct a grand ram temple where now there is a ramlalla idol in sanctum sanctorum"", he said. rss, vaidya said, wants the central government to take into consideration the spirit of the 1994 judgement and hand over the undisputed land to vhp. he urged that a special judge be appointed in lucknow bench of the allahabad high court to hear the case on a day-to-day basis so that the final verdict is delivered in one-and-a-half years. vaidya said in the last eight years, only 22 witnesses had been examined and if the hearing goes on at this pace, it would take 30 years to settle the dispute. he reiterated that the government should remove all restrictions (imposed in view of the march 15 programme of vhp) placed in the way of ram sevaks and piligrims who are going to karsevapuram in ayodhya to offer poornahuti.

"nilanjana bhaduri jha new delhi: having been handed a face-saving formula, the vishwa hindu parishad went on the offensive again on friday, saying a senior government official receiving the shila daan at ayodhya meant that the government had in principle accepted the vhp stand for temple construction at the ramjanmabhoomi site.

new delhi: the prime minister turned down gujarat chief minister narendra modi's suggestion for a snap poll as he feels the state bjp's assessment that the communal polarisation, following the riots, could lead the party to victory is misplaced. bjp sources here said the violence has taken its toll on economic activity and has affected enough hindu businesses to neutralise the polarisation the state unit is talking about. two, if the state government seeks dissolution of the assembly, there is no guarantee the election commission would call elections soon enough for the party to ''benefit'' from such a polarisation. three, if elections are held soon, the assessment is that they would be so bloody they might be difficult to control. as a senior bjp leader put it rather euphemistically, ''if elections are held now, when tempers are running high, the mindsets would harden further.'' of course, the pm does not want to replace modi as yet for two reasons --he does not want to be seen to be acting under pressure from the opposition and with modi having become something of a ''hero'' in sangh circles, it is clearly not the right time to move him out. moreover, with the decisive rout of the bjp in the delhi civic polls and the cross-voting in the rajya sabha elections in karnataka, which saw the defeat of party candidate tharadevi siddharta, the bjp leadership feels it should not risk an election in gujarat. as things stand, it is rapdly disappearing from the political map: currently, it is only in power in gujarat, jharkhand and himachal pradesh. it was forced to dissolve the assembly in goa to check dissidence in its ranks. the bjp's relationship with its allies is not too happy either: in tamil nadu, the dmk has cut its ties with the bjp; in andhra pradesh, the tdp is hesitating to name its nominee for a successor to the late gmc balayogi, lok sabha speaker; in punjab, the akali dal is still sore that the bjp let it down in the recent assembly elections; in orissa, the biju janata dal is not happy with the way the bjp's sangh relatives in the vhp/bajrang dal stormed the state assembly. battered by electoral defeats, internal rifts and a record of poor governance --in some cases, criminal negligence, as in gujarat-- the bjp will have a full agenda on its hands when its national executive meets in goa on april 12/13/14.

This story is from March 15, 2002  hyderabad: chief minister chandrababu naidu said on thursday that the ayodhya issue has become complicated as a result of its mishandling by political parties and religious leaders; therefore, it was time for leaders to put their heads together and arrive at a consensus on the issue in the larger interest of the nation. talking to reporters at ntr trust bhavan, naidu said the issue had been hanging fire for long but unfortunately, there had been no wholehearted effort by anyone to find a solution to it. naidu said the tdp had made it clear to the bjp that it would extend outside support to the government as long as it adhered to the common agenda of the national democratic alliance (nda). the chief minister said the political atmosphere in the country had become vitiated due to the ayodhya imbroglio. he observed that it was unfortunate that while all parties had stated that they would abide by the decision of the supreme court, their reaction to wednesday's verdict had been disappointing, each reacting differently. appealing to all political parties to support the supreme court judgement, he said the political situation in the country now was so sensitive that any development in ayodhya had a reaction in other parts of the country. parties should keep religion out of politics.	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 15, 2002  ahmedabad: the national commission for minorities (ncm) has come down heavily on the state government and the police for their inefficiency in curbing the riots that broke out after the burning of sabarmati express at godhra. an overriding sentiment implicit in a memorandum submitted to prime minister atal behari vajpayee by the ncm, stated that the minorities in gujarat have lost complete faith in the government, especially the police. it has requested the prime minister to immediately ensure that the faith of the minorities is restored in the police. the information came out during the visit of the commission, including chairman justice mohammad shamim and other members, who met both state governor sundar singh bhandari and chief minister narendra modi on thursday morning. they also heard grievances of the minority community members and visited some relief camps in the city. sources in the state government said the ncm has made several recommendations to the prime minister of which at least one has already been accepted. that equal compensation be given to both the victims of the train attack as well to the next of the kin of those killed in the riots that followed. one of the measures they have suggested to rebuild confidence among people is the government encouraging the creation of peace committees in sensitive parts on the city. the commission members have even gone to the extent of saying that those mohallas which have become ghettos and inaccessible to the government should be handed over to the red cross which would perhaps be more acceptable to the minorities. they have also demanded that composite committees be set up with representations from all walks of life, to survey the damage and decide on compensation. they are against only government officials doing the job because of the mistrust since the riots. because many minority community members are scared of taking treatment in the general hospital, they have recommended starting mobile hospitals, which can go into the affected areas and treat people in their own backyard. it would also like to see the government help doctors, volunteers and ngos who may come forward to help the riot-hit, as the minorities may prefer to deal with such persons in the given circumstances, rather than with the government. on the economic front, the commission would like the state government to direct banks to give soft loans on low interest rates so that small businessmen, shopkeepers and daily-wagers can regain their livelihood, destroyed during the riots. for those who have already taken loans before the riots started, ncm would like banks to waive the interest.	0	0	0	1	0

new delhi: dravidian politics is at a crossroads. probably for the first time after the split in the early 1970s, both the dravidian parties together are supporting a government at the centre. aEUR~aEUR~dravidian politics in the formal sense is overaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm), says political scientist m s s pandian. aEUR~aEUR~of course, the ideas of the dravidian movement still resonate in the dalit movement and in certain feminist groups. but after ayodhya and gujarat, dravidian politics has completely lost its secularism, which was fundamental to its politics, as it flowed from its critique of religion from a rational point of view, rather than holding all religions in equal esteem.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) some say it is the threat of the jail that has kept the dmk leadership with the bjp while another unspoken alliance is being worked out between jayalalithaa and the hindu munnani of the hindutva brigade. so while the bjp has a formal ally that calibrates its responses to ayodhya, it has an informal one that holds annadanam (feasts for the poor) at temples with bjp leaders as invitees. as if underlining this irony, dmk leader and former chief minister m karunanidhi split from the bjp at the state level on sunday, affirming full faith in prime minister vajpayee and praising him as an aEUR~honestaEUR(tm) man. the aiadmk had earlier voted along with the dmk for the prevention of terrorism ordinance here. karunanidhiaEUR(tm)s stand is not very different from union minister ram vilas paswan breaking ties with the nda in bihar. the dmk chief claimed that the local bjp is cosying up with the aiadmk and preferred not to mention the positive turnaround in bjp-aiadmk relations at the centre. according to informed sources, there was some tension in the just concluded dmk general council with karunanidhiaEUR(tm)s son, stalin, seeking a break with the bjp after the attorney generalaEUR(tm)s submission to the supreme court on ayodhya. these sources say union minister murasoli maran prevailed over his critics, forcing karunanidhi to remain within the nda. pandian blames the left parties as much as the two dravidian parties foraEUR~aEUR~communalisation of dravidian politicsaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). according to pandian, aEUR~aEUR~the aiadmk was always pro-hindutva. but the left found certain kind of secularist opportunism in jayalalithaa to form the secular front that has completely withered away in the last couple of months.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm)  Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 15, 2002  new delhi: jagmohan may no longer be union urban development minister but he cannot be wished away. his actions against illegal constructions in tughlaqabad, in delhi development authority (dda) flats and unauthorised colonies still generate passionate discussions among politicians. speaking to the times of india, delhi chief minister sheila dikshit said: aEUR~aEUR~he intended well but demolitions are not the way to solve the cityaEUR(tm)s problem.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) she added: aEUR~aEUR~we have promised to regularise unauthorised colonies that came up till march 2000. an unauthorised colony comes up with the connivance of the land owner, law enforcing agencies and the buyer. demolitions punish only the buyer. the bigger culprits go scot free.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) aEUR~aEUR~it would be wiser to penalise these people and provide them civic amenities. the agencies which allow unauthorised colonies to come up should also be punished. not even elected representatives should be spared,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) she said. speaking on the master plan, she said: aEUR~aEUR~we wanted an amendment in the master plan but jagmohan refused. the master plan is no more sacrosanct than the peopleaEUR(tm)s requirements. i agree with the malhotra committee report on legalising additional constructions. though jagmohan was right in saying that service plans should be strengthened before allowing additional constructions, it could have been done after legalising them.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) about party mla shish palaEUR(tm)s role in encroachments in tughlaqabad, dikshit said: aEUR~aEUR~i did not defend shish pal but said the law should take its own course. i also did not interfere with the investigation against him. but i refused to accept his resignation from a party post on the ground that the charges had not been proved.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) the chief minister also refuted charges levelled by bjp leaders that her party did not approve the delhi statehood bill. dikshit said: aEUR~aEUR~the bjp, which was in power before us, could have passed the bill but did not. it will be impractical to push for full statehood because delhi is the capital city. instead, the delhi government should be given control of the dda and the municipal corporation of delhi (mcd). also, the state government should have a greater say in the national capital region planning board (ncrpb).aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) dikshit said the outcome will be decided not by events like the gujarat riots or ayodhya but by the work done by councillors in the last five years. she said: aEUR~aEUR~people will vote on the basis of whether garbage has been lifted regularly, or property tax has been paid without harassment and whether roads are being constructed and maintained.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) on the congress manifesto, dikshit said: aEUR~aEUR~we want better coordination between the mcd and the delhi government. when we control the corporation, we will strive to provide better governance, introduce a corporate culture and newer technologies. computerising property tax records is high on the agenda.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm)	0	0	0	0	0
"This story is from March 29, 2002  ahmedabad: non-life insurance companies in gujarat may have been hit severely by the communal riots over the past one month. but, the silver lining is the huge increase in awareness for insurance by business and household segments. industry sources say the month of march will be bad for all the four nationalised non-life insurance companies in gujarat. but, from april onwards, a major surge in new covers underwritten will happen in gujarat, according to senior non-life insurance officials. to capitalise on this surge in awareness, the new india assurance co ltd has advertised its householders insurance policy. other insurance companies are also expected to step up their campaign to convert this increased awareness into business. b sundara raman, the regional manager of new india assurance, said that selling insurance is difficult. ""we are selling tears and not dreams, which makes it difficult to convince our potential customers. over the last few years, natural calamities like floods, droughts and the earthquake have hit gujarat. due to this, the awareness for non-life insurance amongst all types of businesses as well as households is much higher in gujarat than in other states. he said the communal riots will act as a further impetus for many to take insurance cover. new india assurance's household insurance policy is over 10 years old. it offers insurance to the property as well as to household goods and domestic appliances in a house or a flat, said raman. r n ghelani, a manager at oriental insurance co, said that all four companies offer householders' insurance policy and a significant increase in business from this segment can be expected from april. ""insurance companies are now cautious about extending new covers for business and trade. new covers for businesses come into effect 15 days after the premium is paid. he said existing policies are being renewed for the same amounts and an increase in cover is generally not being accepted. many of the branches in curfew-bound areas are not functioning and many officers and agents are not able to function due to curfew. but, once normalcy returns, the growth in new business is expected to be very good, said ghelani. so far 3,913 claims worth rs 144 crore have been received by the four companies. new india assurance has got 1,025 claims (rs 33.85 crore), national insurance has 689 claims (rs 41.31 crore), oriental insurance has 973 claims (rs 29 crore) and united india insurance has 1,200 claims (rs 39.24 crore)."	0	0	0	0	0
"new delhi: home minister l k advani recently met senior rss leaders to suggest that its agenda should evolve and grow. party sources said this did not mean abandoning hindutva, but rather looking for a vehicle other than the temple issue to take it forward. there were two reasons for suggesting a change: one, advani feels that the ayodhya issue no longer has the resonance after the destruction of the mosque and the construction of a makeshift temple. two, now that the bjp is in the government, it is too tricky an issue to handle aEUR"" as a party in power, it has to abide by the constitution and the rule of law; as an rss-affiliate, it has to keep sangh members in good humour. the hunt is, therefore, on for an issue. in recent months, the party has toyed with terrorism and poto (prevention of terrorism ordinance). but as an rss source said: aEUR~aEUR~itaEUR(tm)s a good issue. but the problem is that it involves a country which is being supported by the us, and we cannot be seen to be taking a position critical of the us.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) bjp sources added: aEUR~aEUR~we tried it in the recent uttar pradesh elections but it did not work.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) the rss, during its recent pratinidhi sabha, mentioned the common civil code: rss sources said this issue, along with the rssaEUR(tm)s advice to muslims that their security depended on hindu goodwill, could become the subject of a countrywide campaign. the hunt is also on for a strategy to give the party a new look, as it gets into its last two years of this government. party managers are analysing the results of the four assembly elections, and there is widespread speculation that party president k jana krishanamurthy may be replaced by advani. but it is a suggestion which the pm has shot down repeatedly. the pmaEUR(tm)s detractors say he does not want advani to go because he does not want a parallel power centre. others point out that advani does not need to be a full-time party president to keep an eye on the organisation, and that he is, in any case, the partyaEUR(tm)s pointsman for the rss. after the recent polls, the need for a revamp of the party and the government has been felt. if some indication of the first is seen at the partyaEUR(tm)s national executive in april in goa, there could be a major reshuffle of the ministry after the budget session.

new delhi: prime minister vajpayee and home minister advani were targeted in an attack launched against the nda government by congress president sonia gandhi in the lok sabha friday. charging the government with aEUR~aEUR~total ineptitudeaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) and aEUR~aEUR~blatant support to bigoted forcesaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm), she accused the pm and his senior colleagues of conniving with the vhp on ayodhya issue and the gujarat government of complicity in the violence recently. participating in the debate on the motion of thanks to the presidentaEUR(tm)s address, the leader of opposition flayed the government for aEUR~aEUR~comprehensive collapse of governance at the centreaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). referring specifically to the ayodhya issue, sonia said the centreaEUR(tm)s handling of the matter was aEUR~aEUR~shameful to say the leastaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm), adding that the pm and his colleagues did not display the requisite will to deal with the aEUR~aEUR~vhp blackmailaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm)and took a aEUR~aEUR~u turnaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) in the matter as it first asked the state governments to prevent volunteers from going to ayodhya and then gave instructions to provide them police protection. she attributed this somersault to the fact that several bjp mps wrote to the pm on march 7 threatening his government with aEUR~aEUR~dire condequencesaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) if he did not fall in line with their demands. the duplicity of the government, she said, was further exposed through the attorney generalaEUR(tm)s stand on the ayodhya issue in the supreme court although people were made to believe that the pm and his government were neutral. turning to gujarat, sonia gandhi slammed the narendra modi government for its handling of recent violence in the state saying the aEURoecomplicityaEUR of the government in the incidents stood thoroughly exposed. she was particularly critical of home minister advaniaEUR(tm)s reply to the debate on gujarat, stating that much of what he said was at variance with what they saw in the state. she wondered how advani had given a clean chit to the state government and congratulated himself for bringing the situation under control speedily even as gujarat was burning. holding the modi overnment guilty of derelection of its constitutional duties, sonia asserted that the continuance of such an aEURoeirresponsible and callousaEUR government in gujarat was an affront to the countryaEUR(tm)s secular polity while demanding that the judicial probe into the violence be conducted by a sitting judge of the supreme court. soniaaEUR(tm)s thirty-minutes speech, which was heard in pin-drop silence, went on to elaborate the nda governmentaEUR(tm)s failures on other fronts. regarding national security, she said there was aEURoeno evidenceaEUR of a clear-cut strategy on the part of the government on jammu and kashmir even as she lashed out at the pm for re-inducting george fernandes.

"This story is from March 25, 2002  muzaffarpur: nationalist congress party''s national working committee member and former union minister, jagannath mishra, has strongly opposed his party''s central leadership''s decision to support poto bill in the joint session of the parliament, scheduled on tuesday, and openly praised the stand taken by congress president sonia gandhi which, he claimed, was aimed at protecting the nation and its secular structure. talking to newsmen here on monday, mishra disclosed that he has sent a fax message to ncp president sharad pawar, requesting him not to support poto bill. ncp is not a part of nda and, therefore, support to nda on a controversial and ""draconian"" bill is bound to be a suicidal step for ncp, he has warned. clarifying his apprehensions about the possible communal use of poto, he pointed out that the attempt of the gujarat government to use poto only against godhra accused and not against others responsible for killing of 1,000 people in that state, has exposed the intentions of the bjp. mishra brushed aside pawar''s plea that poto exists in a slightly another form of organised crime control act in maharashtra, karnataka and mp. he said he was in total disagreement with his party leadership on this issue. it was strange that the ncp brass had decided to back poto without taking the party working committee into confidence."	0	0	0	0	0
"This story is from March 18, 2002  vadodara: the khaki uniform, the stars and the medals, the lathi and the bayonet, nothing seems to be evoking awe anymore in the people for the police force. the police force has seen a complete erosion in its authority in recent weeks despite rattling off statistics about how many rounds of fire and tear-gas shells it has used against the mobs. as gujarat remains scarred by a series of violent incidents since the godhra carnage, the state police seem to have lost its authority it controlled and also the faith the people had in it. so much so that even 20 days after the riots began, the mobs have no qualms about lynching their victims despite police cover given to them. the erosion of faith perhaps began on day-i itself, when an angry mob went on an assault and stabbing spree at the vadodara railway station on february 27 as the ill-fated sabarmati express chugged in in the evening even as 50 to 60 policemen, including grp, srp and city police personnel, watched. from then onwards, till sunday evening when an escort party of six policemen - three of them armed - virtually stood and watched a mob lynch two persons of the minority community and injure about 20, the image of the police has been on a downslide. says former city police commissioner jaspal singh, who is now with the samajwadi party, ""in this complete break-down of the law and order machinery, the image of the police has got so badly battered that mobs are now killing their victims right in the presence of these men who don''t have a leader left in the police force to inspire them."" ""the escort team was outnumbered by the mob that kept surging and swelling. they did resort to lathi-charge, but to no avail. we were left at the mercy of the mob,"" said an injured person. he was one of the people who had fled their houses in avdhootnagar in makarpura area of vadodara after february 28 and had returned to collect their belongings when the mob attacked. and, the aggrieved now cut across communities. if a mob comprising women from the minority community gheraoed vadodara police commissioner d d tuteja on ajwa road on sunday, a huge group of women took to the streets on saturday afternoon despite curfew, singing ram dhun and protesting police excesses on the menfolk of the salatwada area. two women were injured when the police had to burst tear-gas shells to disperse them. the lawlessness that gripped vadodara was also apparent when a group of tribals fired at the district collector and district superintendent of police recently when they on a round in kawant taluka. what has further dented the police''s image is the interference by the political class, with bjp functionaries being seen at a number of places, ""guiding"" policemen on the street on ""how and where to act"". and, the ram dhun singing crowds too, were virtually left untamed on friday. they meandered menacingly close to known sensitive areas and the policemen on duty did not act despite their provocative slogans that triggered fresh bouts of rioting last friday."	0	0	1	1	1
"This story is from March 25, 2002  vadodara: a group of human rights activists, which toured ahmedabad and godhra, demanded a cbi inquiry on sunday into the godhra incident and the riots that followed. the group included kuldip nayar, who was representing human rights for south asians, and zafar saifullah of the movement for empowerment of indian muslims. alleging that the state government was ""not equipped enough"" to handle an inquiry into an event of this magnitude, nayar said that a cbi inquiry was necessary. bsp leader arif mohammad khan was also accompanying the team. the team will prepare a report within a week. ""from our observations, we feel that what happened in godhra was planned. and, what happened later, in a larger scale, was also planned. and, the planning was done at a higher level. it is also clear that whoever planned it had some political ends at sight and wanted to implement a political agenda. it was deliberate and a conspiratorial effort,"" said nayar, adding that ""till the chief minister is around, there cannot be peace."" ""the builders of our nation wanted to weave a fabric where everyone was a hindustani and where everyone fought together whether be it a social or economic cause. they wished to keep the state and religion separate. in gujarat, there was a deliberate effort to destroy this fabric,"" he said. zafar saifullah too hinted at a ""bigger plan, arranged in a big way"". ""it was meticulously planned, training imparted and targets identified. there was a think tank and there was a group that implemented the plan and the mastermind must be someone who wields lots of power,"" he said. calling the killings a calculated genocide, he said that the riots could not be a spontaneous reaction. ""the effect on the economy will be tremendous. the economic consequences of the riots will be massive,"" he said. according to arif mohammed khan, gujarat chief minister narendra modi''s reference to newton''s law in justifying the riots that followed the godhra incident was wrong.

"This story is from March 15, 2002  gandhinagar: at least 300 villages of jamnagar and kutch districts are likely to face water crisis this summer, as the ongoing work on the rs 400-crore drinking water pipeline from saurashtra branch of narmada canal has run into trouble following unexpected technical reasons in completion of the project. it is learnt that 500 mld of mahi waters were to reach jamnagar and its surroundings, and kutch by april 15 through the pipeline project undertaken by gujarat water supply and sewerage board, but a major problem of salinity ingress has cropped up in the canal lining work in surendranagar district from where the pipeline is passing. this has been a cause of worry for the board officials. though there is adequate drinking water stored in irrigation dams of saurashtra and kutch region, the ongoing project has run into trouble as a big stretch of at least 30-35 km needs to be protected through lining of tiles in lieu of conventional cement and concrete lining. according to reliable sources, 29 lakh tiles are required for the lining of the big stretch in surendranagar district but so far only three lakh tiles have been used for the canal lining work. ""and, with this slow pace, it will not be possible for the contractors to finish the work by the deadline of april 15,"" commented a senior government official on condition of anonymity. baffled by this bottleneck, the board officials have started consulting experts to overcome this problem, which would be time consuming unless some alternative is found. except this work, all other ancillary works including three falls to be created in surendranagar district are in full swing. at least 45 mw of power will be generated through these falls. the work for installation of powerful pumps is also in progress. the pumps will run round the clock at dholi dhaja dam, leading to consumption of 110 mw of power. the pipeline structure for the project is almost ready but for the pending lining work. the fate of the project is hanging in balance unless some technical solution was found out by technocrats. meanwhile, the state irrigation officials are confident that there is adequate water stored in dams of saurashtra and kutch and so there won''t be a grave drinking water crisis as was experienced last year. as compared to last year''s 40 mcm storage in saurashtra dams, the current storage is four times more - 170 mcm. in kutch region, the existing storage is around 35 mcm as against 12 in the corresponding period last year. as many as 42 irrigation dams in gujarat region has storage of 3,200 mcm as against 1,900 mcm last year. while confirming this, state irrigation secretary m s patel told tnn that there won''t be any serious drinking water crisis this year.

This story is from March 29, 2002  mumbai: gujarat chief minister narendra modi in an exclusive interview to the times of india says his state is returning to normalcy. excerpts from the interview.in your view, was the burning of 58 kar sevaks in the sabarmati express at godhra a planned attacked or a spontaneous one? was there an untoward incident on the station platform which sparked the attack?if one looks at the nature of the heinous attack on the sabarmati express and the manner in which 58 innocent kar sevaks were burnt alive in a compartment of the ill-fated train, it would be apparent that it was a deep rooted conspiracy and a pre-planned, cold-blooded attack.the train arrived at godhra at 7:43 a.m. and within five minutes, i.e. at 7:48 a.m., it left godhra. it was stopped at signal falia about 500 metres away and a mob attacked the compartment collectively. how can such an attack be spontaneous? moreover, the train departed from faizabad and arrived in godhra after 36 long hours, and no incident was reported on the behaviour of the kar sevaks en route. but the president of the gujarat unit of the congress, amarsinh chaudhary, has alleged in a television interview that the attack took place because the kar sevaks did not pay money for a cup of tea at the railway station. is it not ridiculous to justify a ghastly incident such as this?there are reports that the tableegi jamiat of the deobandi school of islam has been fanning fundamentalist ideology in godhra and that there were instances of members of the majority community being burnt in the past few years. are these reports true? if so, on what dates were they burned and by whom and what is the action taken against the persons concerned?the long history of communal violence in godhra is not an unknown phenomenon, but it has taken an ugly and serious turn in the last 25-30 years. two families have been burnt alive in the same area in the past in a ghastly incident. and ten years ago, four teachers, including two women teachers, were mercilessly cut to death in a school in the presence of children.while the then congress rulers have registered court cases in a routine manner, they have failed miserably to punish the real culprits. not only this, the main culprit named asaraf was done to death while in a jail by other accused persons and the whole event was pushed into a corner forever.reports of the violence in ahmedabad give the impression that it was well organised. the reports said armed mobs went around with voting lists targeting muslims. an ias officer, harsh mander, has given a chilling account of the violence in ahmedabad. why has the state not been able to tackle the situation? there are allegations that the police was partisan. please comment.those who are acquainted with gujarat know that this state is very sensitive to communal violence. there have been serious communal disturbances triggered by petty and minor incidents relating to kite flying or a cricket match. in the past, communal violence has broken out in 200 places at a time and curfew has been imposed in about 300 villages and towns for months together.compared to this, the godhra massacre was unparalleled in history, but we took all proactive measures to curb the violence within 72 hours. the police fired more than 3,900 rounds initially and the army was airlifted from the border area and deployed within 16 hours in the disturbed areas. there was no complacency on the part of the government or the police.even now the situation doesn''t seem to be under control. what is the reason for this?there are about 18,000 villages in the state, of which disturbances were reported in no more than 50 villages. of the 242 municipal towns in the state, incidents took place in less than 40 towns. after march 3, no major incidents of violence have been reported. not only this, religious rituals were observed on the eve of holi in all 18,000 villages in a peaceful manner, while moharrum was observed with tazia processions at more than 1,000 places. ten lakh students have appeared in the ssc\hsc examinations and the process of village panchayat elections is going on in a peaceful manner in about 1,700 villages.lakhs of pilgrims are on padyatras to reach dakor yatradham for the full moon day celebrations and in palitana, a famous jain pilgrim centre, lakhs of jain families are coming in from far-off areas. even in ambaji in north gujarat, thousands of pilgrims have come together for prayers. does this not suggest peace and normalcy in the state?there are allegations that you have moved out police officers who took a tough stance against the rioters. please comment.again, this is a false and misconceived allegation. the issue of promotions of police officers was long pending and it was purely an administrative decision. there was absolutely no political motive in the transfers of officers. those who are indulging in false propaganda are only damaging the morale of the forces.do you think that a section of the bjp itself is behind the campaign for your removal?i am getting unequivocal support from all the bjp workers and leaders of the state. they have been a constant source of encouragement and inspiration for my government''s fight against terrorist and anti-social activities. i am committed to protecting the people of gujarat. the talk of internal bickering is baseless and mischievous.is it true that you are in favour of mid-term elections in gujarat?it is unfortunate that when my entire focus as a leader of the state is to provide relief to all those who have been affected, such issues are being raised. my sole concern today is to bring total normalcy to my state and to create an atmosphere of mutual trust and harmony. in this grave period, i do not have any time to think of any political activity.two of your ministers are reported to have been in the ahmedabad police control room when the riots broke out in ahmedabad. what action do you plan against them?it has always been a tradition in this state for senior ministers to monitor and coordinate the rescue and relief measures from the control rooms. this is treated as a routine and regular exercise. during the earthquake, ministers were actively coordinating the relief activities from the police control room. i feel distressed to see that this also is being twisted by the media, with the sole objective of maligning my government.related storiesA low key holi in gujaratA violence continues in central gujarat  	0	0	1	0	1

"jaipur: newly-elected rajya sabha member from rajasthan natwar singh on wednesday asked the vajpayee government to arrest gujarat chief minister narendra modi under poto if the centre really wanted to implement the anti-terrorism law in toto. the modi government was responsible for violence and killings in the aftermath of godhra mayhem and it was surprising that the centre had not taken any action against him so far, singh told mediapersons here. on his victory in rajya sabha biennial polls, he claimed the bjp legislature party in the state was divided into two groups-one led by former chief minister b s shekhawat and second by ram das agarwal, a retiring rajya sabha member. the state bjp apprehended cross-voting and could not formulate its poll strategy and, therefore, withdrew an independent candidate supported by it, singh said. he claimed seven independents, 2 bsp and an rjd mla had cast votes in favour of congress. on prime minister atal bihari vajpayee''s rejecting congress president sonia gandhi''s charge that he was working under pressure of sangh parivar during the debate on poto in parliament, singh said the leader of the oppositon in parliament has every right to ask the prime minister on matters relating to public. it was ""utter frustration"" on part of the prime minister, he said.

This story is from March 19, 2002  lucknow: president of the minorities forum of india and samajwadi party mla azam khan slammed the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh and other pro-hindutva outfits for the intemperate language being used for muslims and said it was part of a pre-designed plan to create a sense of terror among them. he demanded that a debate should be held in parliament on why hindus and muslims could not live together and, if the anti-muslim stance of these organizations were allowed to continue, where exactly the muslims were to go and live. addressing a press conference, khan said the recent statement of the rss that if the muslims had to live here they would have to win the goodwill of the majority community and the earlier statements of the prime minister and bharatiya janata party leaders regarding the minority community were aimed at insulting and launching a pre-planned hit campaign against them. he said the time had come for the state to decide if the vishwa hindu parishad was the representative of the entire hindu community. citing the case of godhra and the recent happenings in ayodhya, the sp mla said the central theme in all of them was the babri mosque and reiterated that the question of giving up the babri mosque did not arise. he said the babri mosque should be treated as the check point and if the government failed on this count the day was not far when nothing would prevent the country from disintegrating. khan said while the muslims were willing to adhere to the court verdict it had now become necessary not to restrict the movement to the court alone. the time had come to make the people aware of the actual issue, he added. khan said he had demanded the setting up of a special court for the godhra incident with a fixed timeframe of one month, but the government had not heeded to his view point. referring to the attack on the orissa assembly, he said it was ironical that those who attacked parliament were termed terrorists and those who did the same in orissa were dubbed desh bhakts and no action was taken against them. khan said it was another proof of the bharatiya janata partyaEUR(tm)s doublespeak. on the plan to implead the central government in the ayodhya case, the sp mla said it was a welcome step as the stand of the government on the issue would become clear.	0	0	0	1	0

This story is from March 15, 2002  mumbai: while pulling up the centre for not taking the nda allies into confidence on the ayodhya issue, shiv sena chief bal thackeray on thursday ruled out the possibility of the downfall of the atal behari vajpayee government on the issue. the nda allies are upset, but the mps are not in favour of a midterm poll. this government may continue to hobble on,'' the sena chief said while addressing a press conference at his suburban residence. the government at the centre is made up of several allies and the bjp ought to have consulted its partners in the nda on the matter. you need a government with a comfortable majority in the lok sabha to take an unequivocal stand on policy issues.this not being the case in the present era of coalition politics, the centre will have to weigh every move before taking a final decision,'' mr thackeray said summing up, as if, the dilemma of the vajpayee government. stating that the present situation in mumbai was unlike'' the one in 1992, mr thackeray hinted that his party was in no mood to ignite trouble in the city in the wake of the vhp's call for 'puja'. the sena chief, however, urged the centre to take a firm stand on the ayodhya issue and to out be swayed by the compulsions of electoral politics. the centre should request the courts to expedite the long-standing case by taking it up on a daily basis, thus clearing the decks for a final solution to the contentious issue, mr thackeray stated in reply to a question. he said the sena supported the vhp's plans for the symbolic 'shila-pujan' on the undisputed site in ayodhya on friday.we don't need permission from anyone to perform the 'puja'. it is our birthright,'' he declared, adding, we have strong evidence to prove our claim that there was a ram temple at the disputed site earlier.'' however, the sena chief refrained from offering his views on the supreme court's wednesday verdict on l'affaire ayodhya. the godhra carnage was a well-planned operation'', he said. asked about the mediatory role performed by the shankaracharya of the kanchi kama koti peetham, mr thackeray said the seer's efforts should not have been viewed through the prism of politics. but it has been turned into a political issue,'' he remarked.	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 29, 2002  mumbai: satish sahney, who was mumbai''s police commissioner from november 1993 to november 1995, is widely credited as the man responsible for applying the healing touch to the city after the communal riots of 1992-''93, which were followed by the serial blasts in march 1993. in the backdrop of the recent gujarat violence, he explains how he put the police-muslim relationship on an even keel. excerpts from an interview:what were the conditions like when you took over as mumbai police commissioner?the two communities were never so divided as they were in 1993. police credibility was at its lowest, particularly among the muslims. they were not willing to even take a complaint to the police, which is a very dangerous situation.what steps did you take to improve the situation?soon after i took over, i started a direct dialogue with constables. my thrust was: you have lost the trust of the people and unless you take the initiative the situation will not remedy automatically. i would visit police stations and the point i sought to drive home in every meeting was, `do you feel satisfied about a situation in which a sizeable section of the citizenry views you as partisan and people feel that your decisions are based on your religion and not on your training or on your allegiance to the constitution?'' i used to implore the constables that once they donned the police uniform, they had no caste, no creed and that they had to deal with people as those who break the law and those who abide by it.what kind of response did you get from the constables?initially, i used to get very little response because constables are not used to this sort of an exercise. but gradually, i found that they were becoming aware of the fact that they were being targetted for being partisan. the issue is of sending the right signals. all said and done, the indian police looks up to its leadership; the moment policemen know that the chief wants work to be done the way it should be done they fall in line. but if the leader is not clear in his thinking then things can go wrong. how did you go about bridging the communication gap between the police and the citizens?reaching the people was a more difficult exercise. fortunately for me, julio ribeiro returned to the city in april 1994 and teamed up with sushobha barve of the moral rearmament army who was active in the restoration of peace. they had a lengthy discussion with my men and we decided to initiate a dialogue with the aggrieved people. the first meeting was held in a mahim school with a group of 20 well-educated muslims. for nearly three hours we just listened to some very angry people. i had some idea of the intensity of their feelings but some of their statements were very provocative; they had come to the conclusion that the exercise was an eyewash. yet, we kept our cool.three days later, there was another meeting at mahim with another set of muslims. this meeting, too, stretched for three hours but the hostility was much lesser, the anger that used to show on their faces was absent. the third meeting, again at mahim, was exclusively with women. it was here that i first spoke out; i told them that i had not come to defend what had happened, my purpose was to ensure that such things would never happen again. for this, i needed their support. finally, it registered with the muslims that we were not being superficial.so, merely hearing out the aggrieved people helped you establish a rapport?what helped in changing the hard attitude of the people was that we allowed them to unburden themselves. from our side, we did not use a harsh word nor did we try to put them in their place. it has been my experience all through my police career that if you give a patient hearing to a man who has come with a grievance and allow him to unburden himself, quite a lot of his bitterness and anger goes away. you may not be able to do much because of legal constraints or procedural requirements, but that you gave him a patient hearing and allowed him to speak out without bullying him makes a big change in that person''s attitude.did you make amend the police functioning in any way as a result of the interaction at mahim?one of the complaints that the women had was that during any bandobust or festival, the police would routinely pick up all the young boys in the locality and lock them up for a day in the name of preventive detention. i assured them that not one person without a criminal record would ever betouched.how did you manage such productive interaction in communally sensitive localities all over the city?like sushobha, there were others, such as p.p. jamkhedkar in behrampada and bhau korde in dharavi, who had taken the initiative to restore peace in their localities. these people were instrumental in making the meetings possible. and it was at these meetings that the concept of mohalla committees emerged.how are your mohalla committees different from the earlier ones, which had worked wonders in bhiwandi?in the bhiwandi model, the police created and led the mohalla committees. our mohalla committees were people''s organisations. the informal leader of each mohalla committee is an apolitical person who has some standing in the area. he is the one who convenes the meeting, not the local police. the mohalla committee has no structure and no one gets any identity cards; these are just a bunch of citizens respected by the local police.did the police support mohalla committees just because you happened to be the commissioner?that must have helped, but the sub-inspectors and inspectors also realised that without public support their work would become very difficult in a big city like mumbai. at that time the inspectors were conscious of the fact that they were not being trusted by the muslim community and it rankled in their minds. hence, they were also willing to accept this principle of a partnership between the community and the police. mohalla committees basically brought citizens together to tackle their problems. at places the work of mohalla committee became so effective that the police station was willing to let them handle some minor matters.  	0	1	1	0	0

new delhi: the day after. the vhp is happy despite the mounting dissatisfaction of the kar sewaks who feel let down by their parent organisation. not so for the vhp. aEUR~aEUR~after the opening of the temple locks in february 1985, and the shila nayas ceremony later, this is the first time the central government has accepted in principle that the ram temple will be constructed at the disputed site only and not on the acquired land,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says praveen togadia, vhpaEUR(tm)s international general secretary. the fact that the prime ministeraEUR(tm)s ayodhya cell chief shatrughan singh has personally accepted the - on behalf of the government - from mahant paramhans, has been interpreted to mean that aEUR~aEUR~the indian state has agreed in principle that the mandir will be constructed at the site where the make-shift temple is at the moment,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he says happily. what does the man in the muddle have to say about the role he was called upon to play in the ayodhya imbroglio? while shatrughan singh, the prime ministeraEUR(tm)s special emissary entrusted with the role of receiving the shila at the vhpaEUR(tm)s shila daan ceremony, prefers to maintain silence, sources close to him say the low-profile bureaucrat is not a happy man today. first, because he had no say in the matter and was arbitrarily pushed into the field without prior notice. second, because this was hardly the role he had envisaged for himself as chief of the ayodhya cell in the cabinet secretariat. singh was cast in this role, scripted by the vhp leadership, at the last minute after late night telephonic-exchanges between vajpayee, l k advani and paramhans on march 14. he was merely put on the flight and asked to do the needful in ayodhya, no questions asked. did he have a choice? aEUR~aEUR~not really, if he wanted to keep his job,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says a source in the pmo. ironically, even though he headed the ayodhya cell, singh figured nowhere in the negotiations between the kanchi shankaracharya and the all india muslim personal law board. in the high political drama, last fortnight, it was sudheendra kulkarni, osd in the pmo, who was the master of ceremonies, sources point out. this naturally added to singhaEUR(tm)s pique. pmo sources say that the vhp had specifically asked for singhaEUR(tm)s services for three reasons. one, as divisional commissioner of faizabad till february last year, he knew most their leaders. two, the vhp were unwilling to accept the shilas from the present commissioner, a k gupta, who they felt was hostile to their cause. but most importantly, by getting singh to receive the pillars, the vhp would be able to obtain the centreaEUR(tm)s seal of approval to the temple construction in ayodhya, strengthening their case in the future. was this senior administrative officer comfortable with the role thrust upon him? there are many in the bureaucracy willing to jump to singhaEUR(tm)s defence. aEUR~aEUR~anyone who watched him go through the rites like a robot would be in no doubt that he was not exactly enjoying the job,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says a up bureaucrat. adds another, aEUR~aEUR~when it comes to hogging the limelight, politicians are forever ready, but for something as controversial as shila puja or shila daan, it is attorney generals and bureaucrats who are called upon to be the sacrificial lamb.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm)    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 18, 2002  lucknow: putting up brave face to keep the ram temple movement alive, the vishwa hindu parishad has given broad hints to withdraw the undertaking given to the centre, which says the vhp and the ram janambhoomi nyas will abide by the supreme court verdict on the ayodhya case. aEURoethe undertaking has lost its relevance after kanchi seer jayendra sarswatiaEUR(tm)s formula failed to take off,aEUR stated rajendra singh pankaj, vhp joint secretary. the vhp leader claimed that the undertaking to the centre was conditional and was given only for implementation of jayendra saraswatiaEUR(tm)s formula to defuse ayodhya crisis, but the formula was rejected by the all-india muslim personal law board on march 10. aEURoeno formula no undertakingaEUR seems to be the mood in the vhp camp as all its leaders are changing track after facing wrath of ram sevaks after march 15 climbdown on aEUR~shila daanaEUR(tm) programme. rjn chairman mahant ramchandradas paramhans, who had resolved to abide by the march 13 supreme court verdict, has changed his tone, too. aEURoehow can i accept court verdict against temple construction after fighting the case for over 50 years?aEUR asked paramhans. firebrand bjp mp vinay katiar is of the opinion that ram temple is a question of faith and in matters of faith courts have limited role to play. aEURoewhen religious sentiments are involved, courts should avoid any intervention,aEUR he commented. the bjp mp, who had played an active role in defusing the situation in ayodhya on march 15, quoted a few judgments of the courts which were not followed as public sentiments were deeply hurt. aEURoethe issue can never be resolved through the courts of law. serious negotiations have to be started again to settle the dispute amicably. if courts decide the case, the judgment will hurt the feelings of members of the loser community and the dispute will go on,aEUR reasoned katiar. significantly, the undertaking given to the centre was not signed by the rjn chairman paramhans. in fact, the mahant had distanced himself from the saraswati formula and had refused to sign the undertaking when talks were on in delhi in second week of march. it was the vhp working president ashok singhal who had to sign the undertaking in the capacity of rjn managing trustee. aEURoethe undertaking has no legal standing as only rjn chairman (mahant paramhans) is authorised to sign it,aEUR quips a vhp functionary. the issue to withdraw the undertaking had come up for discussion during a high-level meeting of vhp office-bearers at karsevakpuram on saturday. chaired by ashok singhal, the meeting was attended by acharya giriraj kishore, rajendra singh pankaj, purshottam narain singh, champat rai, dharminder dwivedi and others. a senior state vhp leader disclosed that it was decided during the meeting that since the undertaking given to the centre had no relevance now, it should be withdrawn. aEURoewe will be forwarding a letter to the centre in this regard soon,aEUR claimed the leader.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 15, 2002  mumbai: india's first satellite designed and produced by amateur radio operators is slated for launch by the indian space research organisation's (isro) polar satellite launch vehicle in two years, space agency sources have said. designated as 'vusat', the project was firmed up in january 2001.the team which is designing the satellite has held a series of meetings with isro officials in the past few months who have responded favourably to the plan. the amateur group has also visited sriharikota near chennai, which is india's main space launch complex. an official connected with the project said, the meeting in january 2001 was significant because some of the brains in india's amateur satellite scene came together to define the configuration of the satellite and form teams which will work on the hardware.'' the sources said that the satellite, which is expected to be ready next year, will be mainly used by ham operators. in plain terms, hams are those who run amateur radio stations. during the past few years hams have played an important role in transmitting important messages, especially during national crises, like the killer quake in gujarat last year. indian hams, numbering nearly 20,000, have been planning their own satellite since the launch of the country's first indigenously-made satellite, 'aryabhatta', on july 19, 1975 from russia. but for different reasons the project did not see fruition. in the absence of their own satellite, they had to be content with operating through the orbiting satellite carrying amateur radio (oscar), which is a foreign one. but the hams did not give up. now their own satellite is steadily taking shape.the design and fabrication of this satellite assumes significance in the light of isro encouraging the development of micro satellites by private parties, particularly universities. it may be recalled that last month isro joined hands with the chennai-based anna university for the development of a micro-satellite weighing 60 kg. at a workshop jointly organised by the astronautical society of india and anna university in chennai last saturday, isro chairperson k. kasturirangan said in his message that advances in space technologies--in particular micro-electronics, lightweight elements and propulsion systems--have enabled the realisation of micro satellites having adequate capabilities for different types of missions.'' one of the main advantages of micro satellites is that they call for simpler ground operations. sources said that interest in small satellites, weighing between 10 and 100 kgs, has been growing rapidly all over the world with business houses, governments and universities starting their own projects. a good example of a small satellite is the 100-kg 'lunarsat', which has been proposed to the european space agency by a consortium of european universities and industries.with a race to the moon currently on in several countries, the primary aim of this mission is to obtain data of the south polar lunar region to explore the possibility of setting up a human outpost.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 19, 2002  surat: though surat has remained relatively trouble-free in the post-godhra frenzy, the public is still cautious in charting out travel plans. though it is perceived that the average surti has a higher disposable income and international tours rank fairly high as the most preferred way to holiday, the trend has hit a low again. the travel bug was affected last year when the world trade centre in the us was attacked. many deferred their international holidays and preferred to go the domestic way instead. now, travel agents are reporting lesser enquiries on both domestic and international tours. but if there was a feeling that people would move out of the city in droves fearing more communal clashes, then that is clearly not the case. but the fervour and enthusiasm associated with planning one''s holidays has definitely lost its charm for the time being. meenakshi vaghela, associated with a travel agency in the city, told tnn that the enquiries have declined. while the months of january and february were good to begin with, business has gone down by nearly 40 per cent compared to last year. dinesh patel of falcon holidays too has a similar story. the number of enquiries has dropped to a mere 20 per cent of what is expected. the international as well as domestic tours which were finalised earlier in february have been cancelled and more cancellations are coming up, said a travel agent in the city''s nanpura area. people prefer to remain inside their homes rather than venturing out, he feels. though the fear of communal clashes does exist among the residents, the fear of travelling has taken an even firmer grip on people. stories about trains running empty and mobs touring the highways have affected travel plans by road and rail. the summer holidays, which were usually planned well in advance, have been put off because of the uncertainty that was surrounding the board exam schedule, feel both vaghela and patel. but joy thakkar, the secretary of the travel agents'' association of south gujarat is upbeat as he says that even if peace prevails for two more weeks, the losses can be made up. he acknowledges that domestic tours have been affected by at least 30 to 40 per cent. while international tours have not been affected as much, they may get a fillip since the international airlines have some new schemes in the offing to be implemented by april 1 this year, he said.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 30, 2002  hyderabad: the criticism of the vajpayee-led nda-government at the centre by different sections over the enactment of prevention of terrorism act (pota) notwithstanding, former union law minister ram jethmalani supported the act saying that aEURoeit will prevent a majority of the people from committing crimeaEUR. aEURoethe draconian provisions incorporated in the law will keep the moderates away from the path of terrorism,aEUR jethmalani said. brushing aside contention that pota would be misused the same way as tada was, he said such interpretations of the act were misleading. aEURoeno criminal law in the country was able to totally eradicate crime. but, despite having draconian provisions, acts like pota will act on the sub-conscious of the wavering majority and prevent them from taking to criminal ways,aEUR he said in the defence of the controversial act. participating in a meet-the-press programme organised by the ap union of working journalists (apuwj) on sunday, the controversial jurist, however, admitted that the act could be misused and a glaring example of this is the arrest of yasin malik in srinagar a couple of days ago. aEURoea woman was found with dollars and carrying dollars is not an offence. but, still she was arrested,aEUR he said. jethmalani, always in the news for taking up cases like defending the case of indira gandhiaEUR(tm)s assasinators, also affirmed that he told union home minister l k advani that aEURoehe would make the life of the government miserableaEUR if any case of misuse of pota is sighted. on the misuse of tada, he said that the act was used against the innocents due to the lack of strength of character on the part of the law enforcement agencies who acted as puppets of the political masters in-charge. hence, he suggested constitution of a monitoring group on the reports of pota misuse and expressed willingness to constitute teams of lawyers in the areas where the act is likely to be misused to offer free services to the innocents. aEURoethe misuse of pota can be prevented by a sensitive judiciary, vigilant press and necessary legislations,aEUR he said. supporting the enactment of the pota, he said that the act was necessary in view of the high degree of sophistication achieved by the terrorist outfits. aEURoenobody ever dreamed that bin ladenaEUR(tm)s al-qaeda will destroy the american structures using its own instruments. it is now an established fact that the terrorist outfit has a wide-spread network throughout the world and i have no doubt that our country also has the pockets of influence,aEUR he said, adding it is in the context, the godhra carnage which resulted in the death of several innocent people should be understood. he observed that perpetrators of the godhra massacre knew that there would be retaliation which would lead to suffering of both the majority and minority communities. aEURoewhoever had done that were not the friends of islam or muslims, but only wanted to create chaos in the country by striking terror among innocents. aEURoethe vajpayee government has earned marks for its foreign policy for neutralising pakistanaEUR(tm)s designs. but the reputation of the country has suffered because of the gujarat incidents,aEUR he said. on the ayodhya issue, jethmalani said that the demolition of the mosque was tragic and it constituted a criminal offence, besides being inconsistent with the ethos of the country. aEURoethe whole controversy surrounding the temple issue is a futile one,aEUR he said.	0	1	1	0	0

"This story is from March 18, 2002  ahmedabad: the bjp in the state is on the horns of a dilemma. the party does not know whether to press for an early assembly election to derive political mileage out of the current perceived pro-hindutva wave. political observers feel that since the bjp government, headed by chief minister narendra modi, has ordered postponement of municipal elections for a period of three months ""on the grounds of deteriorated law and order situation,"" it would be difficult to go for a snap poll. the central leadership of the party is now busy with the ayodhya crisis and it seems that it is not in a hurry to contemplate over the proposal for fresh elections in gujarat at this stage. however, a majority of the senior leaders are of the opinion that the government should seek the leadership''s permission to hold elections as the atmosphere in the state is in favour of the saffron brigade as was never before in past four years. ""the bjp, which suffered heavily following its debacle in almost all the bye-elections in the past two years, is likely to be benefited in the changed circumstances,"" a source said. but on the other hand, prime minister atal behari vajpayee, who is annoyed with the state leadership, has already indicated in new delhi that elections in the state would be held only as per the schedule. vajpayee has conveyed this to a delegation of the opposition parties which had called on him to discuss the issue of communal violence. meanwhile, the state leadership is stunned by vajpayee''s announcement in new delhi that a state-level committee, headed by the governor, would be constituted to supervise the relief camps in ahmedabad. the announcement is perhaps spurred by the complaints of discrimination levelled by the opposition leaders against the government, mainly in the supply of essential commodities to riot victims. however, a senior minister said the decision was taken only after consultation with chief minister modi. in another development, some senior ministers and party leaders have been dispatched to various parts of the state to make an on-the-spot assessment of the present situation. state health minister ashok bhatt will make an assessment of central gujarat, while finance minister nitin patel would submit a report on north gujarat. agriculture minister purshottam roopala and urban development minister i k jadeja would be in charge of the saurashtra region.

for gandhi, these were not just issues to be discussed at times of disturbances, but goals to be pursued constantly. his own prayer meetings were never conducted in temples, mosques or churches, but under the sky. and they always included elements from different religions. or take his 1934 movement against untouchability during which he covered 12,000 milesaEUR""meeting groups of villagers day after day, and explaining that there was no justification for denying a fellow human being access to roads, temples or wells. leaders like sardar patel sometimes complained that he was diverting attention from the national movement. but gandhi always replied, aEURoeyou cannot postpone every problem to after independence.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) the orthodox elements often opposed him, but gandhi always invited them onto the dais to express their views. one man in particular was very abusive and, once when gandhi was absent, the villagers beat him up. gandhi went on a weekaEUR(tm)s fast as penance and told his followers, aEURoethat man has every right to express his opinions.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) this, to me, demonstrates his approach to dialogue and conflict resolution. is there anything we can learn from these strategies? the whole world today recognises the need for non-violent conflict resolution. there are 350 university departments and learned bodies around the globeaEUR""not just in countries like the u.s. and the uk, but in places like latvia and finlandaEUR""which are devoted to this subject. they study gandhi as the prophet of non-violence, the man who turned a personal ethic into a tool of social and political action. but, strangely, universities and academics in india tend to ignore him. why do you feel that indians have forgotten gandhi? let me ask you one simple question. gandhiaEUR(tm)s autobiography used to cost rs 2, now it costs rs 20. how many people do you know who own a copy? as far as most educated, english-speaking people are concerned, gandhi was a political leader, someone who brought freedom to the country and deserves reverence on october 2. they donaEUR(tm)t see how much his life and principles still apply. if gandhi were alive today, he would have said, aEURoeunderstand me, donaEUR(tm)t praise me.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) but this is precisely what we have failed to do. why is gandhi so relevant today? i recently read a book by howard gardner which identifies the seven geniuses of the 20th century aEUR""einstein, t.s. eliot, freud, stravinsky, picasso, martha graham and gandhi. the author contends that geniuses are people who solve not only the problems of their own time, but also foresee future problems. all the major issues of todayaEUR""from religious tolerance to ecological devastationaEUR""were foreseen by gandhi at the beginning of the 20th century. and he had something relevant and practical to say about each of them. unlike marx, whose principles were framed in a library, gandhiaEUR(tm)s principles were framed in the context of life. take his attitude towards religion. before embarking on his journey through riot-torn noakhali in 1946, gandhi needed a secretary who could speak bengali and he requested n.k. bose, the eminent anthropologist. bose declined, saying, aEURoei wonaEUR(tm)t be able to work for you because i donaEUR(tm)t believe in god.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) to which gandhi replied, aEURoeyou believe in truth donaEUR(tm)t you? that is good enough for me.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) what prompted you to begin your 50-year-long quest for gandhi? on january 30, 1948, i was a civil servant with the railways, and was posted at the border town of ferozepur. as a student in lahore, i had never been an uncritical admirer of gandhi, but when i heard the news that he had been shot dead, i found myself crying inconsolably. aEURoehow did this man get into my bloodstream?aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) i wondered.the very next day, i went to the bookstore at ferozepur and bought every single book about gandhi and the freedom struggle. and that day began my search for gandhi."	0	0	1	0	0
"lucknow: the allahabad high court on wednesday ordered a day-to-day hearing of the ram janambhoomi-babri masjid title suit and said the recording of the testimony of the witnesses will be done either by the lucknow bench or through a commission.       read this story in...          A A hindi    the lucknow bench of the high court comprising justice sudhir narayan, justice s r alam and justice bhanwar singh passed these orders on a petition by the centre requesting the court to order a daily hearing of the matter. the special full bench, while disposing of the centre''s petition, held that the proposed commission would take note of the objections filed against the documentary evidence and later refer them to the court for a decision without stopping the recording of the evidence and statement of the witnesses. the court was giving its order on a petition by the centre pleading for a day-to-day hearing to facilitate a speedy disposal of the ayodhya title suit. by allowing the commission to record the evidence and statement of witnesses when the bench was not available, the court has paved the way for a daily hearing of the case. the court also recalled it had passed an order on july 12 last year that the recording of the evidence should be done on a day-to-day basis. the court observed after that order. evidence could not be recorded on a day-to-day basis by the bench for one reason or other. ""recording of evidence on a day-to-day basis is possible only when it is recorded by the commission on the date when this bench is not holding the court,"" the judges said. one of the objections raised against the recording of the evidence through the commission was that in case of any objection against the documentary evidence or in respect of any question, the evidence could not be further recorded till the objection was decided, it said. to cope with such a situation, the special bench citing an apex court judgement, said the recording of evidence and statement of the witnesses shall continue even in case of objections, which could be referred to court for a decision later. related stories:A vhp may defer temple deadline    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0
shabana azmi there is no denying that india has been a victim of terrorism, including cross-border terror propagated by pakistan for more than a decade now. hence, terrorism needs to be rooted out. but i am convinced the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), a draconian law, is impinging on our civil liberties and secular polity. like its predecessor tada, it will be misused. the conviction rate of tada arrests is a shocking 1.8 per cent. out of the 77,571 people arrested under tada, over 2000 were let off without trial because no evidence was found against them. surely, our fears that poto will be similarly misused should be addressed. instead we have home minister l k advani saying, aEUR~aEUR~those who oppose poto favour terrorism.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) this shocking statement is like us president george bush announcing after september 11, in a cowboy style, aEUR~aEUR~either you are with us or with them (terrorists).aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) we are with neither. let this be clear. we oppose poto but that doesnaEUR(tm)t entitle anybody to cast a doubt on our patriotism or question our nationalism. it has been argued that poto is necessary to curb terror. how did the terror attack on parliament (december 13) happen, while poto was in existence? if poto had helped strengthen intelligence functioning, could the godhra carnage have happened? what then will poto be used for? the fear is, it will be used selectively against minorities. less than 48 hours after poto was passed in lok sabha, came reports that the ordinance has been selectively and widely used against muslims in gujarat, specifically those involved in the godhra incident. sixty people, all muslims, have been booked under poto. not one of the over 800 arrested for violence in ahmedabad and other areas of gujarat, have been booked under poto. it is obvious that for narendra modiaEUR(tm)s government, crimes by the minority community are considered more heinous than those committed by the majority and therefore more deserving of stringent punishment. for modi, the systematic targeting of families and putting entire neighbourhoods on fire is evidently not an act of terror. national security is of paramount importance. without protecting the security of a nation, individual rights cannot be protected. the worth of a nation is the worth of the individuals constituting it. aEUR~aEUR~the right to fair trial, the right of liberty and security of person, the right to freedom of expression, the right to redress and the right not to be tortured would all be at risk under poto,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) is a fear expressed by amnesty international. law minister arun jaitley said, poto will clearly lay out for the police, the framework in which they can operate, thus they will not be able to misuse it. i disagree. similar repressive laws in the past have been used by the police to circumvent their usual course of probe. how do we deal with terrorism then? the nhrc says, aEUR~aEUR~a proper strengthening of the crime investigation and prosecution machinery and criminal justice system is needed. if there are a large number of acquittals today, it is not for the lack of laws, but for the lack of proper utilisation of these laws, lack of proper investigation and prosecution, and lack of adequate number of courts to try the offences. unless this root problem is readdressed, adopting draconian laws will only lead to their grave misuse.

"This story is from March 23, 2002  gandhinagar: the bjp rulers of gujarat on friday adopted a belligerent mood, with two of its ministers resorting to unprecedented minority bashing in the wake of the second wave of communal violence that began in ahmedabad and other places of the state on march 15. senior cabinet minister fakirbhai vaghela, making an intervention in the state assembly, directly blamed the minorities for the recent disturbances in vatva, dani limda, kalupur, bapunagar, karanj, dariapur, shahpur, madhupura areas of ahmedabad. holding the portfolio of social justice and empowerment, vaghela said the minorities had attacked the dalits at all these places. he told the house to take a serious note of it. another minister, karsanbhai patel, in charge of the welfare of socially and educationally backward classes, keenly went deep into the reasons of the riots, saying their roots could be found in the ""anti-indian thinking"" of the muslims, despite the fact that ""nearly 95 per cent of them are converts from hinduism"". the sharply-worded remarks, curiously, stood in complete contrast to chief minister narendra modi''s appeal for restraint and tolerance on friday. appreciating the vishwa hindu parishad''s decision not to take out ''asthi yatra'' in the memory of the victims of godhra massacre, and that of tazia committees to avoid muharram procession, modi said in a statement here that these would go a long way in bringing about peace in the state. modi''s statement came soon after the congress spurned his proposal for a joint bjp-congress peace march to the income-tax circle in ahmedabad. instead, 40 congress mlas quietly walked out of the assembly in protest against the failure to handle the communal riots. soon after the walk-out at 8.45 am, following a short statement by congress deputy chief udesinh baria, the mlas sat on a dharna, singing ram dhun for three hours till 1 pm in front of the gandhi statue on the lawns of the assembly. patel said, ""mullahs, maulvis, congress and madrassas are responsible for anti-indian feelings among the muslims... who is responsible for their failure to be part of the national mainstream? i think, it is the congress'' sin of the last 50 years. it is not just the hindus'' misfortune but also that of the muslims of india."" approvingly referring to the march 17 bangalore rss resolution, he said, ""india''s muslims are not protected by police or military or political parties. they are protected by the inherent liberalism and non-communal nature of hindus."" patel added, ""the day the muslims lose the hindus'' goodwill, india''s police or military would not be able to save them. that is the reason why rss chief sudarshan said the muslims should try to obtain the goodwill of the hindus. to this, the congress reacted demanding ban on the rss. it is unfortunate that the muslims think that the bjp is its enemy. marxists, mullah-maulvis, those across the border, dawood ibrahim, bin laden, laskhar-e-toiba, jaish-i-mohammed are their enemies in the same way as the congress."" issues related with social justice to the minorities come directly under the departments headed by vaghela and patel. none of the two ministers, however, mentioned what had forced the muslims to leave their burnt houses and how the government proposes to solve their problems."	0	0	0	1	0

hyderabad: in an interesting assessment of the unfolding political situation, the cpm has decided to revive the third front as a contender for power and at the same time agreed to cooperate with the congress without having any alliance with it. the three-yearly party congress, which is in session here to formulate its policy direction for the future, has called for building the peopleaEUR(tm)s front as a aEUR~aEUR~secular, democratic alternative to the ruling nda at the centreaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). however, the party on thursday made it clear that despite the need for cooperation with the congress to meet the challenge of the aEUR~aEUR~communal agenda of the bjp and its allies in the sangh parivar, it would not favour an electoral alliance with the main opposition partyaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). briefing reporters on the deliberations, party politburo member sitaram yechury termed the congress as a aEUR~aEUR~pale saffron partyaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). asked to explain the aEUR~aEUR~dichotomyaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) of the new cpm stand on broad opposition unity, he claimed that in the assessment of his party, the congress shared some of the follies of the bjp. the party in a resolution said: aEUR~aEUR~the continuous fight against religious fundamentalism was stressed upon in the discussion; sharpening of these struggles will pave the way to build a combination of non-bjp, non-congress forces that alone can help to meet the present critical situation.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) yechury, however, said that in a situation where supporting the congress remained the only option for preventing the bjp from coming to power, his party would not hesitate to do that. he cited the instance of maharashtra where the left lent support to the congress-led coalition government. apart from defining its own role in national politics, the cpm session discussed at some length the threat of minority fundamentalism. the issue had triggered a massive controversy within the party after west bengal chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee recently expressed concern over such a menace. if the trend of deliberations was any indication, the party seemed to have veered round to the view that there was need to account for this danger. aEUR~aEUR~minority fundamentalism is not the correct response to majority fundamentalism,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) yechury said, hinting at the mood in the session. in another significant departure, the party openly attacked the bjp allies in the nda instead of persuading them to reconsider their position. aEUR~aEUR~the most opportunistic political elements are the nda allies,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) yechury said, pointing out that had they put real pressure on the vajpayee government for the army deployment on the first day of the gujarat riots, many lives would have been saved. the new party line seems to be an effort to put pressure on the nda partners to reconsider their future in the alliance and make the congress amenable to the left susceptibility to certain aspects of the economic reforms which it endorsed.

new delhi: senior congress leader ghulam nabi azad, who is the longest-serving member of the congress working committee (cwc), was summarily shifted to jammu and kashmir as the president of the pradesh congress committee (pcc) on wednesday. before being shifted, azad was aicc general secretary in-charge of up, kerala and tamil nadu. azadaEUR(tm)s abrupt removal, which sent alarm bells ringing in congress circles, is not likely to be an isolated case. this move is being seen as a precursor to a series of changes in the party organisation. the organisational revamp and key changes at the state-level have been in the offing for several months but were delayed because of congress president sonia gandhiaEUR(tm)s preoccupation first with the assembly polls and then the parliament session. key changes in the party are expected within the next few days. senior party leaders were at pains to explain that azad was not being sidelined and that he was being moved to j&k to strengthen the party in the state which is due to go to polls later this year. congress spokesperson s jaipal reddy was quick to state that aEUR~aEUR~azad is one of the most trusted and competent leadersaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm), adding that his shift to j&k was similar to pranab mukherjeeaEUR(tm)s move to west bengal on election-eve. however, others pointed out that azad has been one of the most high- profile congress leaders and has always been entrusted with important party positions at the centre, adding that this is the first time that he is being sent to a state. he replaces mohammed shafi qureshi who had earlier resigned as pcc chief. it is also no coincidence that azadaEUR(tm)s removal comes barely a month after the partyaEUR(tm)s dismal performance in the assembly elections in up where the aicc general secretary was in- charge. congress circles are rife with speculation over the organisational changes. former uppcc chief salman khurshid is being tipped to replace azad as party general secretary. khurshid, however, is also in the race for the uppcc presidentship once again as there is tremendous pressure for the removal of the present state party chief s p jaiswal following the partyaEUR(tm)s poor showing in the assembly poll. party insiders said aicc general secretaries mahavir prasad, mohsina kidwai and oscar fernandes are also likely to be entrusted with other responsibilities. prasad, it was stated, will be replaced by a dalit and among the names being mentioned are former governor mata prasad, pravin rashtrapal from gujarat, g venkatswamy from andhra pradesh and h hanumanthappa from karnataka.

"This story is from March 16, 2002  gandhinagar: in the absence of the opposition congress on friday, which walked out en bloc from the state assembly to protest against suspension of their leader naresh raval, dissident bjp mlas jay narayan vyas, mahendra trivedi, arvind patel and atmaram parmar chose to embarrass senior ministers asking sharp questions on the neglect of the powerloom sector and state of the medical education in gujarat. participating in a question-hour debate, vyas fired the salvo by asking industries minister suresh mehta on what was being done to protect the state''s powerloom sector, facing stiff competition from the bhiwandi powerloom sector. he wanted to know whether or not the state government would provide fresh subsidies to the sector, currently suffering because of high electricity charges. surat mla atmaram patel wished to know what had happened to the committee formed to look into the problem. an embarrassed mehta replied that while the electricity tariff issue was something that the state government had no jurisdiction and a verdict on it was expected from the gujarat electricity regulatory commission (gerc), the issue whether to provide subsidy or not was under consideration. indicating that the proposed committee has not yet been formed, he said, ""this is also under consideration"". mehta informed the bjp mlas that the state had spent rs 195 crore as subsidy provided to the powerloom sector from august 2001 to october 2001. ""we had filed an affidavit with the gerc to bring down the electricity charges to the powerloom sector by 30 per cent. however, the gerc had refused to consider it. its judgment is awaited,"" he added. arvind patel wanted to know from state health minister ashok bhatt why non-gujaratis were preferred in 155 walk-in interviews for the post of medical tutors by signing bonds of rs 75,000. vyas commented, only ""outsiders were being encouraged"", while the gujaratis were made to fail in the interviews even if they had good marks. bhatt had to make frantic efforts to clarify that this was not so the case as quality matters. on the issue of having a postgraduate course in bhavnagar medical college, mahendra trivedi criticised bhatt for not giving exact time when it would start. bhatt merely said, ""we have fulfilled all the medical council of india (mci) conditions. we have asked the mci to send its inspectors to bhavnagar. we hope the classes will start soon."""	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 30, 2002  hyderabad: telugu desam party president n chandrababu naidu called upon partymen to get into aggressive campaign mode and convince the people about the reasons for the recent harsh decisions like power hike. addressing members of the politburo, ministers, mps, mlas and party office bearers at ntr trust bhavan, he said people need to be explained in detail the reasons that compelled the government to marginally hike the power tariff. he said along with the reasons for the hike, emphasis also needs to be laid on the subsidies the government was bearing to see that the burden on the common man was a bare minimum. he said this was absolutely necessary to take the sting out of the combined aEURoefalse campaignaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) of the congress and the left parties, he said. he said while the congress was indulging in mud-slinging for narrow political gains, the tdp had taken steps to put the state economy back on the rails and bring in overall improvement in the state. aEURoedo not think about what would happen in the hustings. i am confident that people will support us as long as we deliver the goods and live up to their expectations. congress does not have the capacity to match us in terms of discipline or vision. they only know how to throw mud on others, create obstacles in development and try to get political advantage. it is this which needs to be fought,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he added. the party had proved its secular credentials and had been cautioning the centre whenever it appeared to be wavering on issues like ayodhya and the recent violence in gujarat. tdp had categorically stated that all parties should abide by the verdict of supreme court. all other parties have followed us, he said.	0	0	0	0	0
new delhi: as expected, the governmentaEUR(tm)s move to enact a new stringent anti-terrorism legislation was defeated on thursday night when the rajya sabha rejected the prevention of terrorism ordinance bill by 113-98 vote, with 30 members absent from the 245-member house. the effective strength of the house at present is 241 with four seats vacant. the voting was on the same lines as in the lok sabha with the congress and left parties leading the fight against enactment of the bill and the ruling national democratic alliance staying firm. the nationalist congress party voted with the nda and the bahujan samaj party stayed away. after an evenly-matched decibel contest when the issue was put to voice vote after a marathon seven-hour debate, chairman krishan kant called for a poll division. first, the counter-resolution of the opposition, moved by kapil sibal of the congress, rejecting the governmentaEUR(tm)s move, was put to vote. it was passed by 113-98 votes. following this, the official resolution, for passage of the bill, moved by home minister advani, was voted on. it was rejected by same margin of 113-98 votes. the government now plans to convene a joint session of both houses of parliament early next week. this would be only the third such occasion in independent india. the earlier joint sessions were in 1961, on an anti-dowry law, and in 1978, on a banking recruitment law. the government has a small majority in the total strength of both houses. replying to the debate, advani said critics who said poto would neither solve nor prevent terrorism were missing the point. aEUR~aEUR~the prevention of corruption act doesnaEUR(tm)t mean corruption will end; the anti-murder laws donaEUR(tm)t stop murders. but you do need a weapon for the law-enforcing agencies to catch and convict terrorists and thus also put some apprehension in the lattersaEUR(tm) mind on the likelihood of getting caught....poto can only be a small part of the overall fight to tackle this huge menace...much more needs changing in society.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) his opponents said all this ignored indian reality. in a country, where the police routinely torture people in custody to extract confessions, making such confessions legally usable as evidence was idiotic. and in a country, where the police and state administration can connive in pogroms, as in gujarat, a draconian law in their hands is a potentially fatal attack on the democratic foundation. aEUR~aEUR~you already have a preventive detention law in the national security act. the nhrc, a statutory body chaired by a former chief justice, has firmly said existing laws are enough to tackle terrorism and the bill cannot be supported under any circumstances. why then are you pushing it, when there is such widespread opposition?aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) pleaded jurist fali nariman.

This story is from March 25, 2002  mumbai: with the holiday season fast approaching, more and more tourists are planning to spend their vacation in europe and the far east than in the us.  and it is not hard to guess why many of them are now thinking twice before booking a ticket to the us.  ``the memory of the terrorist strikes in the us on september 11 is still fresh in their minds and they do not want to take the risk of visiting the u.s. this summer,'''' a travel agent explained.  an official of sotc, a mumbai-based travel agency, has estimated that travel to the u.s. could be down by 20 per cent this year because of the events on september 11. however, he was hopeful that the demand will pick up soon.  a spokesperson of the american consulate told tnn that in march 2001, 11,903 non-immigrant visas were issued. in february 2002 the figure was a mere 6,917. the figures for march 2002 are not available, but indications are that there can be a marginal increase.  traditionally, mumbaikars preferred the u.s. to other destinations because of its vast array of tourist attractions. but, the developments of september have diverted the summer holiday rush to places in europe and the far east.  an official of cox and kings, a well known travel firm, said, ``the demand has swung heavily this year for places in europe and the far east. hence we are offering a seven-day package tour to the far east for rs 32,500 with no hidden costs. the places covered include bangkok, pattaya beach and singapore. the cost includes air fare, sightseeing and hotel charges.''''  alternatively, by paying rs 99,000 a person can opt for a 15-day tour of europe and visit france, italy, switzerland, belgium, netherlands and the uk. as in the case of the far east, the amount includes cost of air fare, sightseeing charges and accommodation. ``many people have chosen the europe tour because it offers a lot of history,'''' he said.  spokesperson of travel corporation of india (tci) meher bhandara said the focus has shifted from the u.s. to south east asia this year.``at the moment there is not a big demand for the u.s. as it was the case earlier,'''' she stated.  for just $299 tci is offering a four-day tour of singapore or malaysia or thailand. ``we have even joined hands with malaysian tourism to promote that country which has a lot to offer. we are being flooded with inquiries about malaysia,'''' she stated. tci was also offering special packages to sri lanka.  ``the demand for going on a holiday to australia, new zealand and the far east is more this year than it was in 2001,'''' a spokesperson for thomas cook stated. she said taking advantage of the popularity of these places her organisation has reached an understanding with hotels and airlines in australia to offer discounts. ``the discounts and the rates for the package tours are cheaper than last year,'''' she added.  according to her, the terrorist strikes in the us in september along with the economic recession has forced many people to cancel their holiday plans in december. ``now the situation has improved and the demand for holiday packages is rising,'''' she said.  with most of the city schools closing for the summer recess on april 18 there was is ``good response'''' for holiday packages offered by thomas cook.  the sotc official said the demand for travel to europe was 30 per cent more this year than in 2000. he said last year because of the quake in gujarat there was a sharp fall in the number of visitors going on a holiday abroad. this was because gujaratis constitute a sizeable chunk of holiday makers.  the package offered by sotc allows a couple to take a tour of europe by paying the cost for one person. in addition, there will be no charge for children below 12 years. for example, the earlier cost an individual had to bear for a 14-day european tour was 1,149 dollars. now, under the special incentive scheme two adults pay 1,699 dollars for the same tour. ``the demand for these packages is very good,'''' he added.	0	0	0	0	0
new delhi: during the recent hearing on the issue of bhoomi puja, the supreme court had the occasion to learn from vhp counsel that aEUR~aEUR~there is no enmity between hindu and muslims. in fact, the electronic media and print media is responsible for creating oneaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). counselaEUR(tm)s last ditch effort to persuade the court to allow the puja in the acquired land however failed. but, his submission must be welcomed to the extent that there is no enmity between the two communities. whether the latter part of the contention was a fair allegation against the media could be judged from the ground realities. that the court would have dismissed the counselaEUR(tm)s plea was obvious. the court had insisted on upholding the 1994 judgment, which categorically said the acquired land would be kept in the custody of the central government and not be used for any religious activity, temporary or permanent, by anyone. it maintained that a secular state cannot have any religion of its own. it cannot promote one religion at the cost of other. secularism being a basic feature of the constitution, the state or its instruments or officers are not expected to act in a manner which might leave an impression that the state is in favour of one community or religion. on this count, the acceptance of a aEUR~aEUR~shilaaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) by shatrughan singh, in- charge of the ayodhya cell in the pmo, has reopened a debate on whether religion should be mixed with politics. the supreme court has time and again cautioned the political leadership against using derogatory expressions, including setting examples that may be construed as intemperate. aEUR~aEUR~lack of restraint in the language used and the derogatory terms made to refer to a group of people... indeed must be condemned... the likely impact of the language by a political leader is greater. it is, therefore, a greater need for the leaders to be more circumspect and careful in the language they use... this is essential not only for maintaining decency and propriety but also for the preservation of time-honoured values forming part of our cultural heritage,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) a bench comprising justices j s verma, n p singh and k venkataswamy had said in a judgment.

This story is from March 22, 2002  hyderabad: scoffing at the speculation over a possible change in leadership of the party in the ongoing 17th national congress, the cpm has asserted that there was no such proposal and harkishan singh surjeet continued to be the general secretary of the party. aEURoethere is no proposal for a change of leadership. we will not have candidates for the posts and we believe in collective leadership in the party represented by the politburo, central committee and general secretary. harkishan singh surjeet continues to be the party general secretary,aEUR cpm politburo prakash karat said. participating in a meet-the-press programme organised by the andhra pradesh union of working journalists on thursday, karat said that he was puzzled as to why the issue of leadership has become a matter of speculation in the media. karataEUR(tm)s statement assumes significance in the light of media speculation that the cpm was gearing up for a leadership change to infuse young blood into the party. reports in a section of media went to the extent of claiming that prakash karat had been selected as a successor to surjeet. aEURoethe issue of change in leadership will not come up in the ongoing congress,aEUR he categorically said. the senior cpm leader also rejected speculation that the party has decided to replace surjeet by him reiterating that surjeet continues to be the general secretary. taking exception to queries by reporters that the party was in the hands of gerontocrats, karat said that the party had a good combination of old and youth and over 60 per cent of its 8.4 lakh members across the country were below 40 years. strongly criticising the bjp-led central government for its attempts to enact the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), he said that the entire opposition was united in the issue and would not allow the passage of the bill which was put in the rajya sabha on thursday. the cpm leader alleged that the draconian provisions of poto were openly biased against the minority sections which was clearly reflected by its selective use by narendra modi government in gujarat. aEURoethe gujarat government has used the provisions of the ordinance to target minorities and registered cases against 65 muslims for indulging in the godhra incident. however, not a single activist of the vishwa hindu parishad or bajrang dal which indulged in large-scale violence resulting in the killing of over 750 people in gujarat have been arrested so far,aEUR karat said. karat pointed out that the provisions incorporated in poto were more dangerous than tada and any organisation could be declared terrorist under it without qualification of the charges. aEURoethe members of such organisations including those who provide financial support to it at any point of time can be arrested under the clauses of preventive detention without a bail,aEUR he said. karat appealed to the state governments of all non-bjp parties not to implement the act in their respective states even if the bill was passed by convening a joint session of parliament. aEURoeall the state governments should take a united stand on the issue. the west bengal and kerala governments have already clarified that they would not implement poto in their states,aEUR he said adding this was one way to isolate the bjp.	0	0	1	1	0

"This story is from March 17, 2002  ahmedabad: the d-day called march 15 has gone by and tension has ebbed in ayodhya. even ahmedabad remained largely calm on saturday. what, however, refused to decline was the flow of riot-victims seeking shelter at relief camps across the city. when amdavadis preferred to remain off roads in the walled city areas, riot victims continued to throng relief camps across in large numbers. people, who were stuck in different areas of the city waiting for the violence to die down, have begun re-emerging from their hideouts, making a beeline for the numerous relief camps dotting the city. with gory tales of mass murders on their lips and recounting days spent closetted inside dark dingy godowns, the riot victims continue to swell at camps like those at dariyakhan ghummat in sahibaug, aman chowk in bapunagar and shah-e-alam roza in shah alam area. the chairman of ahmedabad municipal corporation''s standing committee badruddin sheikh told tnn: ""the number of riot victims who have taken shelter in 24 camps across the city has now grown to 40,000. insecurity and fear of falling prey to stray incidents of violence coupled with partial ebb in the mayhem has driven many away from homes to safe havens like these relief camps."" the camp at sahibaug which is housed inside a modest campus of a municipal school near the dariyakhan ghummat saw an increase of 1,500 victims during the past 24 hours. afraid of a fresh outbreak of violence in riot-torn areas like dudheshwar, these people, most of whom are now homeless, have boosted the total number of riot-refugees at sahibaug to 6,000. ""the sahibaug area is in a curfew-like state on saturday. but even the fear and deserted roads could not keep these riot-affected away,"" said inamul iraki, a co-ordinator of the camp. ""friday''s violence and disturbance at the mahakali mandir area in dudheshwar has further scared the local residents who are heading for the camps to be in a relatively safer place. though we have enough food grains now, accommodating everybody could become a problem if this trend continues,"" he added. when it comes to housing the largest number of riot victims, the relief camp at shah alam area tops the list. here the figure has touched 9,000 as victims from fringe areas like dholka, sanand, devgam, vatwa and naroda-patia came in large numbers. imtiaz sheikh, a voluntary worker at the camp, told tnn: ""as peace is gradually returning to the state the victims are heading for this camp at shah-e-alam roza. some do not have a place to go to. others have lost all means of livelihood. some pilgrims, hailing from maharashtra, heading towards ajmer too have taken shelter here."" gaffar shah from dhulia of maharashtra lamented: ""i belong to a team of 12 children and five adults going towards ajmer. midway, some way off vadodara, the bus carrying us stopped and dumped us. while the vehicle sped away with our belongings, a mob attacked and injured many of our team. leave along proceeding towards ajmer, i don''t know when i will get back home."" aman chowk, the traditional camping area for members of minority community after every riot, now has the biggest-ever conglomeration. aman chowk is packed to capacity with 8,500 hapless victims.

This story is from March 28, 2002  mumbai: the congress party caught the wrong end of the stick on wednesday when speaker after speaker at a youth congress-organised symposium on `politics of religion'' lambasted the party for exploiting religion for narrow political ends while professing to be secular.  to add to the organisers'' embarrassment, yc activists applauded the speakers'' critical remarks.  the bjp, by comparison, found little mention from the invitees, who included advocate yusuf muchhala of the all-india muslim personal law board, script writer javed akhtar, co-editor of communalism combat teesta setalvad, former chief secretary of maharashtra j.b. d''souza and ramji tewari, former head of the mumbai university''s hindi department. some of the speakers rubbed it in by saying that the topic ought to have been `religion of politics''.  ms setalvad set the tone by accusing the congress of being afraid to speak out against the narendra modi government for fear of losing the hindu vote.  reminding the audience that the congress was in power at the centre during the anti-sikh riots of 1984 and in maharashtra during the 1992-''93 riots in mumbai, muchhala said that he was struck by the similarity between those riots and the recent violence in gujarat. ``the partisanship of the police, the lack of political will, the explanation given by the ruling party are all too familiar,'''' he said.  akhtar blamed the congress for propping up fundamentalist muslim leaders while neglecting the moderates and said that the trend started right after independence.  ms setalvad, who has returned from a fact-finding trip to gujarat, said one of the leaders of the mob that attacked former congress mp ehsaan jaffrey''s house was a former congress corporator who had been denied a ticket by jaffrey.  she said the 65,000 people in the relief camps at ahmedabad were virtually starving and demanded to know what the congress was doing to organise aid for them. speakers also noted that no big business house had come forward to donate money towards relief work in gujarat.  muchhala lamented that democracy had come to be associated only with polls and the spirit of accommodation associated with it was missing. ``the congress could have utilised its organisational network in gujarat for relief work but it hasn''t,'''' he noted.  ms setalvad said the congress ought to teach its cadres the true meaning of secularism if it wanted to remain a party of consequence.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 23, 2002  deshermohan (asansol): this nondescript village in jamuria, about 30 kilometres from asansol, can easily be promoted as a model village of communal harmony. for the last 100 years in this muslim-dominated village, the artists of the minority community have been cutting rocks and making blocks which have been used in building temples. not only temples, the artists turn these rocks into beautiful pancha pradips, pradips, dhupdaani, chandankath ghosa etc all used for worshipping hindu gods and goddesses. whatever may happen in godhra and ayodhya, the population of 500 here are pretty safe. one influence might have come from the rebel poet nazrul islam, who has spent many days of his childhood here. seikh mukhtar (49) says that they work for four hours a day and earn about rs 60. some of the products are also sold in the nazrul mela in churulia and joydeb mela in kenduli. the area is very rich in natural wealth and the villagers are making the best use of it. the first layer of the ground is hard rock followed by coal. they take the rocks absolutely free of cost and cut them and make different items and then sell them. aEURoeit requires a lot of hard work and the profession is not rewarding,aEUR says afjal seikh (22). the retirement age is about 50 years. and already great artists like md. ali jaan and seikh sattar have retired. the older people have been suffering from tuberculosis and silicosis. seikh islam, a member of the churulia gram panchayat, said that the artists, despite several requests to the state government, failed to get the cottage industry status. naturally, it has been the greatest obstacle for the budding artists of deshermohan. aEURoethe young generation is not coming to this profession instead they choose the more lucrative profession of illegal coal mining,aEUR says biswanath nandy, a teacher of deshermohan primary school. for the majority of the people living in the 115 houses this has been a cause of worry.	0	0	0	0	0

"new delhi: the vajpayee government is finding it increasingly difficult to live down its sangh parivar ties. after ayodhya, nda allies are now talking tough on the orissa assembly attack, lending voice to an old opposition demand: ban the vhp, bajrang dal. the samata party, janata dal (united) and the trinamul congress aEUR"" which along with crucial partner telugu desam party spent a better part of last week upset with the government on the ayodhya developments aEUR"" on monday demanded in the lok sabha that the vishwa hindu parishad and bajrang dal be banned for their reported role in the attack on the orissa assembly on saturday. the tdp has stopped short of demanding a ban, but expects ""strict action against those responsible"". tdp leader yerran naidu told times news network: ""we have to condemn such a barbaric act. the government must control these organisations"". in the lok sabha, an impromptu debate on the issue took up all of zero hour and more with jd(u) member devendra prasad yadav saying ""fundamentalism in any form should not be allowed in the country and organisations like vhp and bajrang dal should be banned."" prabhunath singh of samata party and nitish sengupta of the trinamul joined him in demanding action against the sangh organisations. terming the incident as condemnable, sengupta demanded that the government take exemplary action against the vhp and bajrang dal, of the kind it had not done before. singh pointed out that if ""carrying firearms is illegal so is carrying trishuls"". he suggested that those guilty be booked under the prevention of terrorism ordinance. but the bjp, while condemning the incident, disagreed with its allies. party spokesman v.k. malhotra said the allies'' demand for a ban was ""their own opinion"". he pointed out that the vhp had denied that any of its members was involved. malhotra also felt that the incident did not merit singh''s suggestion of invoking poto. opposition parties like the congress and the left, which have long been demanding a ban on the two sangh outfits, sense a rift. happy to see fissures in the nda coalition, the parties are now ""appealing"" to the ""secular identities"" of the allies. congress spokesman jaipal reddy said: ""the nda partners, strange bedfellows as they are, need to think."" asked if there was a message for the allies in this, reddy, however, said: ""we don''t expect anything from nda allies. we are just reminding them of their own agenda. condemning the attack on the orissa assembly, the senior congress leader ""appealed to all thinking people that this is a symptom of the disease, not the disease itself. the disease is the fundamentalist philosophy harboured by the rss"". the party has also lashed out at the rss for its resolution passed on sunday. the orissa incident was the focus of both houses of parliament, with opposition members using strong words to condemn the ""attack on parliamentary democracy"". in the rajya sabha, opposition members suggested that the leader of the house move a resolution condemning the attack to be adopted unanimously. external affairs minister jaswant singh did so and the upper house adopted the resolution recording ""deep concern and anguish"" and recommending ""stern and deterrent action against the guilty persons."" the government too strongly condemned the attack, with prime minister atal bihari vajpayee ""unequivocally"" condemning the attack in the rajya sabha. the attack, he said, was a ""blot"" on democracy and voiced concern at reports that the mob had raised slogans in his name. in the lok sabha, advani said the culprits should be punished, but did not touch upon the demand to ban the two sangh outfits. with the hindutva agenda at odds with the secular credentials that the allied parties bank on, the government is being pushed in a corner. the allies have said they would not like to rock the boat, but have also made it clear that they will put pressure where it is required. ruling out withdrawal of support, naidu said: ""support is a different matter. but we will continue to take up issues."" commenting on the ayodhya events passing off peacefully last week, an nda ally leader said: ""our pressure worked. we have our own constituencies to think off. we cannot allow the prime minister to yield to pressure from the bjp, vhp or rss.""

"This story is from March 22, 2002  ahmedabad: violence showed no signs of abating in gujarat three weeks after the communal riots broke out. while two persons were killed in police firing in ahmedabad''s vatva area on wednesday, another victim of police firing in modasa succumbed to injuries at vs hospital here. tension gripped modasa, under indefinite curfew since tuesday, as the body of the police fire victim was handed over to his family. curfew was clamped on himmatnagar in sabarkantha after the recovery of the body of a boy, who was missing since tuesday, sparked arson and rioting. hsc (class xii) board exams were also cancelled. ahmedabad continued to seethe with two persons, including a woman, being killed in police firing after mobs went on the rampage in vatva, torching hutments and cabins with petrol bombs before the police moved in and restored order. the mob set ablaze a godown and hutments in the nava chunaravaas area around 5 pm. sources told tnn, ""when the police tried to restrain them, they pelted stones and threw petrol bombs."" tear-gas shells were lobbed after which the police opened fire. five people, including two women, were injured and hospitalised. official sources in himmatnagar said tension built up in the city after the body of the missing boy was found. he had come to the city for shopping from vadali on tuesday when he went missing. though his motorbike was found parked near a store, there was no trace of him and an offence was lodged. but a mob surrounded the police station and set ablaze some seven huts in the chhaparia to vent their anger. tear-gas shells were lobbed to disperse the crowd. sabarkantha district collector mukesh puri said the situation was under control since 4 pm when curfew was imposed.

""the local vhp and bjp members are blaming the minority community. they had given a deadline of 2 pm to the police to fetch the boy. his motorcycle was found but the boy must have gone missing in the confusion after the stone-pelting on tuesday,"" said a resident. education minister anandiben patel, however, said the rioting in himmatnagar seemed to be ""a strategy to get the examinations postponed"". she said she had reasons to believe that the violence in bharuch and modasa on tuesday was also engineered to get the exams postponed. the exams have already been postponed in ahmedabad, vadodara, bharuch and modasa following violence. eyewitnesses said a group of more than 1,500 people had surrounded the police station demanding the recovery of the boy since morning. later, the tension manifested itself in arson and violence following which the exams had to be cancelled. the ssc (class 10) exams were not affected."	1	0	1	0	1

hyderabad: lending a new element to the current political turmoil, the cpm has called some of the nda constituents to leave the ruling coalition and hinted at the possibility of accommodating them in the people's front. as part of its effort to build the third alternative, the ongoing party session here has assessed that the ''transgression'' of the nda agenda by the vajpayee government on the ayodhya issue had provided the partners with the cause for reviewing their continuation in the coalition. this, in fact, was the most significant outcome of the marathon debate at the party congress on the draft political resolution. during the two-day discussion, there were awkward moments for the top leadership when some of the state units questioned its growing proximity to the congress in national politics. the kerala unit, in particular, lost no opportunity in pointing out that the party's confrontation with the congress had left a bitter and bloody trail. in tripura, one participant recalled, the congress had been accused of seeking support from insurgent elements to defeat the cpm. scurrying under attack from the state units, the leadership hurriedly announced projecting the third alternative leaving the congress out of its ambit. in an effort to invest the third front idea with a greater sense of urgency, the party on friday said that adjusting some of the nda constituents into the new grouping was a distinct possibility. ''the partners should rethink their position in the coalition in view of the violation of the nda agenda by the government with its connivance with the vhp on the ayodhya issue,'' cpm politburo member prakash karat told reporters. replying to a question, karat agreed that if some of the bjp allies decided to leave the nda, their admission into the people's front could be considered. ''how can we say no if they leave the bjp?'' he remarked. he claimed that the centre's conduct during the recent ayodhya episode was enough reason for the nda partners to come out of the alliance. ''the attorney-general's unprecedented argument in court to allow puja on the disputed land, the dispatch of a pmo official to receive the shila from the sadhus -- all this was clear evidence of the bjp-led government patronising the vhp movement,'' he said. significantly, west bengal chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee is slated to meet his andhra pradesh counterpart chandrababu naidu on saturday. observers see the meeting as the beginning of the left's renewed effort to wean away the ''secular'' parties from the bjp.

"This story is from March 23, 2002  ahmedabad: with the gujarat university (gu) unlikely to change its schedule for the upcoming final exams, many are afraid it may clash with the school board exams in ahmedabad. both the exams are nearly a month away but if rumours keep flying and the situation remains tense, the two exams could vie with each other for additional police personnel especially in the sensitive areas of the city. although the state government has not announced the dates for the standard x and xii exams for ahmedabad yet, sources say they could be held in the middle of april. the gujarat university on the other hand will hold the final exams from april 18 according to the present schedule, effectively ensuring that the two crucial exams come up at the same time. ""we have only delayed a couple of the medical exams,"" said vice-chancellor naresh ved. ""for the time being we have no intention of delaying any of the other exams."" the university has postponed its bachelors and masters dental surgery exams from march 20 to april 4. it has also postponed the physiotherapy exams scheduling them along with the dental exams. traditionally, the university and board exams are not held at the same time to avoid logistical problems like providing security to the exam centres and ensuring that there is no traffic jam around the centres. this time there are two groups in the university; one that believes exams should be held as scheduled, while the other says it is best to postpone in view of the delayed board exams. l d arts college principal and secretary of the gujarat university affiliated principals'' association a u patel believes it is best to stick to the schedule. ""any further delay will create many problems for third-year students looking at higher studies outside the state,"" he said. ""besides this, april 18 is a long time away. things should calm down by then."" those who do not want to hold exams on april 18 are worried about exam centres being situated in communally sensitive areas. also, to avoid delays, many of the exams will have to be held together ensuring that a large number of students will be packed into the centres. as many as 60,000 university students are expected to take the exam on april 18 with about 40,000 appearing in ahmedabad city alone. sources in the university say they will have to turn almost all the colleges in the city into exam centres to accommodate such a large number of students. this includes colleges in sensitive areas like bhavan''s college at khanpur, s v arts college on relief road, and n c bodiwala and professor m c desai commerce college at tankshal in kalupur. these are among the many colleges in sensitive areas which have traditionally been exam centres. the one reassuring voice, however, came from principal of f d arts & commerce college s k mansuri. despite his college being situated in jamalpur chakla area he said, ""holding the exams may help in reducing tension in the city. young minds get something important to do which helps in diverting them from violence."""	0	0	1	0	0

""the camps will continue to exist until the people residing there feel confident of coming out and going back to their homes,"" modi said. this was the first time since the godhra incidents in late february 2002 that modi was meeting the prime minister. the meeting happened at a time when modi was facing wide-spread criticism over his failure to prevent rioting in his state. his government has also been accused of being in complicity with the rioters. the riots and the opposition''s distrust in the modi government notwithstanding, the bjp-led government has little options to replace modi as he is currently the only bjp chief minister representing a major state. as if to prove modi''s detractors wrong, the police also, at last, seems to be taking some action to stop the rioters. one person was killed and six others injured in the eastern part of ahmedabad on tuesday night when the police fired to disperse mobs pelting stones. modi, who came to the capital on wednesday morning, was closeted in a meeting with the prime minister and home minister l k advani. minister of state in the prime minister''s office, vijay goel and senior government officials also participated in the meeting. the gujarat chief minister, it was learnt, made a detailed powerpoint presentation on how peace was spreading fast in gujarat. among the examples that modi had provided were: the muslim festival of muharram went off peacefully in the state, there has been no untoward incidents in the ongoing panchayati election campaigning in the state, the board exams have gone off well and the 3,500 hajis who had visited mecca from gujarat have all come back safely. modi, it was learnt, has also extended an invitation to the prime minister to visit the state and personally witness the peace process. reacting to media reports on the gujarat government shunting out a few ""honest"" police officers because they had dared to go against the ruling party diktat and arrested hoodlums with vhp links, modi said, ""much is being made out of these transfers. all of them are promotion postings"". he, however, declined to comment on the reports of the national human rights commission. all he said was that the state government was committed in sending its report to the nhrc by march 27 and the report would reach the commission by wednesday evening. related stories:A 1 killed in ahmedabad, police firing in vadodaraA fear still stalks gujaratA full coverage: gujarat violence    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	1	1	1	0	1
"ahmedabad: a public interest litigation was filed in the gujarat high court on wednesday challenging the jurisdiction of the national human rights commission (nhrc), under section 36 of the protection of human rights commission act, to intervene in violence-torn gujarat. a division bench comprising justice d s sinha, chief justice of high court, and justice b c patel issued notices in the petition filed by the city-based karuna public charitable trust, making them returnable on april 8 next. the notices have been issued to nhrc, its chairman justice j s verma, union of india and gujarat government. the pil sought direction that the nhrc or its chairman may not be allowed to investigate or intervene in the circumstances that led to widespread violence in gujarat specially as they were no more under nhrc''s jurisdiction after the appointment of the k g shah commission by the state government to probe godhra train carnage and the subsequent reprisal attacks under the commission of inquiry act. the petition also sought direction for deletion and removal from the nhrc''s records facts, statements, evidences, affidavits, depositions, photographs, documents and materials. s b vakil, counsel for the petitioner, submitted that the pil was filed for restraining the nhrc from making any report on the basis of reports of facts, statements and evidences in any manner collected under the provisions of the protection of human rights commission act, 1993 as the express provisions of section 36 (1) provides that the commission shall not inquire into any matter which was pending before a state commission or any other commission duly constituted under any law. the nhrc cannot take cognizance in the present case as the gujarat government has already appointed a one-man commission under retired high court judge justice k g shah under the provisions of commission of inquiry act, he added. vakil submitted that it was improper for justice verma to criticise state government even before taking up the matter. the nhrc chairman was well within his right to visit any place in gujarat and take whatever steps he deemed proper under the act in fulfilling his constitutional obligations, vakil said.

"new delhi: coming to the aid of a beleagured bjp, defence minister and nda convener george fernandes said the ruling coalition''s partners cannot dictate the bjp on its relationship with the sangh parivar. virtually endorsing the parivar''s stand on the ayodhya issue, the samata party leader has also favoured its solution through dialogue ""as courts cannot decide on questions left behind by history."" ""it is for that party (bjp) to decide on the nature of its relationship with the sangh parivar. as part of the nda, we have committed ourselves to a certain programme. our (allies'') concern should be to ensure that that programme is not diluted,"" fernandes said in an interview here. he was responding to a question on the apprehensions raised by some allies, including his own samata party leaders, on the close relationship between the bjp and the parivar. fernandes said there was nothing new in the bjp''s ties with the sangh parivar. in the wake of the gujarat violence and the vhp''s plans to take out ashes of godhra train attack victims across the country, the nda had met and agreed on saturday last not to deviate from the coalition''s agenda. fernandes, who had met the rss top brass and the kanchi shankaracharya as part of efforts to resolve the ayodhya tangle earlier this month, said the issue should be ideally resolved through a dialogue between the concerned parties.

This story is from March 19, 2002  lucknow: the shilas donated by the ram janambhoomi nyas on friday to the officer in charge of the ayodhya cell in the pmo shatrughan singh lawfully belonged to the centre, a spokesman of the state home department said on monday. in fact, state officials were awaiting directives from the centre for keeping the two shilas, at present placed at the dashrath mahal, a part of the bara sthan, in ayodhya, said the official adding that the state administration was in touch with the centre for keeping the two carved stones received during the shila daan. the district administration was responsible for the security of the carved stones, while it continued to be the property of the centre, said the official. since the owner of the dasrath mahal was not keen on keeping the shilas at his premises, these needed to be kept elsewhere, said the official. the official said that steps would be taken to restore normal public movement. but the restrictions on the movement of rambhakts would continue till there remained apprehensions about breach of peace, said the official. about reduction in the number of armed forces, the official said that they would be redeployed soon.  	0	0	1	0	0
This story is from March 22, 2002  hyderabad: in an interesting assessment of the unfolding political situation, the cpm has decided to revive the third front as a contender for power and at the same time agreed to cooperate with the congress without having any alliance with it. the three-yearly party congress, which is in session here to formulate its policy direction for the future, has called for building the peoples front as a aEURoesecular, democratic alternative to the ruling nda at the centre. however, the party on thursday made it clear that despite the need for cooperation with the congress to meet the challenge of the aEURoecommunal agenda of the bharatiya janata party and its allies in the sangh parivar, it would not favour an electoral alliance with the main opposition partyaEUR. briefing reporters on the deliberations, party politburo member sitaram yechuri termed the congress as a aEURoepale saffron party. asked to explain the aEURoedichotomy of the new cpm stand on a broad opposition unity, he claimed that in the assessment of his party the congress shared some of the follies of the bjp. the party in a resolution said, aEURoethe continuous fight against religious fundamentalism are stressed upon in the discussion; sharpening of these struggles will pave the way to build a combination of non-bjp, non-congress forces that alone can help to meet the present critical situation.aEUR yechuri, however, said that in a situation where supporting the congress remained the only option for preventing the bjp, his party would not hesitate to do that. he cited the instance of maharashtra where the left lent support to the congress-led coalition government. apart from defining its own role in national politics, the cpm session discussed at some length the threat of minority fundamentalism. the issue had triggered a massive controversy within the party after west bengal chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee recently expressed concern over such a menace. if the trend of deliberations was any indication the party seemed to have veered round to the view that there was a need to account for this danger. aEURoeminority fundamentalism is not the correct response to majority fundamentalism, yechuri said hinting at the mood in the session. in another significant departure, the party openly attacked the bjp allies in the nda instead of persuading them to reconsider their position. aEURoethe most opportunistic political elements are the nda allies, yechuri said pointing out that had they put real pressure on the vajpayee government for army deployment on the first day of the gujarat riots, many lives would have been saved. the new party line seems to be an effort to pressurise the nda partners to reconsider their future in the alliance and make the congress amenable to the left susceptibility to certain aspects of the economic reforms which it endorsed.	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 16, 2002  patna: even as no incident was reported in phulwarisharif and patna city on saturday, the police suspect that two persons were feared killed and three others injured in bomb explosions in patna city sub-division on friday. as a preventive measure the district administration, however, has intensified patrolling at these two places to avert any communal clash. in order to trigger communal clash in phulwarisharif on friday some miscreants had littered the pethia bazar locality, resided by people belonging to majority community, with bones of cows. before the situation could take an ugly turn some saner elements informed the district administration which immediately rushed police force and rapid action force (raf) who took command of the area. the miscreants had chosen the timing of throwing cow bones to spark clashes between the people of the two communities when the entire country was surcharged with tension over the aEURoeshila daanaEUR ceremony at ayodhya. though no incident was reported in phulwarisharif, police patrolling has been intensified. aEURoethe situation is well under control,aEUR said a senior police official on saturday. on the other hand the police claimed that two persons were feared killed in sultanganj bomb explosion. however, the police said that the bodies of the victims could not be traced even after 36 hours of the incident. incidents of bomb explosion were reported in sultanganj and khajekalan localities when miscreants, including the victims, were making bomb in their houses. according to the police, the bomb went off when it was being made at the resident of sukhari mian in ghagha ghat under the sultanganj police station on friday morning. police suspect that two persons, including sukhariaEUR(tm)s son shakeel, were dead in the explosion. an amputed limb of the victim was seized from the place. the identity of the other victim was not known. in yet another incident, one mohd faiz suffered serious burn injuries when he was making a bomb at his house at sadar gali under the khajekalan police station. the police said that the bombs were made to fan communal trouble in the locality. when the local police raided the residence of sukhari and mohd faiz they found the house empty.	0	0	1	0	0
This story is from March 30, 2002  bangalore: the political scene in karnataka resembles a cyclone-ravaged township, after the elections to four rajya sabha seats. flamboyant liquor baron vijay mallya stormed the field like a tornado, shook the edifice of the ruling congress, wreaked havoc in the bjp camp, left the janata dal shell-shocked and then moved to parliament house in delhi. while the congress and bjp are now pondering over what went wrong, janata dal is wondering what went right. let us look into the arithmetic of mallya''s victory: aEURC/ mallya entered the fray as an independent. he had just 31 votes in his kitty __ janata dal parivar 23 (jd-u 19; jd-s 4), independents 6 and expelled bjp members 2. he needed 14 more. he had to fend for himself to get the extra votes. but he managed to get 15 more, that too first preference votes, upsetting all calculations. he secured 46. aEURC/ mallya''s rival, bjp''s taradevi, who was short of just five votes (her party''s strength is 40), bit the dust as she could secure only 34. six of her own party legislators did not vote for her. neither did she receive any second preference votes. did the six partymen vote for mallya? the party says yes, while the legislators say no. aEURC/ the congress, on advice from its high command, asked its 147 mlas, including four associate members, to cast second preference votes in mallya''s favour. it allocated 49 first preference votes each for its candidates janardhana poojary, prema cariappa and rajashekaran. the surplus four votes to each of them was allotted as a precaution. to the party''s surprise, poojary polled 50 votes (one more than the allotted quota), cariappa 45 (four less) and rajashekaran 44 (five less). how did the two candidates fail to get the full quota of votes? did the nine first preference votes go to mallya? it appears so. aEURC/ result: mallya did not have to wait for the second preference votes to be counted. he secured 46 first preference votes __ more than that polled by two congress candidates. the big question here is: did six from the bjp and nine from the congress cross-vote for mallya? partymen are looking at each other with suspicion in both the camps. the bjp is the worst hit. its morale is already low, what with the national unit under flak over the gujarat massacre and ayodhya imbroglio, and the humiliating defeat in the recently-held elections __ the latest being the delhi civic poll. to add insult to injury, the state bjp is plagued with infighting, dissidence, groupism and personal animosities. that a bjp candidate could not secure the votes of members of her own party, considered at one time to have the most disciplined cadres, speaks volumes of the mess. the bjp has expelled the six, who it suspects of having cross-voted for mallya. more are said to be in the line of fire. at this rate, it is certain to lose the status of principal opposition in the state assembly. instead of looking within, fixing fences and putting the house in order, the leadership is pointing an accusing finger at the congress. it is high time the national leadership intervenes and drives some sense into the heads of warring members. whatever happened to the party''s dream of forming a government in karnataka, its first in the south? going by the happenings in the party, it looks the dream will remain a dream, at least in the near future. the congress too has reasons to worry. one, two of its candidates received less than the quota of first preference votes allotted. two, the said votes appear to have gone to mallya. it means open defiance of the party whip. the party cannot ignore the development. yes, in the past too, members have voted for individuals against the party''s wishes. this time it was too blatant. had not the party allotted surplus votes to its three candidates, one or the other would have even suffered defeat, causing acute embarrassment. the congress may be relishing with glee the mess in bjp, but it cannot lose sight of the fact that the janata dal parivar is regrouping. it won the kanakapura byelection against all odds and sent former pm deve gowda to parliament. the victory applied the brakes on the congress juggernaut. now, on ramakrishna hegde''s advice, the dal lent support to mallya, who in turn sent a scare in the congress camp and unsettled the bjp. some senior congressmen wonder why the party didn''t ask the high-profile mallya to contest as its candidate, than allow the dal to bask in his glory. after all he is a well-known face, a close relative of chief minister krishna, and an established industrialist who has his heart in karnataka. be it the congress or bjp, introspection is the need of the hour. the bjp must put its house in order if it is keen to prove it is still a force to reckon with in the state. the congress leadership must take a serious view of the cross-voting by some of its mlas. if it prefers to turn a blind eye to that, dissidence is bound to raise its ugly head sooner or later. dissidence was the main cause of congress''s defeat in the 1994 assembly elections. hopefully congressmen remember that. in the janata dal camp, there is excitement. mallya''s victory has given the parivar another shot in the arm, the first one being from kanakapura. but both the gowda and hegde factions are bewildered how mallya made it to the post. balram.singh@timesgroup.com or balramhs@indiatimes.com.  	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 23, 2002  lucknow: with no respite coming from the centre, the faizabad district administration is caught between the devil and the deep sea as anti-vhp saints have given 24-hour ultimatum for removal of two shilas failing which, they have reiterated their threat to throw them into a gutter. about two-dozen anti-vhp saints on friday held a meeting at bara sthan in ayodhya, an important seat of vaishno sect. prominent among those who had attended the meeting included mahant satyendar kumar das, chief priest of the make-shift ram temple at the sanctum sanctorum, swami devendra prasadacharya of dasrath mahal, mahant vishwanath das shastri, former bjp mp from sultanpur, mahant janmejay sharan, mahant jugal kishore shashtri of ramalaya trust. two resolutions were passed during the meeting. first, a five-member delegation of saints would call on the district magistarte bp mishra on saturday to mount pressure for removing the shilas from there. secondly, a 24-hour ultimatum has been given to the district administration to remove the two shilas from dasrath mahal or face the consequences. aEURoelike thieves they entered our premises at 11:30 pm on march 15 and pressurised the priest and forcibly kept the two shilas there,aEUR alleged prasadacharya. the chief priest of dasrath mahal said that the final decision on the two shilas would be taken by them on saturday afternoon after meeting the district magistrate. aEURoewe will have only two options. first, to go on indefinite fast to mount pressure on the centre and the district administration and second to break open the lock and throw away the two shilas in the gutter,aEUR fumed the chief priest. aEURoesaints in ayodhya are becoming restless over the silence of the district administration. we will be compelled to take drastic steps if they were not removed by saturday. the onus of the consequences, which might follow due to our actions, will rest on the district administration,aEUR warned mahant jugal kishore shashtri of ramalaya trust. when contacted, the district magistrate refused to come on line while the commissioner dr ak gupta maintained that the district administration has yet to receive directions from the central government. the district administration had shot off a letter to the ayodhya cell head and osd at pmo, satrughan singh, a few days ago seeking his directions where to keep the two shilas. but since then, no repoly has come from him. the ram janambhoomi nyas chairman mahant paramhans ramchandra das has already withdrawn himself from the ongoing controversy by saying that nyas has nothoing to do with the two shilas now. aEURoewe have nothing to do with the shilas after the daan on march 15. but the same should be made available to us when we start construction of the ram temple,aEUR warned the mahant of digamabr akhara.  	0	0	0	0	0

"new delhi: congress president sonia gandhi on friday made a blistering attack on the government in the lok sabha on the ayodhya issue charging it with openly collaborating with vhp in the wake of threat of ""dire consequences"" from bjp mps. participating in the debate on the motion of thanks to the president's address, the leader of the opposition said while there was no substitute for firm and resolute action on the issue, the prime minister and his colleagues have ""neither the will nor the capacity to deal with the vhp blackmail"". alleging that the bjp-led coalition took a ""u turn"" in the matter, she said the explanation for such a somersault lay in the fact that several bjp mps in a letter to the prime minister on march 7 threatened his government with ""dire consequences"". she said the ""u turn"" was reflected in the government earlier asking state governments to prevent all volunteers from proceeding to ayodhya but later telling them to provide police protection to those going towards the pilgrim centre. gandhi said she has documents with her regarding the sudden shift in government policy including the letter of bjp mps. in her 30-minute speech, the congress president accused the bjp-led coalition of ""caving in"" to communal forces and giving in to factional pressures overlooking national interests. claiming that the letter from bjp mps led to change in the mind of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee, gandhi said this resulted in the attorney-general being asked to intervene in the matter in the supreme court. she said people of the country felt that the prime minister and his government were ""neutral"" to vhp's plan till the prime minister instructed his attorney-general to plead for this plan in court. gandhi said what happened in the apex court on march 13 shocked the nation about the ""duplicity of the government agenda"". ""central government's acts of omission and commission on ayodhya are shameful to say the least,"" she said. turning to gujarat, she blasted the narendra modi government over the handling of recent violence in the state saying the ""complicity"" of the government in the incidents stood thoroughly exposed. she hit out at union home minister l k advani for giving a ""clean chit"" to the state government and the chief minister. asserting that the continuance of ""irresponsible and callous"" government in gujarat was an affront to the country's secular polity, she demanded that the judicial probe into the violence be conducted by a sitting judge of the supreme court. on the issue of national security, gandhi said there was ""no no evidence"" of a clear-cut strategy on the part of the government on jammu and kashmir and that people in the state continued to suffer while security forces faced grave risk. she regretted that even after two years of its submission, the house had been kept in the dark on the report of the subrahmanyan committee on kargil conflict and its implementation. the congress leader wanted to know from the government the progress on the list of 20 terrorists and criminals wanted from pakistan, whether islamabad's approach to cross-border terrorism has changed and the response of the international community to the speech of president pervez musharraf on january 12. she lashed out at the prime minister for re-inducting george fernandes as defence minister when the venkataswami commission was continuing with its probe into the tehelka expose. ""the prime minister has given fernandes a clean chit but what message has gone to the judge (probing the expose),"" gandhi said, adding the central vigilance commission reports on corruption had been ""hushed up"" and journalists exposing corruption in high places being targeted. in an obvious reference to the import of coffins for armed forces martyrs, she charged a senior minister with criticising the comptroller and auditor general for pulling up the defence ministry and said he had defiled the authority of the public accounts committee. gandhi referred to the ""carnage"" in godhra and the subsequent ""genocide"" in several parts of gujarat. observing that the gujarat episode was the ""symptom of the deeper malaise afflicting the country-that of politics of hate"", she said there were some representing this in the treasury benches. ""some are charge-sheeted"". gandhi stressed that the guilty must not be spared and all must ensure that peace returns to gujarat. attacking the budget, the congress leader said it was a ""mockery of sentiments"" expressed in the president's speech and that economic policies would lead to slowdown of growth. the employment scenario has never been as grave, she said ridiculing government's plans to provide ten million jobs per year. ""the government's policies have struck fear in the hearts of the working class,"" she said terming as ""misplaced priority"" the moves to retrench people from state-owned companies. attacking the government for its privatisation policy, gandhi asked why profit-making public sector undertakings were being sold off. criticising the hike in prices of kerosene and cooking gas, she said farmers were now facing mounting debts thanks to the increase in prices of urea and other fertilisers. gandhi sought immediate convening of a meeting of the central advisory board before changes in textbooks were approved.

"new delhi: ""ramchandraji would never condone what the vishwa hindu parishad is doing in the name of his temple at ayodhya and elsewhere. neither them, nor the all india muslim personal law board are the true representatives of their (respective) communities,"" feels shahi imam of jama masjid syed ahmed bukhari. accusing the aimplb for precipitating the ayodhya crisis, imam observed that the dispute existed essentially between the vhp and the government, but the board made the muslims a party to it, thus increasing the communal wedge in the country. the imam said the muslims had softened their stand on the ayodhya issue since 1992, but vested interests--who do not want peace in the country--were working against it. speaking to times news network at jama masjid on friday afternoon, bukhari said it was necessary for the muslim community not to react to ""provocations"" from the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh and the vhp, or lend any credence to aimplb. he ruled out any room for mutual talks between the leaders of the two communities towards solving the dispute. ""no matter what the prime minister or the law board members say, i strongly feel it is only the supreme court which can be trusted and which can solve the issue."" in light of the recent turn of events, there is an urgent need to speed up the case proceedings, the imam said. ""a day-to-day hearing is required and a solution must be found at the earliest so that there is no further damage to peace,"" he added. when asked about friday's shila daan at ayodhya, bukhari said it did not matter as long as it was not done on the land banned under the court's order. ""if it happens elsewhere, it is essentially a question of how the state looks at it. the real question here is that if a government officer is accepting a shila, it amounts to a government establishment tacitly accepting the vhp position. that shila is ultimately meant to be used in the ram temple which they want to construct there and the map of the temple includes both the disputed and undisputed land,"" bukhari said. ""they (the vhp) should learn to obey the rule of law of the land as much as anybody else. we have seen that even a written undertaking by them to the court means nothing to them. hence, there is a need for the government to be stern with them.""

ayodhya: normalcy is returning fast to this temple town even as batches of ram sevaks continued to pour in for a darshan at the makeshift ram temple. the restrictions imposed in the temple town to avoid any untoward incident during vishwa hindu parishad''s (vhp) shila daan programme on march 15 last, have been eased. security forces, however, continue to be deployed at all entry points, but vehicles and people are not subjected to any checks, official sources said. tempos and rickshaws have started plying in faizabad, but not allowed to enter ayodhya where only those vehicles having entry passes are allowed. security restrictions would be lifted in phases after reviewing the situation, sources said. devotees and ram sevaks thronged the temples in hanumangarhi area and the banks of the saryu river, which once again wore a colourful look with devotees offering prayers after a taking a dip in the sacred river. shops selling religious articles have also opened and loudspeakers blaring religious songs and hymns could again be heard. small batches of ram sevaks continued to arrive in the temple town on foot as buses and other modes of transport were still banned from entering ayodhya. vhp sources said that the ram sevaks arriving in the town were those who had taken shelter in the nearby districts and could not enter the town owing to restrictions. the vhp workshop here wore a deserted look while the karsevakpuram, where the 100-day long purnahuti yajna was taking place, is still bustling with activity. the administration is also making arrangements for the ram sevaks to reach nearby districts for their return journey, sources said. about 700 ram sevaks from maharashtra were sent to the neighbouring district of sultanpur on their way home, they said. though security at other places had been scaled down, a large number of police and paramilitary personnel continued to be deployed in and around the acquired land. several security barriers on the road connecting the temple town with faizabad have been lifted and some trucks loaded with goods were also seen plying on the national highway passing by the town.

This story is from March 18, 2002  bangalore: the deep fissures between hindus and muslims can be bridged only by religious heads and not politicians, shankaracharya of kanchi kamakoti peetham jayendra saraswathi swamigal said on sunday. speaking to reporters after inaugurating the new building of sri shankara smartha samskruta paatashala at vidyaniketan public school here, kanchi acharya, as he is popularly known, said political interference in such sensitive matters would only aggravate the problem. ``it would be better if it is left to the religious heads as politicians are bothered only about votes,''''he added. asked about communal disharmony that threatens to loom large over society, jayendra saraswathi, who negotiated between the vhp and the government on the ayodhya issue, said it has been proved time and again that mixing religion and politics is dangerous. vote ki rajneethi ab aneethi hogayi hai. rajeneethi ke neta jaldhi dhoor hone se maamla hal hojayega'''' he added. (vote bank politics has become unethical and immoral politics. keeping away politicians from religious issues would solve most of the problems). expressing satisfaction over the way things are shaping out at ayodhya, he said: ``ayodhya is not an issue any more as negotiations are on and will continue well. my job is over now and that others have to carry it forward. my blessings are always with them.'''' he added.  	0	0	0	0	0

"This story is from March 19, 2002  ahmedabad: till the other day, it was believed that only a censor can filter information before it is published. but for the time being, jailers in gujarat have taken up the job and doing it magnificently. yes, for the past few weeks since the communal violence erupted, jailers in the state are sieving the information published in newspapers before it reaches jail inmates. considering the communally surcharged atmosphere outside the walls, the inspector general of police (jails) has sent a circular to 22 jails in the state including two central jails under his command to take appropriate measures to prevent anything ''communal'' in nature from taking place inside the four walls. one of the steps taken by jail authorities in this direction was to supply censored information to prisoners so as to prevent misuse of a particular piece of information by anyone to whip up communal passions. ""we are closely monitoring newspapers and striking out all communally sensitive news items that could vitiate an inmate''s mind,"" says l v kharadi, superintendent of sabarmati central jail, ahmedabad. ""thankfully, we don''t have any cable connection,"" adds khardi in a lighter vain when asked about the impact of news channels. jail authorities, who had also planned to segregate inmates on the basis of faith to eliminate chances of possible friction, dropped the plan later on for want of space. but detainees held under poto from godhra and palanpur have been provided separate accommodation to prevent them from mixing with regular inmates. jailers have also held special briefing sessions for inmates immediately after the riots broke out. jail authorities now heave a sigh of relief as no communal incident has been reported so far from any of the 22 jails in the state. ""gauging the disturbed situation outside and its likely effect on inmates belonging to different faiths, we have decided not to take any chance,"" h r ghelot, igp (jails) told tnn. without completely ruling out the possibility of skirmishes between inmates because of the situation outside, ghelot said jailers have been asked to be on guard till the situation outside becomes normal.

ahmedabad: even as communal clashes triggered by the godhra carnage continued on sunday, the prime accused in the massacre was arrested on saturday night. haji bilal ismail sujela, chairman of the godhra municipalityaEUR(tm)s planning committee, was arrested after a long-drawn manhunt. in a fresh outbreak of communal violence in baroda, two persons were stabbed to death and the police fired several rounds in the air to disperse rioters throwing stones. bilal was later remanded to police custody. he and the other accused in the godhra carnage have been booked under the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) and for murder. bilal carried an indian passport, which showed that he had visited pakistan twice officially. there are, however, allegations that he made frequent visits to karachi. preliminary investigations indicated that bilal was in touch with isiaEUR(tm)s yusuf kharadi alias yusuf godhrawala. at the behest of kharadi, he had escorted ahmedabad-based underworld don abdul latifaEUR(tm)s wife mehrunissa and his brother-in-law abdul raoof from delhi to pakistan, using a fake passport. police sources at godhra said bilal had been booked for 10 offences earlier. he had started as a pick-pocket, the records of which are still with the railway police. aEUR~aEUR~later, he got involved in gambling and was running a club in godhra along with husain dhantiya, another accused in this case,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) said a police officer. the club was the place from where the accused used to operate together. the gujarat government has suspended a senior clerk in the irrigation department, inayat abdul sattar, for his alleged involvement in the godhra massacre, the sources added. sattar, a senior clerk with the panam dam division, was taken into custody earlier along with 26 others. in all, 51 persons have been arrested so far in the case. earlier, the state police had sent teams to mumbai, madhya pradesh and chhota udepur to apprehend bilal, whose main offence in this case is of having stopped fire-fighters from reaching the scene of the crime which could have saved many lives. interestingly, the police have found the records of a similar attack on kar sevaks in bharuch district in 1992, when they were returning by the dehra dun express from ayodhya after the demolition of the babri masjid. they were attacked in a similar fashion at palej. but there were no casualties that time. sources said the case file of the attack on the train at palej in 1992 will be submitted to the state government for reference and analysis from the angle of security, intelligence and investigation.

This story is from March 23, 2002  there is no denying that india has been a victim of terrorism, including cross-border terror propagated by pakistan for more than a decade now. hence, terrorism needs to be rooted out. but i am convinced the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), a draconian law, is impinging on our civil liberties and secular polity. like its predecessor tada, it will be misused. the conviction rate of tada arrests is a shocking 1.8 per cent. out of the 77,571 people arrested under tada, over 2000 were let off without trial because no evidence was found against them. surely, our fears that poto will be similarly misused should be addressed. instead we have home minister l k advani saying, aEUR~aEUR~those who oppose poto favour terrorism.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) this shocking statement is like us president george bush announcing after september 11, in a cowboy style, aEUR~aEUR~either you are with us or with them (terrorists).aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) we are with neither. let this be clear. we oppose poto but that doesnaEUR(tm)t entitle anybody to cast a doubt on our patriotism or question our nationalism. it has been argued that poto is necessary to curb terror. how did the terror attack on parliament (december 13) happen, while poto was in existence? if poto had helped strengthen intelligence functioning, could the godhra carnage have happened? what then will poto be used for? the fear is, it will be used selectively against minorities. less than 48 hours after poto was passed in lok sabha, came reports that the ordinance has been selectively and widely used against muslims in gujarat, specifically those involved in the godhra incident. sixty people, all muslims, have been booked under poto. not one of the over 800 arrested for violence in ahmedabad and other areas of gujarat, have been booked under poto. it is obvious that for narendra modiaEUR(tm)s government, crimes by the minority community are considered more heinous than those committed by the majority and therefore more deserving of stringent punishment. for modi, the systematic targeting of families and putting entire neighbourhoods on fire is evidently not an act of terror. national security is of paramount importance. without protecting the security of a nation, individual rights cannot be protected. the worth of a nation is the worth of the individuals constituting it. aEUR~aEUR~the right to fair trial, the right of liberty and security of person, the right to freedom of expression, the right to redress and the right not to be tortured would all be at risk under poto,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) is a fear expressed by amnesty international. law minister arun jaitley said, poto will clearly lay out for the police, the framework in which they can operate, thus they will not be able to misuse it. i disagree. similar repressive laws in the past have been used by the police to circumvent their usual course of probe. how do we deal with terrorism then? the nhrc says, a proper strengthening of the crime investigation and prosecution machinery and criminal justice system is needed. if there are a large number of acquittals today, it is not for the lack of laws, but for the lack of proper utilisation of these laws, lack of proper investigation and prosecution, and lack of adequate number of courts to try the offences. unless this root problem is readdressed, adopting draconian laws will only lead to their grave misuse.	0	1	1	0	0
This story is from March 21, 2002  lucknow: bjp state president kalraj mishra has welcomed the verdict of the lucknow bench of the allahabad high court for daily hearing of the ram janambhoomi case, adding that the verdict was a validation of the serious efforts by the centre to solve this problem. mishra said that in the larger interest of country, the central government had made serious efforts for speedy solution of the ayodhya dispute and the verdict of the high court was a confirmation of the government efforts. he alleged that the so-called secular parties must be hurt as they were utilising the ram janambhoomi dispute to malign the image of the majority community and take political advantage. he also condemned those organisations which opposed the central government initiatives to move a petition in the high court for daily hearing of the ayodhya dispute without being any party in the case. he said those organisations would be in a state of shock which wanted this dispute to continue for indefinite period of time. he appealed to both the parties concerned to cooperate with the high court in order to solve this matter peacefully and abort the nefarious designs of those elements who wanted to take political advantage from this issue.	0	0	0	0	0

"This story is from March 21, 2002  ahmedabad: twenty days after the riots broke out in the state, there were no official estimates available about the actual damage done to the properties belonging to minority community. even the officials at gujarat state wakf board (gswb) and gujarat minorities finance and development corporation limited (gmfdcl) offices, which were burnt down during the riots, are still trying to come to terms with their own losses. both the organisations are unaware of the exact damage done to minorities'' establishments. one of the reasons cited for the inordinate delay in assessing damage was absence of some senior officials, who have gone to mecca on haj pilgrimage. the gswb office at block number 7 of the old secretariat building still wears a ghostly look with its charred surroundings. ""the telephone connection was restored only three days back and we are attending office without any work,"" says mohammed yasin, a clerk with gswb sitting in a blackened room with burnt files kept in the racks. the chief executive officer''s chamber, which was completely gutted, had a master-computer storing important records. officials of the board claim that up to 75 per cent of records including service books of officers have been damaged in the fire. besides, annual reports on 15,000 minority institutions including madarssas registered with the board also went up in flames. and at the gmfdcl, the managing director''s office was reduced to ashes.

This story is from March 27, 2002  mumbai: if you can''t follow the piper, go to the guy doling out the piping hot tea.  for in the quest for hayath bansuriwala, telephones are impotent and street names are irrelevant. but the chaiwala or chana vendor around the corner might prove unexpectedly knowledgeable. ``leave a message for me anywhere,'''' says this musician-on-the-move airily. ``you can tell majnu bansuriwala in juhu. or the man who writes names on rice outside the museum. or, you know the chai shop in colaba which is frequented by foreigners? leave me a note with the bearded paanwala outside. i never stay in one place for very long, but i get my messages.''''  meet mumbai''s very own rolling stone__a man whom few know by name, but many identify by melody. for everyday, this itinerant flute peddler loops through the leafy lanes of churchgate, the palio-lined streets of nariman point and the multicultural melee of colaba. his plaintive bansuri weaves into the sizzle of frying onions and the hubbub of hawkers and then moves on, leaving behind a smidgen of raag pancham or bhairavi. ``on days he doesn''t come i miss his music,'''' says sharada dwivedi, city historian and resident of the churchgate area. ``like the trr, trr of those guys who clean the cotton in mattresses and the pipes of the snake charmers, this is a sound i associate with the past.''''  hayath is one of about 50 bansuriwalas who wander the city with their distinctive burdens__ long bamboos from which sprout hundreds of flutes. while most manage a recognisable rendition of mitva, oh mitva, however, only a few venture into the realms of classical music. ``hari prasad chaurasia is the most famous bansuri player in the world,'''' says hayath. ``and i am probably the best-known on the streets of mumbai.''''  tall claim though it may be, this skinny peddler in his well-worn shirt and scuffed chappals has his fans__ ranging from shivkumar, the portly palmist outside jehangir art gallery, to veteran film-maker yash chopra. not to forget the ``kala ghoda madams''''. ``he was floating around one day and sounded so good that we asked him to play through the kala ghoda festival,'''' says jyoti poddar, one of the organisers. ``the faint, peaceful music added to the mood.''''  adds the garrulous shivkumar, ``the angrez log who came to the festival went mad over him.''''

"new delhi: the national conference has asked the nda senior partner bjp to take stringent action against its mp vinay katiyar for his alleged remarks about the holy relic in the famous hazratbal shrine in srinagar. the issue has been taken up very seriously by almost every nc mp with minister of state for external affairs omar abdullah, who himself raised it on the sidelines of the nda meeting on wednesday night, sources said. however, bjp mps have denied that katyar ever made such a statement. even prime minister vajpayee, replying to questions in the rajya sabha, sought to clarify that katyar had issued a denial and requested mps not to go by media reports. some mps raised the issue while seeking clarification from him on the government''s stand on the ayodhya imbroglio. earlier, omar abdullah had asked bjp chief whip vijay kumar malhotra to take appropriate action against katiyar for his intemperate remarks. talking to some journalists, abdullah said, ""we have been very quiet over several issues and now i think that other parties have taken us for granted. but such a remark will not go unnoticed."" ""in jammu and kashmir, we have a strong bond of secularism and such a remark is infringing on the faith of lakhs of people and a deliberate act to stoke communal fire,"" abdullah said. people in srinagar took to the streets on wednesday to protest katyar''s remarks that the holy relic at the shrine was not that of prophet mohammad but of a hindu dharam guru. j&k chief minister farooq abdullah, condemning katiyar''s remarks, called upon the prime minister and home minister advani to take a serious note of the issue besides demanding his arrest. a report from jammu said the issue caused a ruckus in the state assembly on thursday as the day''s sitting started. as question hour was about to begin, national conference chief whip mubarak gul said that the bjp mp''s theory about the moo-e-muqaddas (holy hair) had created an atmosphere of mistrust and communal tension. he went further and stated that the vhp and the bjp were ""communalising the situation"" with regard to the ram janmabhoomi issue. he said that he hoped that the words of prime minister atal behari vajpayee would be matched by the actions of his party. upon this, the ruling party and opposition members, except those of the bjp, rose and raised their voice for communal harmony. later, there was a verbal duel between the bjp members, ""aap aag lagane walo ho (you are the ones fuelling the fire)"", to which a couple of bjp members shot back, ""aap pakistani ho (you are pakistanis)"". speaker abdul ahad vakil intervened to restore calm. he said the members should control their temper and words.

This story is from March 15, 2002  new delhi: the bjp-led government went into a spin on thursday night after ramjanmabhoomi nyas chief ramchandra paramhans announced his determination to kill himself if the government receiver did not permit his act of 'shila daan'. with the vishwa hindu parishad/rjn hardening its position and even the rss no longer sympathetic, the government was down on its knees. first, home minister lk advani had a half an hour-long telephonic conversation with vhp chief ashok singhal, to ask him to use his persuasive skills with paramhans to get him to withdraw his suicide threat, so that the government is not compelled to arrest him for his own safety. simultaneously, an sos was sent to rss leaders -- who are camping in bangalore for their akhil bharatiya karyakari mandal -- to talk to paramhans directly. finally, even the caste card was used, with former uttar pradesh chief minister rajnath singh and foreign minister jaswant singh issuing a joint appeal to fellow thakur, paramhans. if the government had thought wednesday's court ruling would -- if temporarily -- take care of its worries, thursday's developments clearly proved it wrong. all day, senior government ministers tried unsuccessfully to persuade the vhp/rjn to defer the march 15 programme till after june 2, conveying to them that the interim period could be used to mobilise the sort of public opinion that even the court might take heed of, when it gives its next ruling after 10 weeks. initially, reports that the supreme court was going to issue clarifications in its order of wednesday raised hopes that some ceremony would be permitted. but once it was clear that legally, nothing was possible, the vhp issued an ultimatum: vhp functionary pravin togadia warned that if parmahans was prevented from handing over the 'shila' or there was any firing, it would be the signal for ''crores of karsewaks'' to proceed towards ayodhya. in any case, on friday, at 2.15 pm, 'karsewaks' would conduct 'sankirtan' in temples or roads in towns/villages across the country. and finally, he said they no longer wanted to begin temple construction on the acquired land; now, they wanted the disputed spot itself. indeed, patience in the saffron brotherhood appeared to be running out. rss sources pointed to the resolution adopted in bangalore on friday which said the court verdict had hurt the ''sentiments of millions of hindus''. further, it exhorted the government to permit ''ramsevaks'' to go to karsevapuram in ayodhya to offer 'purnahuti' on march 24, adding,''no social harmony can be achieved by litigation or by deployment of forces. it can be accomplished by respecting each other's sentiments.'' it also asked swayamsevaks to mobilise public opinion for the construction of the ram temple. as reports came in from gorakhpur of 1,000-odd karsewaks led by bjp mp adityanath being arrested, swami chinmayananda, bjp mp and member of the ramjanmabhoomi niramn samiti, said, ''these ministers don't understand the depth of the ram agitation. up is a virtual minefield today.''	0	1	1	0	0

This story is from March 23, 2002  ahmedabad: gujarat high court has made it clear that its earlier orders regarding maintenance of lakes do not restrain the ahmedabad municipal corporation and ahmedabad urban development authority from permitting reconstruction of the buildings damaged, collapsed or demolished as a consequence of the earthquake. a division bench comprising justice bc patel and justice da mehta passed this order following applications seeking modification of its earlier orders. it was submitted by the petitioners that the buildings demolished, collapsed or damaged due to earthquake are required to be reconstructed as per the plans. the buildings were in existence prior to the earthquake and therefore they should be permitted to be built in accordance with the provisions of the bombay provincial municipal corporation act, the applications said. the court said it was of the opinion that as the buildings were already in existence, the affected persons are required to be permitted to reconstruct the buildings. these buildings were damaged, collapsed or required to be demolished due to the earthquake. reconstruction has to be done in accordance with the bye-laws, building regulations, rules and regulations applicable. pointing out that the state government has not placed any material on record in accordance with its earlier order, the court asked the government to submit a report as directed. the court observed that not just the state but also the corporations, development authorities, local authorities and others have failed in discharging their duties of maintaining waterbodies. the court had earlier given an order to maintain all waterbodies like lakes, ponds, rivers and canals and prevent their pollution. the court had also ordered to remove encroaches from such places and resettle them. the court had then ordered the municipal, urban development area and the government authorities of ahmedabad and the state government to ensure that all such waterbodies are maintained, used for the same purpose only and all unauthorised constructions around them be removed. the authorities have been directed not to allow any construction whatsoever within 500 metres of the lakes and ponds if their size is less than 5,000 sq mts. no construction should be allowed within 1,000 mts if the size of the lake or pond is above 5,000 sq mts.	0	0	0	0	0

"This story is from March 31, 2002  mumbai: as the plague of communal hatred ravages gujarat and threatens other parts of the country, attempts are under way to understand the pathology of this deadly disease. realising that the ayodhya virus is only part of the problem, social scientists are wondering why some groups are more susceptible than others. at a seminar hosted by mumbai university and the all india muslim obc organisation this week, eminent muslim academics from across the country turned their scrutiny inwards. while the three-daylong meet was organised to discuss the problems of the muslim backward castes, many presentations and discussions turned to the overwhelming questions of the moment. why are indian muslims always projected as a single, monolithic group without cultural and social variations? why does the community allow a handful of self-styled leaders to hijack important issues? why are all attempts at debate and discussion squashed so summarily? ""itaEUR(tm)s a bad time for muslims in india because of the growing sense of insecurity and vulnerability,"" says imtiaz ahmed, the well-known sociologist at jawaharlal nehru university in delhi. ""the big challenge ahead is the need to understand that communalism cannot be fought with communalism. alternate approaches are essential, but the present leadership will not allow it."" indeed,many problems stem from a leadership which is neither representative nor empathetic. instead of encouraging the community to break out of mental and physical ghettoes, these masters of manipulation feed fears and suspicions. ""bodies like the all india muslim personal law board (aimplb) and the haj committee claim to speak on behalf of the community, but are monopolised by a handful of upper-class, upper-caste muslims who want to safeguard their positions of power,"" says anwar alam,an academic with jnu,who presented a paper on the need for democratisation within the muslim community. ""they have deliberately fostered a culture of blind obedience and stifled dissent by raising the hoax cry of aEUR~islam in dangeraEUR(tm)."" concurs m.a. kalam, a wellknown anthropologist with the university of madras, ""anybody who dares question their stand is attacked."" even the smallest deviation from orthodoxy is greeted with shrieks of protest, ensuring that larger issues are left unchallenged. ""i recently started a column for a hindi newspaper, but it was discontinued after three weeks,"" says mr ahmed, who unwittingly ruffled feathers while responding to a question about whether it was okay for a muslim to touch the feet of an elder while saying salaam. ""i explained that while salaamaEUR(tm) is a religious tradition, touching feet is a valid cultural tradition.this caused a huge uproar.there is just no room for debate within the community."" little wonder, then, that only reactionary voices are heardaEUR""and so tend to define the aEUR~muslim standaEUR(tm) on critical issues like ayodhya. ""you will oftenfind hindus disagreeing with the vhp. but you rarely find muslims publicly objecting to the stand of the all india muslim personal law board,"" says mr ahmed, who has filed a case in the supreme court, protesting about the governmentaEUR(tm)s willingness to negotiate with the likes of the vhp and aimplb, but not with the other, liberal factions. ""ayodhya is irrelevant to the average muslim. but these leaders insist on projecting it as an issue central to the identity and existence of indian muslims."" this exploitation of emotive issues worries many observers. ""the muslim political leadership tries to create symbols of identityaEUR""like muslim personal law or the status of urduaEUR""and then uses them to whip up sentiments,"" says s. zainuddin, a sociologist with aligarh muslim university. concurs mr alam, ""these symbols create the sense of a single aEUR~indian muslimaEUR(tm) identity and hide the immense diversity in the community."" the kaleidoscopic nature of the indian muslim community was highlighted by numerous anthropological papers presented during the three-day-long seminar. so, for example, the dudekula muslims of andhra pradesh, whose women wear kumkum and who name their children after consulting their horoscopes, have little to do with the conventional stereotype of the indian muslim. likewise, the banjara muslims of deccan have virtually nothing in common with the matrilineal moplahs of kerala or the trader bohras of gujarat. ""in muslim gujarat alone, there are 130 categories listedaEUR""from the sunni vohra to the khatri and mussalman,"" says journalist praful bidwai, who was one of the speakers at the seminar. ""itaEUR(tm)s important to emphasise this pluralism."" cultural differences apart, fairly strict caste system holds swayaEUR""ensuring that a sheikh or syed is unlikely to marry qureshi or bagban. ""when i started discussing these aspects, i was accused of being an agent of the bjp and trying to create dissension in the community. i was told that islam doesnaEUR(tm)t recognise castes and inequalities,"" says ali anwar, a journalist who has written extensively about the often pathetic plight of muslim obcs. adds mr ahmed, ""all fundamentalist movements thrive on the notion of a monolith. so, both the orthodox muslim leadership and the vhp want to project the community as a single unit."" liberal muslims believe that the only way to counter the disease of fundamentalism is by injecting strong dose of vitamin daEUR""acknowledgment of diversity, democratisation and debateaEUR""into the community. ""it is essential to create an alternate voice,"" says mr ahmed. ""after 1992, a few liberal movements did spring up. i, myself, go from town to town, district to district to conduct meetings in the community. sometimes i am greeted with anger. but at least tradition of debate is taking shape in the community. this is an important first step to a liberal, secular future."""	0	0	0	0	0

new delhi: the fact that the shila daan ceremony went off without any last-minute hitch is a reflection of the extensive behind-the-scenes manoeuvering of the last few weeks in an effort to arrive at a negotiated settlement to the ayodhya dispute. the past two weeks have, in fact, seen the pmo fan out and contact several religious leaders from different akharas and maths as far removed as rishikesh, haridwar, udipi, puri and kanchi. for officials in the pmo, it was a do-and-die situation considering that both state and central governments have toppled over this temple issue. not only have they been on a damage control exercise by speaking to religious leaders from different walks of life but they personally supervised events as they unfolded in ayodhya on march 15. at 2 pm, a phone call from ayodhya informed a top aide that mahant ramchandra paramhans, ashok singhal and kar sewaks have set-off with two shilas from karsewakpuram. at 3.15 pm another frantic call asking that orders be issued for two kar sewaks to be allowed at a time to walk up to digambar akhara. instructions are dutifully relayed back to the concerned bureaucrat. a stampede must be best avoided. fifteen minutes later, the shilas was handed over to pmo observer shatrughan singh and everyone was breathing a sigh of relief. the prime ministeraEUR(tm)s tactful handling was greatly appreciated. infact, he is referred to as pragnya sitha (one who is not disturbed by what goes on around him). he even met the kanchi kamakoti shankaracharya swami jayendra saraswati four times, and is reported to have thanked him vociferously saying, aap ne bahut baada kaam kar diya (you have helped civil society by helping to start a dialogue between the different factions). in the same way, a key pmo official held several low profile meetings with mujahidul islam oasmi, president of the muslim personal law board (mplb)and an expert on shariat law. oasmi was then admitted to apollo hospital and the meetings -vp singh style- were held there. home minister advani was anxious that mumbai-based muslim lawyer yusuf muchala, who has been cross-examining him for the liberhan commission, be involved in this dialogue. muchala was contacted and is known to have had several meetings with the kanchi shankaracharya. pmo officials interacted closely with the rss and especially madan das devi who played a key role as an interlocutor between the government and the vhp. the rss are not keen that the vhp gain too much mileage from this issue. once the supreme court had given its verdict on thursday, the pmo knew their entire effort had to be focused on molifying paramhans. advani, defence minister george fernandes and s gurumurthy were called into the act to ensure all confrontation with the centre was avoided. in december 1992, when thousands of kar sewaks were winding their way to ayodhya, vajpayee chided them with the words. aEUR~aEUR~you must remember you are not going to lanka. you are going to ayodhya, a city where there can be no yodha,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he said in several of his public meetings. buty december 6 proved him wrong. the country is waiting to see if the kar sewaks and the vhp will heed him now.

""there is no way you can evaluate the damage to the mosque,"" says afzal khan of the sunni muslim wakf board, under whose jurisdiction the muhafiz khan masjid fell.

''keka'' shastri, as he is better known, has seen it all since 1905 when he was born in mangrol in junagadh district. and he says the current animosity between hindus and muslims was primarily a post-partition phenomenon which started in ahmedabad and has now spread to the whole state. while he calls the godhra train attack as ''pre-planned'', he is also quick to point out that the backlash all over the state was ''spontaneous''. ""this (post-godhra riots) was tit for tat and this tidal wave of destruction was needed,"" he says. shastri says he feels for the first time hindus from all sections had outpoured their anger over what happened in godhra. ""the mobs consisted of people of cultured families for the first time, besides the poor and the lower classes who have experienced riots often in the past,"" he says. this, he said, was such a groundswell of anger and retribution that it just wasn''t possible for the government to control it. ""narendra nirdosh chhe"" (narendra is innocent), he says about the chief minister''s role in the riots. ""if there is anybody to blame for letting things out of control it is p c pande (the police commissioner) who showed slackness in this whole episode,"" says shastri. asked whether the police was slack because the bjp and its government was backing the ''bandh'' on february 28, he replied, ""the bandh was supposed to be a means of protest, but nobody planned or imagined violence on this scale, it was the duty of the police to control the mobs. did you expect narendra to go to pande''s residence and tell him to control the situation?"". shastri says in every riot in gujarat, it is the muslims who have provided the first spark, like it happened in godhra. ""in the 1985 riots, the hindus were at the receiving end for almost one month till they hit back,"" he recalls. this time it was like a ''tidal wave'' which swept everything aside in a matter of three days. ""the provocation in godhra was so grave that the retaliation was also very quick and deadly,"" he says. but he denies that vhp and bajrang dal were involved in the killings. ""maybe it is true in one or two places, but by and large this was the response of the hindu society, not the organisation,"" he claims. he is all praise for his ''disciple'', dr praveen togadia, a former vhp general secretary in gujarat under him, who has risen in his ranks. ""his sacrifice is supreme, he has given up his thriving practice as a surgeon and his clinic at bapunagar to serve the hindu society, he will certainly go very far because he is extremely intelligent and has an excellent memory,"" he says. after the supreme court order on wednesday, banning the march 15 puja, prof shastri says the vhp is ""awaiting orders from the saints"" on what to do next. he says he would like to see not only a ram temple in ayodhya during his lifetime but also a krishna temple at mathura and mahadev temple at kashi where mosques now exist. ""if sardar vallabhbhai patel had lived longer we wouldn''t have had to wait for so long,"" he said.  "	0	0	1	1	0
"new delhi: shankaracharya of puri swami nishchalanand saraswati on saturday favoured construction of a ram temple at ayodhya through consensus but maintained that ""such issues are outside the purview of courts"". talking to reporters here, the shankaracharya said the solution to the vexed ayodhya tangle evaded the country ever since the congress began to take an ""ambiguous stand on anything pertaining to the hindu community"". ""it was the home minister of a congress government, sardar vallabhai patel who facilitated the reconstruction of somnath temple. unlocking of the doors of the ayodhya structure, shilanyas for a ram temple and the demolition of the mosque too took place during that party''s rule,"" the shankaracharya said adding that the situation changed after that party ""began taking ambiguous stands owing to electoral compulsions"". the pontiff urged prominent political parties to give ayodhya issue top priority and ""evolve a solution through consensus setting an example of mutual co-operation and adjustment, as such issues are outside the purview of courts"". he said it was not ""appropriate to make the birthplace of ram a centre of power struggle and conflict"". nishchalanand did not discount the possibility of all four shankaracharyas in the country coming together in future to solve the ayodhya tangle.

"This story is from March 25, 2002  gandhinagar: succumbing to pressure from the nda allies on the bjp-led government at the centre, the gujarat government on friday decided to defer implementing provisions of the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) against the accused of the godhra train massacre till investigations prove they are terrorists. so far, the police have booked 62 people in godhra under the ''draconian'' law. friday''s move sent shock-waves through a section of the state police, which thought the blanket use of poto against all accused in the train massacre would help investigations as well as prosecution. while the move has apparently been taken on the directions of the centre, chief minister narendra modi said in a statement that the decision was taken after obtaining legal opinion of the advocate general. the legal opinion says, ""it would be advisable to prosecute the accused under the general laws, and the application of poto could be deferred till the investigation is complete."" modi said the state government had, therefore, asked the godhra district superintendent of police to prosecute the accused of the massacre under general laws and the ipc. ""if on investigation the facts constituting offence under poto are prima facie established, the prosecution can also be proceeded or pursued under poto, if thought fit,"" he said. the chief minister''s decision is being interpreted here as a direct result of the hue and cry in parliament that poto is being selectively used against the godhra accused and not against the perpetrators of the post-godhra riots. despite the step backward, modi sought to present a bold face, indicating he was forced to take the hard decision as ""a very systematic and organised attempt is going on to malign the government of gujarat with regard to the godhra incident and its aftermath."" he claimed, ""those who are indulging to create the hue and cry against the gujarat government are doing it with a specific objective to malign and defame the government."" the chief minister said, ""allegations are being made that action has been taken only against those involved in the godhra incident, whereas no action is being taken against those involved in subsequent incidents. those making such allegations are doing it maliciously without verifying the facts. ""more than 10,000 arrests, including preventive ones, have been made till now. necessary action and arrests in all major incidents have been taken in a very prompt manner."" to substantiate his point, modi said, ""twentynine people have been arrested in the naroda incident, 18 in the gulbarg society case, 46 in the sardarpura (mehsana) violence, and 27 in the pandarwada incident."" he added that statements have been made by prominent persons that no action has been taken in these cases. such statements, besides bringing bad name to the government, fuel suspicion in the minds of the people which in turn becomes a stumbling block in attempts to restore normalcy. this is the second time that the bjp government in the state has had to go back on its discriminatory outlook towards the godhra incident and the subsequent riots. earlier, it had announced a compensation of rs 2 lakh for the godhra victims and rs 1 lakh for those killed in the post-godhra riots. however, that decision was withdrawn and a uniform compensation of rs 1 lakh announced after protests."	0	1	1	0	0

""is it a threatening call to the muslim minority of india or a big brother attitude of the majority?"" he asked. on monday, the trinamul congress, samata party and janata dal (united) had reacted sharply to saturday''s attack on the orissa assembly, demanding a ban on the sangh outfits vishwa hindu parishad and the bajrang dal. another ally, the telugu desam party had stopped short of asking for a ban but suggested that the government rein in the organisations. allied leaders say they feel vajpayee is under pressure from his party and tends to succumb to it. sending a senior official to receive the shilas (carved stones) from the ram janmbhoomi nyas last week, the allies felt, was one such sign of weakness. they have repeatedly sought to remind the government in the words of trinamul chief mamata banerjee: ""it is not a bjp government. it is an nda government.""

This story is from March 16, 2002  lucknow: the ayodhya impasse has hit the lucknowites hard. the restrictions on movement of people has almost dried up the supply of vegetables in local marts from barabanki and faizabad. this has created a wide gap between the demand and supply and the prices have sky rocketed. as most of the vegetable marts in trans gomti area - dandahiya in aliganj, nishatganj and indiranagar - get supply from barabanki, the business here has witnessed a slump. aEURoefollowing restrictions on the movement of people, the supply of vegetables has come down drastically,aEUR informed jaddan, a vegetable vendor in aliganj. the trend has been the same for the last two days as farmers have preferred to remain indoors rather than face the hustle and bustle of the security set-up, he said. prices of almost all the vegetables have shot up. while potato was selling at rs 12 per two kgs against wednesdayaEUR(tm)s rs 10 for the same, tomato prices have shot up to rs 18-19 per kg from rs 12-13 couple of days back. cucumber, which had just started coming, was absent. gourd, all types of saag (leaf vegetables), pumpkin, carrot, radish and others were all up by rs 3-5 per kg. brinjal was selling at rs 20-25 per kg, parval rs 15 kg, lady fingers rs 20 per kg and cauliflower was absent. people shopping for potato to prepare papads and chips for holi too complained of sky rocketing prices. most of them have postponed their plans. another reason why farmers are avoiding business during the disturbance is the undue harassment by police on roads, disclosed another shopkeeper in nishatganj. the daily business of nishatganj, aliganj and indiranagar marts taken together is around rs 3-5 lakh. but the deserted looks and heavy prices have brought the business down to rs 1 lakh, claimed vendors. aEURoepeople are also avoiding large purchases hoping that prices would come down after march 15 impasse,aEUR they said.	0	0	1	0	0
This story is from March 25, 2002  pune: in a bid to avoid further confrontation with the peasants and workers party (pwp), which recently threatened to pull out of the ruling democratic front in the state, ncp chief sharad pawar admitted his partyaEUR(tm)s failure to back the pwp candidate for the raigad zilla parishad presidentaEUR(tm)s post. pawar was addressing his first press conference in the city since mid february. aEURoethe pwpaEUR(tm)s extreme stand against ncp minister sunil tatkare was understandable since ncp members did not vote for the pwp candidate as promised.aEUR tatkare, who finally resigned from the state cabinet under pressure from deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal (ncp),has also accepted moral responsibility for the incident, pawar said. aEURoetatkare has also assured that his supporters will not do anything to further complicate the issue and will abide by the partyaEUR(tm)s stand on the issue,aEUR said pawar, underplaying doubts about discontent in the ncpaEUR(tm)s raigad camp caused by tatkareaEUR(tm)s ouster. in the forthcoming joint session of parliament called by the bjp-led nda government to pass the controversial poto bill, pawar said he would vote for it as the goverment had already made the amendments he had suggested earlier. the recommendations under poto are now fairly balanced and focus primarily on curbing cross-border terrorism sponsored by pakistan, he said. he criticised the congress for opposing poto without sound reason. he questioned the sincerity of the congress in opposing poto when states governed by it were already using laws tougher than the bjp-proposed ordinance. aEURoethe congress government in the state has already implemented the maharashtra control of organised criminal activities (mcoca) which is much stronger than poto. even karnataka, ruled by a congress government has a similar law in place,aEUR he pointed out. about the gujarat governmentaEUR(tm)s alleged attempt to misuse poto, pawar deplored chief minister narendra modiaEUR(tm)s handling of the communal riots. aEURoethe law should be implemented uniformly against the perpetrators of the godhra carnage as well as those involved in the subsequent riots,aEUR said the man who had handled a similar situation in the aftermath of communal riots in mumbai in 1992. but he complimented prime minister atal behari vajpayee for his adept handling of the ayodhya crisis. the precautionary measures taken by the government prevented any untoward incident there, he said.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 27, 2002  amritsar:the ideological gulf between the parent and the splinter akali factions is likely to further widen, with shiromani akali dal extending support to prevention of terrorism act (pota), in the joint session of both houses, held on march 26. while former punjab chief minister parkash singh badal heads sad, a major splinter group, all india shiromani akali dal (aisad), is reportedly considering floating a condemnation resolution against pota, during the budget session of shiromani gurdwara parbandhak committee (sgpc), scheduled to held on march 30. veteran akali leaders here say this was the first time when a major akali faction had supported a contentious bill that contained aEUR~antidemocraticaEUR(tm) features. they maintain akalis have always vouched for the protection of human rights of minorities in the country. however, in the changing political scenario of akali groups, these veteran akali leaders anticipate an uproarious budget session. former higher education minister in badalaEUR(tm)s government and a senior leader of aisad, manjit singh calcutta, while talking to the times of india here on wednesday, said akalis have always been in favour of protecting the rights of minority communities and they had staged various morchas (agitations) for the cause. firing a salvo against badal, he said, by extending support to a draconian bill, badal had brought disgrace to the glorious past of akalis. he alleged badal was playing into the hands of bjp for his own political interests, ignoring the rich traditions of akalis. calcutta also took the senior bjp leadership to task and alleged that they had failed to provide security to muslims, which was evident from the recent gujarat riots. instead of making security arrangements for them, the government was instead putting them behind bars,he alleged. he said aisad may bring a resolution in sgpcaEUR(tm)s budget session, condemning pota and the targeting of muslims in gujarat. sources revealed that other splinter groups like panthic akali dal and akali dal amritsar would support aisad on the issue. in the wake of recent developments in the tohra camp, it is believed that the badal camp would decide its course of action in a significant meeting of sgpc members loyal to him. the meeting has been convened on the eve of the budget session by sgpc president kirpal singh badungar, whereby badal himself would address the members.	0	1	1	1	0
ahmedabad: officials working closely with chief minister narendra modi have expressed surprise at his remarks before the media here on wednesday that no officer was victimised for doing a good job during the ongoing riots. while modi said these were not punishment transfers but only promotion transfers, officials point out that all the four officials whose transfers the director general of police k chakravarthi had objected to had been simply shifted, without promotions. while the chief minister classified all the transfers as promotion tranefers, the main objection had come with respect to the shifting of vivek shrivastava, sp kutch, himanshu bhatt, sp banaskantha, m d antani , sp bharuch and rahul sharma, sp bhavnagar. none of these officers, who performed well in controlling the riots, have got a promotion. while the police establishment had pleaded that the four officials should be allowed to continue at least till the holi festivities were over, the chief minister insisted that these officials should be relieved with immediate effect. all the four officials have in fact been relieved from their present assignments and the ips officers have decided to take up the matter at an emergency meeting to be held shortly. the chief minister also sought to give the impression that things were normal in gujarat by explaining that nearly 3000 haji pilgrims has reached their homes safely after completing their pilgrimage and nearly 1000 tazia processions were taken out in gujarat during moharram . however, officials said that this was hardly a sign of normalcy as the hajis had to be escorted back home under unprecedented security and in an atmosphere filled with tension while most of the tazia processions in the big cities had to be cancelled.

"This story is from March 25, 2002  jamdudhai: ""i am not the custodian of the vajpayee government nor am concerned whether it stays in power or not. the ram mandir will be constructed at any cost. the government can go if it cannot fulfill the wishes of the people in india,"" said international general secretary of the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp), pravin togadia. in an exclusive interview to this correspondent here, togadia blamed the pseudo secularism and indian polity for the present crisis in the state. excerpts from the interview: why did the vhp give up its hardline stand on ayodhya at the last moment? pt: the vhp has always stood for tolerance. the vhp is not a militant organisation and we haven''t given up our stand. besides that, the vhp has achieved what it had intended. some people wanted the vhp to continue this hardline stand so that there could be bloodbath in ayodhya and then they could renew their demand for a ban on the vhp. the vhp went according to its plan without offending the supreme court ruling and also avoided the bloody clashes which many desired. now that the first stage of the vhp programme is over, what is the future plan of the vhp vis-a-vis temple construction? we would like to have a central legislation enacted, allowing construction of ram temple at ayodhya according to vhp plan. we plan to have a public opinion in favour of the ram temple. we want the government policies to be pro-ram and not anti-ram. all out efforts would be made to garner public support for the temple construction. the temple issue has not been solved and we won''t settle for anything less than a ram temple irrespective of the court verdict. the court cannot decide the future of the hindus in hindustan, and whom to worship and where. did the parliament and the supreme court change its stand on the shah bano case and if yes, then it will have to change for the construction of the ram temple also. do you regret the violence, post-godhra? the post-godhra violence was a natural reaction for the attack on the yatris on way to amarnath, attack on sabri mala in kerala, attack on hindus in jammu and kashmir. for the gujarat violence, i would blame the pseudo secularism and indian polity. india has followed a one-way secularism. the secularism has not defended the hindus but has defended the muslims and islam. the indian polity is slave of muslim vote bank. this is the last chance to change the indian polity and if it does not, there would be godhra-type incidents everywhere in india. to avoid such happenings, the government must be of the hindus and for the hindus. in this difficult times, why does the vhp want to rock the vajpayee government? i am not a custodian of the vajpayee government. i do not care if the government stays or goes. vajpayee had promised construction of the ram temple, but when the time for its implementation came, he backtracked as he wants to stay in power. no one can stay in power without the support of hindus, and who are we to rock the vajpayee government? the people will themselves turn it upside down if the wishes of hindus are not fulfilled. how to govern the alliance (nda) is not the concern of the vhp. we want the temple to be constructed. the government can go if it cannot fulfill this wish. how would you term the violence in gujarat? you cannot call it violence. it was a natural outburst of the merciless killing of innocent ramsevaks in godhra. what else one can expect when such an incident takes place in front of your eyes. it was simply tit for tat.

This story is from March 16, 2002  lucknow: even as the build-up in ayodhya had the entire nation on tenterhooks, there were some who were actually benefited by the vhp aEUR~potboileraEUR(tm). the bharat sanchar nigam limited (bsnl) being one of the aEUR~beneficiariesaEUR(tm). case in point: expansion of the wireless in local loop (will) telephone services and usage of the leftover equipments. conceding that the tension in ayodhya had rung in good tidings for the bsnl, the chief general manager up, east telecom circle, sp kalsi told times news network on friday that the department, courtesy the tension in the temple town, had managed to sell more than 60 of its will mobile systems in the twin cities of faizabad-ayodhya in the last fortnight alone. these instruments, sources said, were a spillover of the initial phase of will connections when the scheme was thrown open for public in the state capital on august 1, 2001. senior bsnl officials said that while they were mulling over ways to do away with the surplus instruments left after the closing of the deadline for the scheme, the ayodhya issue gained heat which came as a boon for them. the ayodhya-faizabad telecom circle is reportedly poor in mobile communication, as the sole service provider of mobile services in this region has poor phone network and connectivity is a big problem, said officials. it was here that the state government officials approached the bsnl top brass to come to their rescue, which they willingly did, much to their benefit. according to reliable sources, over three dozen will mobile connections were taken in the twin cities by government officials, which included bureaucrats from lucknow, commanding officers of central paramilitary forces like the crpf, bsf, cisf, raf and the local police. and the second highest users of the will services was the fourth estate which according to information available with the cgms office requisitioned around 11 sets, the rest of the demand basically came from influential businessmen of the temple town. confirming the upswing in the demand for will connections in the region and the benefit to the bsnl, sp kalsi said they were happy to note that aEURoein a situation of crisis like this they were able to perform their duties as communicators well enoughaEUR.	0	0	0	0	0

"This story is from March 24, 2002  mumbai: itaEUR(tm)s a tug-of-war between the powerful fishermen lobby and marine conservationists. the issue here is the ban on the hunting of sharks for their fins. the marine conservationists, led by organisations like mumbaibased reefwatch marine conservation (rwmc) and sanctuary magazine, are marshalling their resources to agitate against the modification of the july 2001 order which had put all sharks on schedule i of the wildlife act (which meant a blanket ban on their hunting), while the shark-fin export lobby is adamant that they will not stop hunting sharks, ban or no ban. at stake here is the survival of not only sharksaEUR""the species that occupy the apex position in the marine ecosystemaEUR""but even fragile marine life like groupers and coral reefs. responding to the intense agitation by marine scientists and conservationists, the union ministry of environment and forests brought a wide range of marine species including all types of sharks, corals, sea horses, sea fans, giant groupers and molluscs (shells) under the wildlife protection act in july last year. this was the first time that indiaaEUR(tm)s marine life had been placed under protection. the euphoria didnaEUR(tm)t last long. under pressure from the influential shark-fin export lobby, the government recently modified the ban, leaving out almost everything except nine species of sharks, citing socio-economic factors as a justification. says sarang kulkarni, marine biologist with rwmc, aEURoethese are the commercial type of sharks. they are not as important in the preservation of the ecosystem as the oceanic and reef sharks that have been left out.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) conservationists say that indiaaEUR(tm)s marine life is facing an sos-like situation. aEURoeindia, today, is the largest exporter of shark fins to the far east, which has depleted its resources and is now looking towards our shores. sharks are hunted for their fins, used to thicken soups in restaurants across the world and even eaten as a delicacy by indiaaEUR(tm)s rich and famous,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says mitali kakkar, director of rwmc. aEURoesometimes, fishermen throw back live sharks into the sea after cutting off their fins, forcing them to die a painful death by drowning since sharks need fins to swim.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) during recent coral reef survey projects conducted by reefwatch and united nations development project, no shark sightings have been recorded. considered the tiger of the ocean, sharks help maintain the marine ecosystem. any imbalance in their population affects fish stocks and ultimately the resources and livelihood of thousands of fishermen who are dependent on the marine wealth. kulkarni reveals that in malwan, on the konkan coast, he discovered even baby sharks finding their way into the nets of big trawlers.aEURoewe have seen shark fins the size of a thumbnail being dried,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he says. aEURoeso you can imagine the size of the baby sharks that are coming into the nets off the coast of maharashtra and goa.all the money from shark hunting goes to the middlemen and not to the small fishermen.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) arguing against the conservationists are the government and fishermen lobbies of coastal states like maharashtra, goa, kerala and gujarat, who say that the livelihood of several fishing families depends on shark hunting, which accounts for almost five per cent of indiaaEUR(tm)s total exports. aEURoefish stocks like pomfrets, mackerel, sea salmons are down,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) claims vijay bandarkar, president of the maharashtra macchimar kruti samiti. aEURoewe have no choice but to catch whatever gets us returns. ultimately, you canaEUR(tm)t talk about ecological conservation when the livelihood of so many fishermen is at stake.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) indeed, the issue at stake here is not only the survival of sharks but also the subsistence of a few lakh fishermen. pollution combined with fishing by foreign trawlers who, unlike traditional fishermen, catch fish even when they are spawning thus preventing juvenile fish from reaching maturity, has depleted stocks. conservationists admit that entire traditional coastal communities are on the brink of starvation and have no choice but to fish for products like shark fins which sell at about us $20,000 per ton in the international market. the solution probably lies in finding alternative means of livelihood for fishermen and restoring the ecological health of the seas. protecting predators at the apex is a part of this plan. aEURoewe do not want to rob the fishing community of their income,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) asserts kakkar, aEURoethat is not the idea at all.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) in malwan, for instance, reefwatch is conducting a survey to check if eco-tourism can be encouraged as an alternative. even in gujarat, where hunting for whale sharks is a major issue, the organisation has initiated a three-year project that suggests whale and shark watching expeditions as an eco-tourism activity, where fisher folk can use their boats to take tourists to watch whales. other long-term solutions could include cordoning off certain breeding grounds for a period of 3 to 5 years so that fish stocks are rejuvenated. aEURoethese could be opened for fishing activities after the lock-in period and another area could demarcated. there has to be a clear earmarking of trawler fishing zones so that they do not interfere with traditional fishing zones and take away from the catch of the smaller fishermen,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) points out kakkar. aEURoein this way, we can ensure sustainable fishing resources and practices.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm)"	0	0	0	0	0

"vadodara: the khaki uniform, the stars and the medals, the lathi and the bayonet aEUR"" nothing seems to evoke awe anymore. the police have seen a complete erosion in their authority in recent weeks despite rattling off statistics about how many rounds of fire and teargas shells they used to push back riotous mobs. as gujarat plunged into mayhem following the godhra carnage on february 27, the police lost their authority and also the faith the people had in them. so much so that even 20 days after the riots began, the mobs have no qualms in lynching their victims despite the police cover given to them. the erosion of faith perhaps began on day one itself, when an angry mob went on an assault-and-stabbing spree at vadodara railway station on february 27 as the ill-fated sabarmati express chugged in in even as 50 to 60 policemen watched. from then, till sunday evening, when an escort party of six policemen, three of them armed, virtually stood and watched a mob lynch two persons of the minority community and injure 20, the image of the police has been on a downslide. former city police commissioner jaspal singh, who is now with the samajwadi party, says: aEUR~aEUR~in this complete breakdown of the law and order machinery, the image of the police has got so badly battered that mobs are now killing their victims right in the presence of these men who donaEUR(tm)t have a leader left in the police force to inspire them.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) aEUR~aEUR~the escort team on sunday was outnumbered by the mob that kept surging and swelling. they did resort to a lathicharge, but to no avail. we were left at the mercy of the mob,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) said an injured person. he was one of the people who had fled their houses in the makarpura area of vadodara after february 28 and had returned to collect their belongings when the mob attacked them. and, the aggrieved now cut across communities. if a mob comprising women from the minority community gheraoed vadodara police commissioner d.d. tuteja on ajwa road on sunday, a huge group of women took to the streets on saturday afternoon despite curfew, singing ram dhun and protesting against alleged police excesses on the men folk of the salatwada area. two women were injured when the police burst teargas shells to disperse them. the lawlessness that gripped vadodara was also apparent when a group of tribals fired at the district collector and the superintendent of police recently when they were on a round in kawant taluka. what has further dented the policeaEUR(tm)s image is the interference by the political class, with bjp functionaries being seen at a number of places, aEUR~aEUR~guidingaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) policemen on the street on aEUR~aEUR~how and where to actaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). and, the ram dhun singing crowds too were virtually left untamed on friday. they meandered menacingly close to known sensitive areas and the policemen on duty did not act despite their provocative slogans that triggered fresh bouts of rioting.

This story is from March 16, 2002  lucknow: the rail and bus services to ayodhya will remain suspended for some more time. this was stated by principal secretary, home, naresh dayal while talking to mediapersons here on friday. he said that the security forces would also continue to man the disputed spot in the temple town despite the peaceful conduct of shila daan there on friday. claiming that the government was closely monitoring the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) activities in ayodhya, he said that the restrictions in the temple town would continue till the parishad decided to stop ram sevaks inflow to the twin towns of ayodhya and faizabad. he said that the government was taking no chance this time as any fresh development in ayodhya was bound to have national impact. replying to a query, he said that there was no need for calling people from across the country to take part in the ongoing purnahuti yagya. he said that the government could not transfer the acquired land to anybody following the supreme courtaEUR(tm)s verdict in this regard. dayal admitted that meerut and aligarh were tense but said that they had not received news of any untoward incident from these places or any other part of the state. besides, friday namaz also passed off peacefully, he added. he said that 33 vhp activists, led by giriraj kishore, bjp mp from gonda brij bhushan singh and sc dixit, were arrested on the lucknow-bara banki border while they were on their way to ayodhya. similarly, about 700 persons led by former minister satish mahana were arrested in kanpur, he said and added that 24 persons were arrested in deoria, 26 in hata and 40 at tariya sujan.  	0	1	1	0	0

"This story is from March 17, 2002  mumbai: imagine a scenario in which the recent bloodletting in gujarat has been secretly filmed by aliens in their flying machines. from the footage, what verdict would the little green men pass on us humans? that we love to burn our trains? that we love to drive in fancy cars as we go on looting expeditions? wouldn''t they be right in concluding that humans are nasty, brutish and tend to hide snarling faces, red in tooth and fang, beneath their smiling masks? many would regard such an indictment as bang on. curiously, such a view is not alien to anthropology either. ""with the early provocative description of australopithecus as a lustful killer and the appearance of konrad lorenz''s on aggression in 1967, the origins of violence became a central theme in debates about human social evolution,"" says frans b.m. de waal, a primatologist and author of the bestseller the ape and the sushi-master. ""popular authors (like robert ardry and desmond morris) spun the now familiar scenario according to which inborn aggressiveness, combined with male bonding in hunting and warfare, ''explains'' the human success story. ""the extraordinary appeal of this ''killer ape'' myth has been attributed to the horrors of world war ii,"" mr de waal adds. ""confidence in human nature was at a low after the war, and the view that we are murderous psychopaths, or a mentally unbalanced predator, threatening an otherwise harmonious natural realm, went down remarkably easily with scientists and the general public alike."" that extreme portrayal began to change with inputs brought in from the field by ethologists. these experts found that primate societies are characterised by cooperation. some species such as chimpanzees and humans did indulge in bouts of collective intercommunity violence. but more often than not, alliances were formed within the group, with two or more individuals banding together to defeat a third. as a result, high-ranking individuals were not necessarily those who were the strongest, fittest or most violent, but those who could mobilise support and foster valuable partnerships. at the same time, the way in which scientists look at the social impact of conflict also changed. earlier, research had focused on appeasement and reassurance gestures and had hinted at relationship repair after fights. ethologists presumed that primates evolved social graces to temper their aggression, as a way of kissing and making up after a fight to preserve group cohesion. reconciliation became the buzzword. ethologists believed that reconciliation allowed monkeys and apes to maintain tight kinship bonds despite frequent intrafamilial squabbles. but recent research has overturned that view. ""monkeys and apes are rather nice to each other most of the time,"" reports new scientist, ""and not just to make up after a fight."" at a recent conference organised by the american association for the advancement of science (aaas), paul garber from the university of illinois at urbana-champaign said few of the researchers who claim that social behaviour originated as a way to make up after a fight have actually examined how animals interact. by scouring existing data, dr garber and his colleagues measured the time spent on being social versus time spent on being aggressive. they found that old and new world monkeys and apes, as well as pre-simians like african bush babies and asian slow lories, spend only about five per cent of their time in any kind of social interaction. what''s more striking, aggression chest-beating, biting, scratching and other mayhem accounts for an extremely small percentage of these social interactions, usually less than one per cent. friendly behaviour is 20 times as common. according to dr garber, this suggests that social graces may be valuable in their own right. other studies also suggest that primates only make an attempt at reconciliation after fewer than one in five conflicts. this could also mean that as an evolutionary force, pure friendliness may be more potent than reconciliatory or obsequious behaviour. this is precisely what the sage of sabarmati, mahatma gandhi, preached. what we mustn''t forget is that the communal carnage occurred in the very state where he was born.

"This story is from March 27, 2002  kolkata: the interrogation of dubai-based don aftab ansari has shed some light on the motives behind the american center attack which left five policemen dead. the attack was actually planned by amir reza khan, brother of asif reza khan, who was killed in an encounter in gujarat. amir, who is also an aide of aftab ansari, wanted to avenge the death of his brother. amiraEUR(tm)s strong sentiments over his brotheraEUR(tm)s death suited aftabaEUR(tm)s purpose, which is why he agreed to provide logistic support. this was the gist of his aEUR~confessionaEUR(tm) to the police, deputy commissioner (detective department) soumen mitra said on monday. according to mitra, aftab had a twin objective aEUR"" to create an atmosphere where his name would strike terror, similar to that of dawood ibrahim. he perceived that the terror tag would help in the extortion of city businessmen and also to establish his credibility among the jehadis. however, he was not averse to exploiting the jehadisaEUR(tm) cause for his own gains. aEURoeaftab had plans to exploit the jehadis in the toughest of operations,aEUR he added. the american center attack was a difficult assignment. there was every chance of getting hurt or even killed and so aftab preferred to exploit men who were fired with enough zeal. he therefore sought out two pakistani jehadis, idris and zahid, to carry out the firing on police personnel. in a shrewd move, aftab chose the american center, which would have been a natural choice for the extremist lashkar-e-toiba or jaish-e-mohammed. aftab has reportedly told the police that amiraEUR(tm)s insistence on revenge led to aEURoeunnecessary hurry,aEUR resulting in aEURoesome basic flawsaEUR in the operation. aftab claimed that he was not in favour of attacking the police. after this revelation, kolkata police sleuths compiled charges against amir in the case. as he was still in dubai, they have forwarded the necessary documents to the cbi to start extradition proceedings. mitra said that soon after asifaEUR(tm)s arrest, amir fled to dubai. from there, he acted at the behest of aftab. asifaEUR(tm)s death proved to be a blow to aftab as far as his underworld business in india was concerned. he relied on amir. through him, aftab contacted his men like nasser, sadaqat and abdulla alias khoram khayam and asked them to provide logistic support for the action. amir was in sharjah at the time of the attack and informed aftab about the aEURoesuccessaEUR of the assignment. aftab told the police that amir was in touch with the attackers. aftab, in turn, called up a newspaper and a cid officer claiming the responsibility. quack lynched: a quack was beaten to death on suspicion of being a witch by residents of ballu gopalpur village in murshidabad district on monday."	0	0	1	0	0

"shimla: prime minister atal bihari vajpayee on sunday indicated no scaling down of india''s military mobilisation at the border saying pakistani spies were indulging in sabotage in the country and cross-border terrorism was continuing. ""india cannot take any chances with external and internal security as pakistani spies are indulging in sabotage, cross-border terrorism is continuing and there is no respite in firing along the border,"" vajpayee said. such actions did not indicate that pakistan was interested in peace, he told a rally here marking the completion of four years in office of bjp government led by prem kumar dhumal in himachal pradesh. he said pakistan must immediately stop cross-border terrorism and respond adequately to global call to stamp out terrorism. vajpayee said india wanted peace and better relations with pakistan but it must abide by simla accord and lahore declaration and settle all issues bilaterally. vajpayee said pakistan had signed the simla agreement after it lost the 1971 war with india to settle all issues, including kashmir, through bilateral talks but it violated the accord and indulged in kargil misadventure to taste another defeat. he said acts of terrorism like attack on parliament and jammu and kashmir assembly and firing from across the border raised doubts about pakistan''s intentions to have friendly relations with india. he commended security forces for repulsing the attack on parliament saying if terrorists had succeeded in their nefarious designs, there would have been a bloodshed. the security forces killed all the terrorists and saved not only parliament but also mps, vajpayee said. he asserted pakistan would never be allowed to gain control over kashmir. when pakistan could not retain bangladesh, it should stop dreaming of ""annexing"" kashmir.

This story is from March 26, 2002  mumbai: it will be a black day for democracy if the joint session of parliament votes in favour of prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) on tuesday, say activists and concerned citizens here.  although the government has dropped some sections of the ordinance since it was promulgated six months ago, those opposed to it say that the changes are cosmetic and that poto can be misused just like the terrorist and disruptive activities act (tada), which lapsed in 1995.  civil rights activists point out that a total of 77,571 people were detained under tada, of whom 72,000 were eventually let off because of lack of evidence. gujarat accounted for the maximum number of tada arrests (18,686), way ahead of states such as punjab (15,314) and j&k (11,616) where terrorists were active. and, the overall conviction rate under tada was less than one per cent.  ``poto gives the government sweeping powers and there is every chance of it being used selectively,'''' says former state education minister sadanand varde, pointing at the gujarat government''s decision to apply poto in the godhra case but not in the horrific riots that followed. he feels that the existing laws are sufficient to combat terrorism if the government shows enough will.  advocate yasmin shaikh says that such draconian laws are used against the minorities, as was evident during the 1992-''93 riots in mumbai. according to her, this ordinance does not check the police and it will make it easy for them to victimise people or extort money from them.  ``the government will simply get hold of a weapon to use against dissenters, trade unionists and other critics,'''' said former high court judge s.m. daud.  opponents of poto contend that draconian laws have not been able to stop terrorism. they point out that terrorists attacked the j&k assembly and parliament house despite poto being in force and that the neither the godhra incident nor the ensuing riots could be prevented. civil rights activists said that the government was in favour of harsher laws, despite a total lack of accountability on the part of the police.  ``poto does not define terrorism and we will have to accept the government''s definition of terrorism,'''' said teesta setalvad of people''s union for human rights. she is also opposed to sections in poto that allow the police to arrest anyone withholding information about terrorist activities.  justice daud pointed out that it is virtually impossible to establish if a police officer has applied poto maliciously as the government itself sanctions the arrest.  advocate b.k. subbarao said this ordinance makes it impossible for the judicial system to come to the rescue of poor victims. ``the law-enforcers will be above the law,'''' he said.  according to shakil ahmed of nirbhay bano andolan, the government should counter terrorism by providing better training and tools to policemen. ``why don''t they invest in police reforms, in forensics, in computerisation?'''' he asks.  ahmed said several people arrested under tada are still languishing in jails, even though they have not been convicted. he feels that people similarly arrested under poto will never be able to claim compensation from the government.	0	1	1	1	0
"This story is from March 18, 2002  lucknow:what was a satisfactory moment for the atal behari vajpayee government and the secular forces was an hour of reckoning for the vishwa hindu parishad-led ram janmabhoomi temple movement in ayodhya. as the restless karsewaks and sadhus jeered and heckled, ashok singhal, the working president of vishwa hindu parishad, vinay katiyar, the bjp mp, and mahant ramchandra das paramhans, the president of the ram janmabhoomi nyas, stood completely discredited. the refrain was that these three leaders of the temple movement were nothing more than confidence-tricksters and that no hindu will respond to their call in future. as singhal stood atop his car trying to explain the reasons for surreptitiously performing the shila daan to pmoaEUR(tm)s emissary shatrughan singh instead of the commissioner of faizabad division, one could see how ineffective he was in his attempt at winning back some of his, and that of the paramhansaEUR(tm)s, lost credibility. out of frustration and to avoid millions watch and later read about the embarrassing situation, singhal ordered the media out of the digambar akhada precincts. not so with vinay katiyar and the paramhans. katiyaraEUR(tm)s bravado was typical. nothing has been lost and the temple movement is right on course, he said while being surrounded by some media personnel and a couple of agitated karsewaks. whataEUR(tm)s next? that he did not want to disclose. aEURoejust wait and see.aEUR asked if the concernsaEUR"" supreme courtaEUR(tm)s order, bloodshedaEUR"" that prevented them from carrying out their threat would not come in the way of temple construction in future too, katiyar quite unusually said that everything would be done peacefully. the paramhans, whose fickleness had kept the administration on tenterhooks the whole of march 15, was emphatic in his own interpretation of success of his plan and was confident that aEURoenobody can stop the temple from being constructed.aEUR he did not elaborate how. where do you go from here? aEURoei am too tired and want to rest so iaEUR(tm)m putting the phone down.aEUR by the end of the day, karsewaksaEUR(tm) and sadhusaEUR(tm) disappointment had given way to disenchantment with the temple movement. going by the sentiments of those in ayodhya and faizabad, june 2, when the ongoing yagya is to end, may be a bigger flop show than the shila daan itself. as it is, there are no karsewaks even for the daily ahuti. and the locals believe that after the aEUR~disgraceful fridayaEUR(tm) none would be willing to come to ayodhya. the temple movement does appear to be disintegrating, unless fridayaEUR(tm)s drama was enacted keeping in mind some other opportune moment or a long term strategy. the ram janmabhoomi nyas itself is a divided house. its vice-president, mahant nrittya gopal das, has been conspicuously absent from the nyasaEUR(tm) activities. as he is away from the scene of activity, one doesnaEUR(tm)t know the reason for his aloofness. the nirmohi akhara headed by jagannath das is certainly not very happy at the way the vhp has hijacked the temple programme. it was the nirmohi akhara that had filed the first case way back in 1884 for putting up a canopy on the idols of ram and sita. they had lost the case but were allowed to bring the idols at the break of dawn and then remove them at sunset. with the akhara politics exposing the mahantsaEUR(tm) disunity, and political expediency and supreme courtaEUR(tm)s order thwarting vhpaEUR(tm)s game-plan this time, it would require a 1991-92-like frenzy to be rebuilt for the vhp to get the people to ayodhya once again. but then a mob can only destroy, whereas ayodhya needs reconstruction. in this sense, the vhp appears to have reached a dead-end on the construction of ram temple in ayodhya.

This story is from March 16, 2002  mumbai: in the wake of the ayodhya controversy, hindutva supporters in the u.s. have halted the screening in new york of two films made by noted director anand patwardhan which critically look at the ram phenomenon and hindu fundamentalism. one of the films, in the name of god, documents the rise of hindu fundamentalism as reflected by the temple\mosque conflict. the film won the national award for best documentary in 1992 and was telecast on doordarshan after a high court directive to the national network which had earlier refused to show the film. the other film,we are not your monkeys, is a music video featuring the poem of late dalit poet daya pawar, giving a dalit perspective to the ramayan story. the films were to be screened at the american museum of natural history. however, hindutva supporters brought pressure on the authorities by conducting a signature campaign and submitting a petition against their screening. in a chat with this newspaper, patwardhan said he was amused to note that the hindutva supporters had branded him a aEURoeself-proclaimed leftistaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). aEURoeactually, i am a humanist. the fundamentalists calculated that a strategy of red-baiting would work best with the american authorities,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he remarked. aEURoehistory teaches us that compromising with fundamentalist forces, no matter what their hue, only encourages them to become more extreme in their position. the irony of the situation is that both the films are not new ones. we are not your monkeys articulates a dalit critique of the caste system by deconstructing images and stories from the ramayan,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he said.	0	0	0	0	0
new delhi: during his recent interactions with the vishwa hindu parishad top brass, prime minister atal bihari vajpayee reminded them that ''a-yodh-ya'' was a city where no yodh (fighting) must take place. the fact that the shila daan ceremony went off without any last minute hitch is a reflection of the extensive behind-the-scenes manoeuvring that was going on during the last few weeks in an effort to arrive at a negotiated settlement to the ayodhya dispute. for officials in the pmo, it was a do-and-die situation considering that both state and central governments have toppled over the temple issue. not only did pmo officials start a damage control exercise by speaking to religious leaders from different walks of life but they personally supervised events as they unfolded in ayodhya on march 15. the past two weeks saw the pmo fan out and contact several religious leaders from different akharas and maths as far removed as rishikesh, haridwar, udipi, puri and kanchi. in the same way, a key pmo official held several low profile meetings with mujahidul islam oasmi, president of the muslim personal law board (mplb) and an expert on shariat law. oasmi was then admitted to apollo hospital and the meetings - vp singh style - were held there. once oasmi admitted his desire for a peaceful solution, it made the task of talking to the other muslim leaders much easier the official added. home minister l k advani was anxious that mumbai-based muslim lawyer yusuf muchala, who is cross-examining him for the liberhans commission, be involved in this dialogue. muchala was contacted and is known to have had several meetings with the kanchi shankaracharya.

"This story is from March 31, 2002  mumbai:the violence convulsing the land of the mahatma has deep roots in the past, social scientists and activists say. in addition, the economic downturn, the rapidly changing social fabric and the saffron brigadeaEUR(tm)s relentless preaching of its communal ideology have tinkered with the mindset of the average gujaratiaEUR""a person believed to be more comfortable doing business than brandishing swords, with a reputation for being tolerant and accommodating, experts say. the militancy by gujaratis is the result of the constant cultivation of communal ideas through literature and the educational system, says delhi-based sociologist d l sheth. ""history textbooks and gujarati literature focus on the humiliation faced by hindus at the hands of muslims, especially the ravaging of the somnath temple by mohammed ghaznavi, not once but 15 times,"" he says. ""the repressed aggression among gujarati hindus against the minorities has found voice with the bjp government power."" he says that the idea that gujaratis are peace-loving and tolerant was primarily formed by the dominance of the vegetarian jain and vaishnav communities in the state. ""but in the last 20 years, the composition cities has changed drastically with the steady arrival of migrants from other states,"" dr sheth says. ""the cities scarcely present gujarati culture or lifestyle any more."" writer and former mumbai sh e r i f f chandrakant bakshi says the gujarati psyche was fated to be transformed. ""the pendulum of history moves from one extreme another. there is no middle ground. the most submissive race or community metamorphoses into the most aggressive one,"" he claims. ""this is evident from the change in the jewish mindset, pre- and post-holocaust."" he believes that if a godhrastyle incident had occurred 50 years ago, gujarati hindus would been subdued. ""but the new post-independence generation... believes in quick retaliation, which is evident from the recent mayhem,"" he says. sociologist achyut yagnik marks the 1969 communal riots the turning point, as many secular gujaratis metamorphosed into religious chauvanists. ""civil society, literature and education the state systematically adopted a aEUR~us vs themaEUR(tm) discourse. the post-aEUR(tm)69 generation of gujaratis has been raised on this communal doctrine,"" he says. ""this is responsible for the perceptible drop in tolerance levels against the minorities. it was evident during the 1992-aEUR(tm)93 riots and the recent mayhem."" the post-godhra riots, mr yagnik notes, are more disturbing because of the intensified level of violence and barbarism. this is something no gujarati can explain or analyse since we are still trying to come out from the shock and revulsion,"" he says. ghanshyam shah, a professor at delhiaEUR(tm)s jawaharlal nehru univeristy, says his study of several communal riots in gujarat revealed a pattern: ""the communal riots were started by a handful of strategists and fanned agents who were skilled in using weapons and ransacking shops and houses."" he says that ordinary people were not involved previous riots and stayed passive aEUR""if somewhat insensitive observers. ""but what is disturbing this time is their witnessing and justifying the atrocities committed against the minorities,"" prof shah notes. ""for instance, the insistence that the minorities deserve what is happening to them."" the decline of the congress and the gradual saffronisation the state, with its accompanying propagation of the hindutva ideology, has also been responsible for the change in the gujarati psyche, social scientists say. ""gujarat has always been communal to a certain extent, partially because it shares a border with pakistan. since 1985, the saffron brigade has tried to exploit this communal feeling aEUR""the state witnessed the biggest mass mobilisation for the ram janmabhoomi movement and l k advani started his ayodhya rath yatra from somnath 1990,"" says mr yagnik, coauthor creating national movement: ram janmabhoomi and fear of the self. he believes the bjp government has institutionalised communal indoctrination through the educational system and the media. ""exploiting the godhra incident was the perfect technique to consolidate the hindu vote-bank,"" mr yagnik says. concurs human rights activist teesta setalvad,""itaEUR(tm)s a systematic and planned manipulation gujaratis by different agents, the vishwa hindu parishad, the rashtriya swayamseval sangh, the bharatiya janata part and the bajrang dal. they have tried hijack the gujarati culture and mindset and impose an extremely crude and macabre identity."" gujarati herself, she says gujaratis should break their silence and call the bluff of the saffron bridage, which claims represent all hindus. economic frustration also contributed to the rage. mr shah says 80 per cent of participants in the 1973 riots in the state whom interviewed told him that they were either unemployed or underpaid. ""with a significant rise in the casualisation of the working class over the last 30 years, lumpen elements available for violence have also increased,"" he says. concurs mr sheth, ""the decline of the (textile) mills in the 1980s and the high rate of urban unemployment have pushed people to vent their frustration through violence. they are also prone to communal twists vested parties."""	0	0	0	0	0

"new delhi: prime minister atal bihari vajpayee on saturday night dismissed vhp''s claim that acceptance of shila daan in ayodhya on friday was recognition in principle of construction of ram temple by the government in the disputed site and said that the shrine construction could begin only if the supreme court verdict favoured it. ""we have made our position very clear on the issue. the issue of temple construction is pending before the court. if the verdict goes in favour of the hindus, then temple construction will begin. otherwise not,"" he said while replying to a debate in lok sabha on his statement on ayodhya issue in the wake of the supreme court judgement. the prime minister said that if the verdict in the original title suit went in favour of muslims, then there was a provision to handle the matter. vajpayee clarified that he had not given any assurance to the vhp that temple construction would begin on a particular date in march. what he had assured them was that some way would be found out by march this year, but it could not materialise. he said that unless both sides adopted an approach of give and take and had a goodwill towards each other, it would be difficult to reach an agreement. vajpayee said that the shila was in the safe custody and it would be used only when the court verdict went in favour of the hindus, otherwise not. referring to the controversy over attorney general soli sorabjee''s submission before the apex court bench on march 13, vajpayee said what he said as a lawyer in the court was a matter of debate. there are different views on the 1994 judgement of the supreme court that ordered status quo. there could be an opportunity when a larger bench could take a different view. but till then the march 13 order would prevail and would be binding on all, the prime minister said. he refuted the charge that he had encouraged vhp and said that it was ""moving ahead because of popular support."" about the opposition criticism that his government was sitting ""like a tantrik on the skull of secularism"", vajpayee said, ""secularism will never die. the country was secular earlier and it will remain so. it is part of our tradition.it is a way of life."" but, he said, if secularism was surviving in this country, the credit should not not go to any single party but to the entire nation. cautioning political parties against practising selective secularism, he said that this would endanger the whole concept of secularism. expressing concern over the growing fundamentalism world over, the prime minister said if faith and belief did not remain within limits, it would assume monstrous proportions and would create anarchy. related stories:A gujarat, ayodhya crises handled well: pm A no crisis in nda over ayodhya: bjpA oppn slams pm for ''double-speak'' on ayodhya    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 23, 2002  surat: corruption is the use of public office for private gains and the resultant effect has now filtered down to the lowest social level affecting one and all to such an extent that there is an urgent need to address the factors responsible for promoting corruption in our country, which stands among one of the most corrupt nations in the world, according to international ngo transparency international. keeping this mind, the southern gujarat chamber of commerce and industry (sgcci) here on saturday has organised a meet, which will deliberate on the possible ways and means to reduce corruption in the society. the chief vigilance commissioner, n vittal, will give certain guidelines in this regard while delivering his keynote address on the occasion. sgcci has organised this meet in association with the surat citizens'' council trust (scct). scct chairman arun jariwala told tnn that lots of confusion prevails in the society about the sections responsible for using corrupt means for their own gains. often the business community becomes the convenient target, for conniving with the government authorities to serve their purpose in the form of tax evasion and getting the things done without meeting the statutory expenses, jariwala pointed. but, the same class also gets affected when they act as consumers in the society. hence, it would be grossly wrong to earmark a particular section for using unfair means for vested interests, he said. sgcci officials, too, pointed out that the way the democracy is practiced in the country, much space is created for corrupt practices without any check and balance for effective monitoring of the whole process. for example, the political funding is often the basis of origin of corruption, as by doling out money by an industrial house or group or even a small unit to the political parties, the tendency is to seek favours in terms of certain incentives or benefits, which would not be possible otherwise, a senior sgcci representative said on condition of anonymity. the roots of corruption are so deep that it would certainly be impossible to wipe it out at once. but, with attempts at every level, it can be reduced substantially, jariwala pointed. the unaccounted money in india is estimated to be in the range of rs 3,50,000 to 7,00,000 crore, more than the combined revenue of the centre and all the state governments in the last fiscal year, sources said quoting n vittal. corruption has not always been perceived to have a negative impact on economic development and growth, but it denigrates the performance of the system as a whole and compromises the economy''s long-term dynamic efficiency, sgcci officials explained on the basis of vittal''s observations.	0	0	0	0	0
"This story is from March 25, 2002  rajkot: the budget meeting of the district panchayat here turned violent with the elected members using microphones as weapons to throw at one another, pulling and tearing each other''s clothes and some even using the official files as missiles. in the resultant fistfight, congress leader gordhanbhai dhamelia lost his gold chain and bjp leader ghelabhai tilala''s shirt was torn into tatters. the meeting, held on friday evening, witnessed unprecedented rowdiness, which also saw the members stooping down to a new low and using filthy language to abuse one another. the chaos went on for almost an hour. due to the chaos, no discussion was possible on the budgetary proposals and the leader of the opposition tilala, deputy leader devshibhai dhadhani and nagdan chavda were suspended for their unruly behaviour. the chaos led to a situation where the acting president lalit kagadhara went on announcing the list of items and the members of the treasury benches went around shouting ""cleared"". as a result, all the items were passed without any discussion. the meeting began with the customary two-minute silence in memory of the late lok sabha speaker balyogi and those killed in the violence during the gujarat bandh, but no sooner did the question hour begin with the budget proposals all hell let loose and it was a free for all situation for the next 80 minutes. the turmoil began on a trifle matter like distributing the official agenda without the official signature of the president of the district panchayat and the district development officer. the bjp leaders demanded that they be supplied the certified copy of the agenda. this led to a heated exchange and eventually turned violent. the 23- member strong congress claimed after the meeting that the budget was passed, while the bjp with a strength of 10 members gave a written application claiming that the proposals were not passed as there was no discussion. however, the secretary maintained that as the majority of the members had passed the proposals, the budget was taken as passed."	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 29, 2002  bangalore: latur may be history. gujarat shocked us. afghanistan and japan jolted our memories anew on tuesday with an earthquake that killed 1,800 people. earthquakes rock us out of complacence but aftershocks seem to die down. while post-quake relief and deaths are matters put down on paper and forgotten, india is not doing much to prevent damage to life from non-seismic structures, says bangalore-based dr binod k. bhartia. ``in india, people are still busy discussing anti-seismic measures that have already been implemented in japan and the us 15 years ago.'''' bhartia studied, taught and worked in a land that''s been hit by the world''s most disastrous quakes. with a masters in civil engineering from tokyo university, he was a researcher in vibration-control design in a japanese company before teaching the subject at tokyo university from 1993 to 1995. bhartia''s research centred on anti-seismic devices like the tuned mass damper attached to building tops with springs. ``during a quake the damper moves, disseminating the vibrations and lessening the impact on the building.'''' in japan, attaching such devices to a building could add 10 per cent to cost of the building. in india, it would easily mean 50 per cent more than building cost because such instruments have to be imported, says bhartia. ``to manufacture such devices indigenously, you need volumes.'''' since the devices are expensive, there are not many takers. research is on currently in iits, structural research institute, chennai, and rourkee university. but manufacturers would rather invest in proven devices. another method of seismic resistance is base isolation where the building is attached to rollers at the base so that the whole structure sways from side to side during a quake and does not crumble down. japan has used this technology for the last 30 years, says bhartia. ``nearly 1,000 structures in japan are base-isolated. all newly constructed hospitals, school buildings are required to follow this method.'''' but in india, the committees that screen the design and plan of a building do not want to make this compulsory. the problem with buildings and structures in india is that they do not take into account horizontal forces in play, says bhartia. ``the recent japan quake measured 7 but there was no report of damage.''''	0	0	0	0	0

new delhi: bjp legislators on friday successfully blocked attempts by the opposition in the lok sabha to have a discussion on the narendra modi ministryaEUR(tm)s failure in handling the gujarat riots. the result was that the lok sabha was plunged into turmoil for almost an hour, with the bjp seeking to counter the oppositionaEUR(tm)s accusations by saying that it was the congress and the samajwadi party which were fuelling communal tension. bjp mps kirti azad and kirit somaiya led the attck on the opposition during zero hour and repeatedly interrupted the spaEUR(tm)s ramjilal suman, asking the chair about whether gujarat was the only issue in the country. it was finally left to former prime minister chandra shekhar to admonish them, saying he had for the first time in his 40 years of parliamentary life witnessed such an attempts by ruling party members to disrupt the proceedings. aEUR~aEUR~if the ruling party continues to try and throttle the opposition, then the house must be adjourned permanently,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he said, adding this would give a clear message to the people that the government was opposed to discussing vital issues. the former pm said no mp could question the authority of the chair and if this happened, the functioning of the house would come to a standstill. he said this after kirti azad challenged deputy speaker p m sayeed and asked him how he was allowing suman to raise gujarat and under what rule. sayeed repeatedly told azad that he was allowing mps who given notices to speak and said it was his discretion who should be given the floor first. chandra shekhar was effectively backed by congress deputy leader shivraj patil and chief whip priya ranjan dasmunshi who threatened the ruling coalition that their party would not cooperate with the government if the ruling party mps adopted such an attitude.

new delhi: the country's attorney-general pleading the vhp case in the supreme court made the bjp-led national democratic alliance look like a government of swayamsewaks. and the tv images of the pm's 'special envoy' accepting the carved pillars for the ram temple in ayodhya, gave the ceremony the official sanction the vishwa hindu parishad desired. indeed, ayodhya's return to centrestage over the last few weeks has presented the bjp's partners in the nda with their most serious ideological dilemma to date, given that all of them - barring the shiv sena - profess a commitment to secularism. on friday, it appeared as though the partners who had raised ''serious'' objections to the a-g's role, were willing to forgive the participation of a government representative in the shila daan ceremony. they all declared themselves satisfied since the court ruling banning any activity on the acquired land had been upheld, the administration had made enough arrests to prevent any concentration of karsewaks in ayodhya, and the day had passed off peacefully. but on saturday, after the vhp claimed that the acceptance of the shila by a government official indicated that its demand to start construction of the ram temple had been accepted, both the telugu desam party's yerran naidu and the tc's mamata bannerjee asked the pm on the floor of the lok sabha to clarify whether this claim was indeed true. clearly, the nda partners are torn: on the one hand, they are willing to overlook the bjp's lapses because the reasons that brought them together in 1998 hold true even now. in 1996, ideology kept them apart when the vajpayee government collapsed after 13 days; in 1998, they came together largely because of electoral compulsions, with the congress being the main rival for most of them in their own areas of influence. with the congress juggernaut marching steadily across the indian map, this is even more true today. on the other hand, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the allies to justify the position the bjp has been taking on the ayodhya issue to their own muslim constituency - they must, at least, appear to be keeping the bjp on its toes. so given this conflict between ideology and practical politics, what would be the breaking point for the bjp's allies? as samata party spokesperson shambhu srivastava put it, ''any violation of the supreme court order or failure to uphold the rule of law would have had serious implications and started off a chain reaction.'' or as yerran naidu phrased it,''if the bjp's intentions are followed by matching actions, then we would have had to review the situation.'' but though their patience has not run out, and the bjp has more to fear from the saffron brotherhood than from its allies, the recent assembly elections, combined with the events in ayodhya, have triggered off a qualitative difference in the relationship: the bjp's abysmal performance has made it look increasingly like a loser. as trinamul congress sources said, ''we would like to be back in the government, but the question is: are we boarding a sinking ship?'' and this concern has sparked off some behind-the-scenes activity: the recent ayodhya crisis saw the jd-u, the tc, the national conference, the dravida munnetra kazhagham and the indian national lok dal all getting in touch with andhra pradesh chief minister n chandrababu naidu; a meeting is likely after the assembly session concludes in hyderabad.

This story is from March 22, 2002  lucknow: yet another seer has offered a out-of-court formula to solve the ayodhya dispute. seer of goverdhan math swami nischalanand sarsawati dev, who is on a two-day visit to the state capital, said on thursday that aEURoethe dispute cannot be resolved in the court of law and a strong political will is required to solve the ayodhya impasse.aEUR the seer feared that the court verdict might lead to a civil war-like situation in the country. aEURoeso, it was the duty of the government and all political parties to come forward and find an amicable solution to the temple issue,aEUR he added. aEURoethe court cannot do the balancing act. if the verdict goes for the construction of mosque or vice versa, it may lead to a civil war-like situation. to avoid such a situation, the government must show political will to resolve the dispute out of court.aEUR aEURoewhen sardar vallabh bhai patel could use his acumen to facilitate renovation of somnath temple, then it is the duty of the government and all other political parties to pave the way for the temple construction,aEUR he said. aEURoepolicy, power and mutual understanding are key weapons with the government with which it can solve the dispute in consultation with the other political parties.aEUR the seer claimed that his formula, which he had once offered to the then rao government was still relevant and the only way to solve the ayodhya imbroglio. aEURoethe congress should bring a resolution for construction of ram temple in ayodhya on the 67.7 acre land and the bjp, its allies and all opposition parties should support it after taking leaders of the minority community into confidence to put an end to the dispute once and for all.aEUR he claimed that the then bjp president and now union home minister lk adavni had agreed to support the formula, but the rao government did not agree to it. swami nischalanand claimed all prominent seers were in touch with one another to find a solution to the ayodhya dispute. aEURoewe would offer valuable advice if asked by the government,aEUR he stated.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 30, 2002  anandpur sahib: the hola mohalla eve here witnessed a riot of colours, mostly black, that political parties splashed on one another even as thousands of devotees visiting the historical gurdwara watched it happen with gay abandon. in a veritable show of strength the congress exhibited its political prowess in a manner that reduced the shiromani akali dal to a seemingly marginal player with the tohra and the mann factions of the akali dal also pitching in their tents. harping on his by-now-favourite topic of corruption during the sad-bjp rule, chief minister amarinder singh said the government would soon recommend appropriate action against punjab public service commission chairman ravi inder paul sidhu to ensure that he was removed from the office after having allegedly found receiving a bribe of rs 5 lakh. even as sidhu has been behind the bars, the government, after seeking legal opinion, proposed to make interim arrangements to ensure smooth running of the ppsc. the chief minister said for the last six months he had been crying hoarse that the ppsc was reeking with corruption. but the then chief minister prakash singh badal turned deaf ear to it, giving indications as if he was in nexus with the chairman. how else badal allowed rampant corruption to prevail in the ppsc? amarinder asked. he said his government was determined to combat corruption without, however, indulging in witchhunting and vendetta. the chief minister reiterated his unstinted support to all ssps to root out corruption. in spite of severe econimic crisis that had gripped the state, his government was committed to development, he added. the chief minister announced that all border villages would start receiving round-the-clock electricity supply. he said a rs 176-crore package had been prepared for the development works in border villages even as farmers whose land was taken over by the defence personnel recently, would be given adequate compensation. amarinder said he had held consultations with the defence minister george fernandes on this issue. the shiromani akali dal conference was conspicuous by the absence of badal. even as the attendance at the sad conference was a telling sign of the party presently got out of power, senior leaders like sukhdev singh dhindsa, capt kanwaljit singh, jagir kaur and sgpc president kirpal singh badungar remained undeterred and held the fort. the conference took exception to the congress governmentaEUR(tm)s alleged policy of giving secondary treatment to punjabi language during the recent vidhan sabha session, and also warned against disconnecting 24-hour power supply to this holy city. the conference proposed two resolutions on the count and threatened to launch agitations if the government did not revise its policy on these issues. speaking at the conference, former sgpc president gurcharan singh tohra spared the congress but chose to focus his attack on the centre and the badal faction. he expressed concern over the recent riots in gujarat and the resolution adopted by the rss and said that the centre was deliberately creating insecurity among minorities. the dal khalsa, the aissf (gill) and the aiyad joined tohra in his protest.they announced to present memorandum to the governor in chandigarh on april 5 against the promulgation of the pota.	0	0	0	0	0

"ahmedabad: those talking about normalcy returning to gujarat perhaps have in mind the crowds that throng the state''s first mcdonald''s outlet here since it opened last thursday. in these five days, about 30,000 visited the restaurant aEUR"" an unbelievable response in these troubled times. but big mac''s success is giving a false sense of normalcy in a city that has lost 300 lives so far. in fact, a full one month after the february 27 godhra attack, gujarat is still feeling the heat from the burnt down s-6 compartment of sabarmati express. the first week of frenzy had just died down when the march 15 ram shila pujan fuelled a fresh bout of violence which has so far taken 30 more lives. with holi''s potential for mischief later this week, none of the nearly 100,000 refugees at the relief camps is willing to go back to their homes. most of them actually have no homes to go back to, and even if they do, the feeling of fear is so overwhelming that they are willing to live in the filthy camps rather than risk attacks. just consider the statistics of the month-long nightmare. the official death toll stands at 783. nearly 97,998 people are living in 101 relief camps. the government has declared different packages, including that of providing rs 5,000 to rs 50,000 as compensation to those whose houses have been gutted, but the claimants don''t know where to build their houses. police say 125 persons have died in police firing. they fired 6,500 rounds, lobbed 8,300 teargas shells and arrested a staggering 10,000 people. impressive figures, but nobody is impressed. not the all-party mps'' delegation or the national commission for minorities or even the national human rights commission. the impact of violence is written around not only the relief camps but also the nearly 30 towns and cities of gujarat which are still under curfew as the police, facing the music for their initial sluggishness, are not taking any chances in the build-up to holi. the carnages of the first three days, or 72 hours as chief minister narendra modi likes to put it, have given way to a low-intensity but sustained warfare where students going to examination halls have been stabbed, nurses going to hospital for the night-shift have been attacked with acid bombs, individuals having married outside the community have been hunted down and killed and people being escorted to safety by the police have been lynched. ask modi when all this would end and he finds a rather strange synchronisation between the mps and the mobs when he says that the violence would come to an end when the lok sabha session ends. the human toll and the shattered psyche apart, it is the financial punch of the riots that is beginning to tell. cii and gcci estimates of losses in this one month are rs 2,000 crore, something that a state already reeling under the impact of the earthquake just could not afford. the earthquake at least brought people together.... related storiesA violence continues, vajpayee summons modiA even nurses not being spared by rioters A non-gujarati muslim officers await an exit    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	1	1	1	0	1

This story is from March 26, 2002  mumbai: arif manwa, who has been planting bt cotton for about two years, is looking at a farm ravaged by pests. his tragedy is echoed by several of his neighbours, all of them small cotton farmers who had planted the `wonder seeds'' of bt cotton.  these genetically modified (gm) seeds were expected to kill the dreaded bollworm, but arif''s farm reveals that the pests in his area have become resistant to the bt toxin. obviously, something has gone wrong with the bt experiment.  although arif''s story is unfolding in sulawesi, indonesia, it holds greatA salience for india. india''s genetic engineering approval committee (geac) is meeting today to decide whether commercial cultivation of bt-cotton should be allowed in the country.  many farmers and agrobiotech companies eagerly await what is by most accounts going to be a heads up to bt-cotton cultivators. however, many environmentalists and scientists fear that legalising bt-cotton cultivation could herald a new environmental and economic quandary for the country.  scientists explain that the pest-resistant trait of bt-cotton is unlikely to hold up in india because the country''s agricultural conditions are dramatically different from conditions in north america, where bt-cotton was originally developed. they say that to gauge the stark contrast between indian and american conditions, one should consider the instructions issued by the united states environment protection agency for bt-cotton cultivation. ``at least five acres of non-bt cotton should be planted for every 95 acres of bt-cotton. the size of this five-acre `refuge'' (which is a buffer zone where bollworms can feed) should be at least 150 feet wide.''''  ``leave aside refuges, even many of our fields are not 150 feet wide. our tiny land holdings are separated not by five acres of buffer zones but more often by small gutters. given the indian cheek-by-jowl agricultural conditions and the country''s heavy pest load, a rapid breakdown of resistance __ as seen in indonesia __ is inevitable,'''' says suman sahai, founder of gene campaign, a non-governmental environmental movement.  the breakdown of bt-cotton''s pest resistance will mean that farmers will have to start using pesticides again. this has already begun in australia, where the transgenic and insect management strategy committee of the australian cotton growers research association has advised its farmers to spray additional insecticide since ``the bt is failing to control the target pest it was introduced for''''.  more importantly, a widely used, ecofriendly pesticide __ the bt bacteria __will no more be available for use on cotton or on other crops.  monsanto, the multinational company which developed bt-cotton, has countered that to deal with the resistance problem, it is now working on a cotton plant which will have two toxin-producing genes. currently, bt-cotton has one toxin-producing gene from a soil-borne bacterium, bacillus thuringiensis.  environmentalists wryly respond that this strategy of producing gm plants with an increasing number of toxin-producing genes is similar to the past ruinous strategy which forced farmers to use more and more toxic pesticides. ``when fourth generation pesticides were introduced in india, there was great excitement __ not unlike the excitement welcoming bt-cotton. for the first two-three years, the pesticides killed everything, including bollworms. butA soon, insects developed resistance, leading to even more poisonous sprays, and then failed harvests and mounting debts for farmers,'''' recounts a senior official in the ministry of environment and forests, who wished to remain anonymous. by some accounts, a very large number of cotton farmers across the country have committed suicide in the last two decades. their debts and despair have been triggered at least partly by the vicious chemical cycleA which backfired on them.  will the seeming reprieve offered by bt-cotton end up as similarlyA short-lived manna? vandana shiva, a leading environmentalist, admits that this is a very real danger, especially since gm crops are being brought into india at a time when the vast majority __ farmers, journalists, government, and scientists __ have not studied the implications of gm technology. ``india''s biosafety ignorance makes it gullible to corporate propaganda, and doesn''t allow us to act on our rights and responsibilities,'''' she says.  ironically, the farmers who have been badly hit by the chemical trap of pesticides are the ones most loudly clamouring for bt-cotton. they are joined by politicians, be it the chief minister of punjab or the agriculture minister of gujarat, economists, and members of the media in criticising the regulatory body, the geac in the ministry of environment and forests, for insisting on field trials to ascertain the suitability of bt-cotton in indian conditions.  these critics bemoan that india''s agricultural productivity and globalA competitiveness are being held back. they point to china and how its bt-cotton is racing ahead in export markets without any apparent environmental or social costs.  ms shiva deflates the myth of china''s bt-cotton success by pointing out that the country is exporting more cotton because previously closed markets are liberalising, and not because of bt technology. ``commentators are confusing the consequences of trade with technology,'''' she says.  moreover, little biosafety or environmental data has emerged from china, adds ms sahai. according to her, the absence of data does not mean that there has been no environmental damage, but that there are no regulatory and monitoring processes in place. ``there are many environmental catastrophes in china, but the data might never be collected and will definitely not be allowed to leave the country easily,'''' she says. ``after all, china is not only the country of export successes but also of the cultural revolution and the great leap forward in which several millions of people were killed and the world didn''t know about this until decades later.''''  experts further assert that china is arguably the worst political template for india. ``political and technological questioning is not easily allowed there, especially if these go against policies of the party high command. expecting india to adhere to a similarly non-transparent dictatorial system is not only foolhardy, it is dangerous for our people,'''' asserts the bureaucrat from theA ministry of environment and forests.  ``in no democratic country have gm crops been introduced in a hurry. only countries like china have hurriedly heralded them in,'''' affirms ms shiva. in this context, it is worth noting that the united states took about a decade before allowing large-scale gm cultivation. some countries in europe have outright banned gm crops. in other countries such as britain, where there isA no commercial gm cultivation, gm food has been one of the most contentious topics of public debate in the last decade.  as the debate in india on the pros and cons of gm crops builds up, few are calling for an outright ban on all gm crops and gm research. even critics of bt-cotton acknowledge that there are significant advantages to be reaped from this new technology __ be it in developing drought-resistant grains or higher yield pulses. ``it is more a question of whether we are going to be strong-armed into using gm crops in a hurry through a combination of aggressive multinational promotion and domestic gullibility and corruption, or whether we will adopt this technology selectively, under proper regulation, at our own pace, and on our own terms,'''' sums up ms sahai.	0	0	0	0	0

A A hindi    the shila for the proposed ram temple was handed over to shatrughan singh, in-charge of the ayodhya cell in the cabinet secretariat, in the courtyard of the akhara, seat of paramahans, after a brief puja at 3.30 pm, one hour 15 minutes behind schedule. faizabad divisional commissioner anil kumar gupta, who is also the receiver of the acquired land, was not present when the shila daan was done. originally, he was to receive it. the akhara is half-a-km away from ramkot mohalla, the spot where the plan was to originally make the shila daan and more than a km away from the acquired land near the disputed site. officials are understood to have convinced paramhans and vhp leader ashok singhal that their plans for making the shila daan further away at ramkot mohalla outside the acuqired land could create problems. senior police officials said they had to stop the procession at the akhara as they felt the crowds at ramkot mohalla could swell and the situation become unmanageable. navneet seghal, former faizabad district magistrate, conducted hectic negotitations before finally persuading paramhans to agree to conducting the ceremony at his akhara itself. bjp mp from faizabad and bajrang dal leader vinay katiyar was also present at the shila daan. however, paramhans himself looked agitated at the turn of events and refused to talk to reporters after the ceremony. the second shila for the proposed ram temple was also donated by ramchandra das paramhans to a senior government official. according to unconfirmed reports, the state administration will allow batches of 25 people each to pay homage at the ram lalla temple. ashok singhal and the ramjanambhoomi president mahant ramchandra das paramhans began the procession at about 2 pm from karsevakpuram. they were among the 50-strong contingent taking the shila for donation to the government receiver. a crowd of about 1,000 people was accompanying the sants. the shila was taken to its destination on a cycle-cart amid chanting of shlokas and mantras. a vhp functionary said from ayodhya that the procession left karsevakpuram around 2 pm and reached hanumangarhi at 2.35 pm. shatrughan singh, an ias of the uttaranchal cadre and a former divisional commissioner of faizabad, is attached to the ayodhya cell of the prime minister''s office. his presence as the observer is being seen as the prime minister''s direct involvement with the shila daan ceremony. meanwhile, the rest of ayodhya wore a deserted look. according to unconfirmed but reliable sources the paramhans along with a group of 25 sadhus would be allowed to walk up to the vvip gate of ram janmabhoomi to donate the shila. bjp mp vinay katiyar said the shila would be donated on the way to the make-shift ram temple at the disputed site here. katiyar had a 30-minute closed-door meeting with paramhans and vhp international working president ashok singhal at the vhp workshop here. after donating the shila, the group will head for the makeshift temple and offer prayers there. there was unprecendented security in the temple town and even mediapersons had difficulty entering the city. two contingents of ram sevaks numbering 100-150, from karnataka and andhra pradesh, who tried to sneak into the town through a byroad were chased away by the security forces and arrested. all shops in the city were closed and there was no build up of kar sevaks to be seen. security personnel have virtually sealed off the vhp campuses in karsevakpuram and ramsevakpuram as also the outfit''s workshop where its leaders, including international working president ashok singhal and ram janmabhoomi nyas president mahant parmhans ramachandra das are staying. related stories A ram janmabhoomi complex sealedA govt clamps down on vhp activistsA full coverageA march 15 in history    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail	0	1	1	0	0

"This story is from March 20, 2002  lucknow: who will foot the bill if the high court appoints a commission for expeditious hearing of ayodhya cases? though up government has given its consent to the three-judge bench that it would abide by the court directive, on its own, the state may not be able to bear the expenses with its coffers all empty. a piquant situation arose when the bench asked the state government whether or not it was ready to bear the burden if a commission was set up. during lunch hour, additional solicitor general r n trivedi called up senior up officials in this connection. initially the state governmentaEUR(tm)s response was negative, it is understood. later, instructions were passed on to the state law department to file a written reply that the state government would bear the cost. the reply was submitted by additional advocate general ramesh kumar singh . keeping the stateaEUR(tm)s finacial constraints in mind, it is learnt, an understanding was reached with the centre that if the state government failed to bear the burden, the centre would chip in. the court had already appointed three commissions in the past for recording evidence of witnesses. the first one was that of additional district judge, faizabad, who had recorded evidence of ram janambhoomi nyas chairman mahant ramchandra das paramhans. the second was headed by narendra srivastava, osd allahabad high court while the third one was that of additional district judge, noida ,which was appointed to record statement of dr s p gupta, a witness. for each witness, there would be a separate one-man commission (called commissioner). the commissionaEUR(tm)s economics, however, makes a big hole in stateaEUR(tm)s pocket. a huge sum is spent on ta/da/staff/vehicle/accommodation/fare and other paraphernalia of the commission. the state also bears expenses incurred on counsels who accompany the commission to cross-examine the witness. the expenses increase manifold as it takes about 10 to 15 days to record evidence. so far, evidence of only one witness has been recorded by the commission from hindu side (mahant das) while evidence of two otheraEUR"" devki nandan and dr s p guptaaEUR"" are being recorded. from muslim side, 24 witnesses have so far appeared and cross-examination of 25th is on. about 25 witnesses from hindu side and 4 or 5 from muslim side are yet to appear before the ayodhya court (or commission if appointed). the expenses on separate commission for each witness may prove to be a big drain on the state exchequer."	0	0	0	0	0

"ahmedabad: the change of programme from bhoomi pujan to shila daan at ayodhya was ""no compromise or climb down"" as regard to ram temple movement, gujarat rss said here monday and maintained that the sangh parivar had enough confidence in the leadership of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee. ""there was no compromise; the temple construction movement inched a step ahead instead, despite such an impression being created,"" gujarat rss spokesman pradip jain said. he said the change from bhoomi pujan to shila daan did not mean any dilution in the movement. ""in fact, there is hardly any difference between the two. after all, by accepting the carved stone, the government of india has taken upon itself the issue of temple construction,"" he said. jain dismissed contentions that the right wing hindu forces have lost faith in the leadership of vajpayee saying ""as far as bjp''s compulsion is concerned, we understand the difference between a political outfit and the stand of the government."" he also denied that there was any talk about ""need for a more hardline bjp leadership"" for the success of the temple movement and also for realising other hindutva goals.

"This story is from March 21, 2002  ahmedabad: supercop julio ribeiro has been livid of late. as someone who was shifted from mumbai to ahmedabad as police commissioner at the request of the gujarat government to quell the 1985 riots, he says he is ashamed at the way the police have conducted themselves during the recent violence that wracked the state. ""policemen have become eunuchs today,"" he proclaims. speaking to tnn from mumbai, ribeiro said policemen have only themselves to blame for ""turning eunuchs"". ""what the police force needs today are leaders who can lead from the front and show that they mean business; what we have today are officers who lobby with politicians to get themselves posted as commissioners and director-generals and they have to pay back the politicians for these favours,"" he said. ribeiro says in moments of crisis, the entire police force looks at its leaders for directions. ""if at that moment, the police force thinks their boss is looking to the mantralaya for directions, you have had it."" in the ''85 riots, when ribeiro was called in after the local police failed to contain the riots for weeks together, ribeiro arrested five congress leaders under the national security act despite the fact that gujarat then was a congress-ruled state. ""almost immediately, everybody could see that i meant business and the entire force could sense that i was in charge of the situation,"" he recalls. no officer under him, he said, dared not to carry out his duties because each one of them was accountable only to the law, not to the political party in power. ribeiro says he finds the excuse given by the police in gujarat, that they were unable to check the riots because they were outnumbered by the mobs, rather specious. ""five armed policemen are enough to control a mob of 5,000, but the policemen should show, through their body language, that they are determined; if they take position and train their guns at the people, the mobs can easily sense trouble and back off."" besides, he says, even if the police were outnumbered , it was their job to fire at the mobs. ""if policemen die in the process, well that''s it, that is what they are trained for, it is their job."" he adds that he does not believe the remark of a senior ahmedabad police official that the policemen were part of society and could not remain isolated from all its influences. ""this is nonsense, what are policemen trained for then...they are trained to maintain law and order at all costs and remain free and fair under all circumstances; when they wear a uniform, they should be loyal to only the uniform, nothing else."" if there are any doubts on this count, he says, the police force should look to the army and take inspiration from it. ribeiro said the riots in gujarat, beginning with the godhra incident, had a ""frightening ring to them"". the frightening aspect was that there was a veneer of nationalism being given to it. ""this is not patriotism or nationalism; all that you are doing is to weaken the fabric of the nation and that can be very dangerous."". the problem, as he sees it, cannot be solved only through policing methods. it is in this connection that he has launched projects in the slums of mumbai to bring communities together and make them understand that the leaders who instigate them never get caught. it is only the innocent who suffer and get killed. wanted: another ribeiro! gujarat congress president amarsinh choudhary was the chief minister in ''85 when he recommended to the centre that they send a senior and independent officer to contain the riots in ahmedabad. in came ribeiro and the riots abated in a couple of days. choudhary says ribeiro was effective because he was ""fiercely independent and nobody could influence him"". what we need today is another ribeiro, says choudhary, because the police force is dancing to the tunes of the ruling bjp and badly let the people down.

"shimla: prime minister atal bihari vajpayee on monday allayed fears that the current indo-pak tension could trigger a nuclear conflict but asserted that the country was prepared for any eventuality. he also ruled out immediate withdrawal of troops from the border. ""there is no possibility or threat of a nuclear war. india had already declared that it would not be the first to use nuclear weapons and pakistan has also expressed similar views. i do not see any threat of a nuclear war"", prime minister, who is here on a two-day visit, said. on withdrawl of troops from the border, vajpayee said ""there is no such proposal at present"" and recalled that the decision to deploy forces was taken by a high level committee which included representatives from the three services. about resumption of the stalled dialogue with pakistan, the prime minister said, ""we will talk only when a conducive atmosphere is created. everyday violence and clashes are taking place. jawans are being killed and civilians are being targeted"". the prime minister also made it clear that availability of funds would not come in the way of defence purchases. he, however, said that sometimes such purchases took time in view of difficult negotiations involved. when asked whether the government would seek any amendment to the constitution to find a solution to the vexed ayodhya issue in the wake of such a demand by the vhp, vajpayee said ""there is no need for a change in the constitution. the constitution will not be changed for this matter"". on the criticism of gujarat chief minister narendra modi by the national human rights commission on the handling of riots in the state following the godhra carnage, he said that the government was awaiting nhrc''s ""full and final"" report.

"new delhi: the nda allies meet ended here on friday evening with the prime minister assuring them that the government would stick to the nda agenda. with this, the prime minister has probably silenced the dissenters among the allies on the ayodhya and vhp issues. all nda allies assured their support to the government on poto at the joint session of parliament on march 26. some leaders emerging from the meeting said that at the very outset of the meeting, home minister l k advani said that there was no plan of the vhp to take out the asthi kalash yatra and it was totally a misconception. he also said that there would be no deviaton from the agreed common minimum programme of the nda. advani also allayed fears of some of the allies that poto might be misused and said that any such misuse would be looked into individually. coming out of the nda meeting trinamul congress chief mamata banerjee said that her party had proposed better floor co-ordination in parliament among the allies and asked the government to stick to the common minimum programme. earlier in the day, nda allies who met here informally on friday afternoon have decided to ask the pm that the government should not go beyond the common minimum programme of the alliance. the afternoon meeting was attended by yeren naidu (tdp), mamata banerjee (trinamul), raghunath singh (samata pary), sushil kumar (inld) and d p yadav (jdu) among others. the allies will demand that the government takes steps to maintain peace and communal harmony in view of holi and muharram festivals. the allies also strongly condemned thursday''s incident involving d p yadav and vinay katiyar outside parliament house. the allies had earlier decided to meet formally on friday noon but decided to meet informally after the pm called the nda meet in the evening. ""even tough we are not memers of the nda, we have suggested to the other allies that they should wait till the pmaEUR(tm)s meeting in the evening,"" said naidu. they allies even went to the extent of threatening that if the vhpaEUR(tm)s planned asthi kalash yatra was allowed to take place they will be compelled to withdraw their support to the government. raghunath jha of the samata party had said if the government gave permission to vhp for this yatra, the country would burn and his party would be left with no other option but to withdraw support. other allies like the trinamul congress and janata dal united had also echoed similar sentiments. on thursday, trouble began when bjp mps vinay katiyar and mahant avaidya nath refused to allow jdu member devendra prasad yadav and indian national lok dal member sushil kumar indora from speaking in the lok sabha. both parties are allies of the government and both the mps wanted to protest against the vhp''s activities. after the lok sabha was adjourned, katiyar and devendra prasad yadav almost came to blows but were pacified by union minister pramod mahajan. related stories:A president summons joint session on mar 26A trinamul not to attend joint session on potoA joint session a wrong precedent: congress    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 16, 2002  kolkata: the culprits involved in the attack on the train at godhra in gujarat did not cross over to bangladesh through indo-bangla border in west bengal, chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee told the state assembly on thursday. bhattacharjee made the statement to a supplementary raised by the leader of the opposition pankaj banerjee, who belongs to the trinamool congress. the chief minister, however, admitted that the indo-bangla border was being used by terrorist outfits and smugglers and this was nothing new. it was not possible for the state government alone to prevent north bengal being used by the insurgents as free corridor until and unless the borders were being protected properly by the bsf personnel, he said. the chief minister also said that a total of 30 persons have been arrested over the past two years in the state on charges of being operating as isi agents. the information, in reply to a question by cpi legislator purnendu sengupta, was to have been orally given to the assembly during question hour on thursday. however, the question did not come up for discussion due to lack of time. bhattacharjee in his reply stated that anti-terrorist cells were operating at the state intelligence bureau as well as the state criminal investigation department. border vigil has been strengthened. hotels, guest houses and vital installations are being closely watched, the chief minister said. earlier, replying to a question by trinamul congress mla jyotipriya mullick, the chief minister said that the state government was creating new police stations in the border areas to tackle the problem of terrorist elements infiltrating into india through the porous borders. new police outposts have recently been created at purnea crossing under karandighi police station of north dinajpur and at bulbulchandi under habibpur police station of malda district. new stations have been opened and are more being planned in darjeeling, siliguri jalpaiguri and cooch behar. however, we cannot open more than seven or eight police stations a year due to financial constraints, bhattacharjee said. most of the new police stations that have come up in recent years are in the border areas. guarding the borders is essentially the responsibility of the centre. however, only 20 battalions of the border security force as against the sanctioned strength of 34 battalions are stationed here, which leaves a vast area unguarded, the chief minister said. the union home ministry has been requested to give more central forces. i have personally talked to lk advani twice over the issue, he said. the main issue over guarding the borders is creation of border roads and fencing. we have completed around 70 per cent of the border roads. but fencing is far from complete, the chief minister said.

new delhi: prime minister atal bihari vajpayee said on monday that vishwa hindu parishad leader ashok singhal would be taken into protective custody if he persists with his fast over the ayodhya issue. winding up the discussion in the rajya sabha on the `motion of thanks' to the president's address, vajpayee said if it became ncessary, the step would be taken in order to protect the vhp leader's health. stating that the situation in ayodhya was normal and peaceful, and that life was back on the rails, the pm said there was no reason for singhal to go on strike for what was yet to be done. taking a pot shot at the vhp leader, vajpayee said singhal had perhaps thought that if he sat on a hunger strike, the mps would continue to raise the ayodhya issue in parliament. whatever was to be said on ayodhya had been said, added vajpayee. the town was fast returning towards normalcy. the trade had begun and schools had reopened. the centre, under whose rule the state is presently, was fully aware of its duties and what needed to be done, pointed out the pm. singhal began an indefinite hunger-strike at karsevakpuram in ayodhya on sunday to press his demand for providing security to kar sevaks visiting ayodhya to participate in the purnahuti yagya and ensure their safe return. ''the hunger-strike will continue till the centre gives a guarantee that kar sevaks coming to ayodhya to take part in the yagya would be provided security and their safe return ensured,'' singhal said. he had also asked the state government to restore normal working conditions in ayodhya.

""the shilas have an important place in the hindu society and they should be worshipped. they were meant to be used in the temple construction and the government officials have no business to keep them,"" he said. he charged the nyas with ""deviating from its objectives"" and asked its members to make it clear whether they felt the government would construct the temple.

"This story is from March 16, 2002  ahmedabad: the time was 2.15 pm and the traffic signals at the bata square on ashram road were on the blink. a large group of boisterous youngsters with saffron bandannas climbed on each others'' shoulders and danced to chants of shri ram jai ram... with clanging bells for accompaniment at the someshwar mahadeo temple. as ram dhun rang out along with loud bangs of crackers from different corners of ahmedabad, the city downed shutters and people scooted back home as quickly as they could. the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) got unprecedented response from the people of ahmedabad after the shila daan ceremony at ayodhya by ramchandra paramhans. the jai ram shri ram chanting was perhaps the loudest at the vhp headquarters. at 2:15 pm sharp, veteran vhp leader keka shastri offered a platter of lights to an idol of lord ram amid heavy beating of traditional drums and gongs. the aarti lasted about 20 minutes with devotees thronging the temple at the headquarters. the venue attracted employees of offices from the surrounding areas and also housewives with their children. unusually absent were the vhp tilakdharis. ""they have reached ayodhya,"" said jaydeep patel, the vhp joint general secretary. speaking to reporters just after the prayer, shastri said, ""by the grace of lord ram, the construction of mandir will definitely be completed."" at shahibaug, kalupur and raikhad areas, clanging of bells and ram dhun yatras marked march 15 with sporadic incidents of violence and arson. even the normally bustling shops at relief road lay dead as groups of anxious people lined the thoroughfare waiting for the worst to happen. ""no, there hasn''t been any violence in this area"", said mohammad akhtar, a local shopkeeper, adding: ""i hope this tension dies down and we can get back to business"". with traffic down to a trickle, driving on the city''s normally busy roads proved easier, but the tension was palpable amongst bystanders and those who waited desperately for the town bus to arrive for going home. but soon they had to look towards autorickshaws as the ahmedabad municipal transport services (amts) stopped its services at around 3 pm. the shahibaug area, home to the ahmedabad police headquarters, was anything but silent with loud cracker bursts and ram dhun chants. across the street alongside the commissioner''s office is narmadeshwar mahadeo temple where religious rites were at full swing when tnn reached. in sharp contrast to ''noisy'' march 15 celebrations at swaminarayan chowk was the imposing yet half-burnt mv house, a grim reminder of the severity of the recent riots. empty streets gave way to thoroughfare carpeted with spent fireworks. raipur darwaja was no less tense. armymen and police officials joined hands to drive back a large number of local residents, who despite being in a sensitive area insisted on bursting crackers and setting off anars. though shops, commercial establishments and even houses remained closed, people wandered around, gossiping and sipping tea in groups in the raipur and khadia area. just outside raipur darwaja, the situation continued to be tense till late in the afternoon. fireworks and boisterous celebrations were stopped by an army-police combine while a large group of minority community members looked on from rooftops and verandas. joharbhai m rupawala, who along with a few other members of the minority community had ventured out of home, said: ""other than the loud fireworks across the street, we are relatively safe."" further on, the situation returned to deserted streets highlighted by empty ahmedabad municipal corporation premises. passers-by were received with suspicious looks from localites perched on rooftops, balconies and policemen huddled in groups along the forsaken roads. there was a palpable tension in the air everywhere. some even asked the police for permission to burst crackers like the young man at idgah road. ""just allow me to burst this cracker series,"" he pleaded with a policeman.  "	0	0	1	0	0
This story is from March 30, 2002  bangalore: downcast. that''s india today. it can''t be otherwise in a nation in chaos. one that''s heaving under the shame of scant regard for human life and the complete absence of a conscience that pricks. there''s gujarat that''s reached saturation point, but the bloodletting won''t stop. there are death dances in elite society that make a mockery of life. pushed over the edge all right, but suicide or bumped off, no one will ever know, and conveniently so. there''s bad politics, more lethal and incriminating than bad blood. and then there''s religion, that bastion of the faithful and the seekers, now the biggest letdown. but in the prevailing gloom, the mood is upbeat in one camp: the children''s camp. it is summer vacations time and there is collective rejoicing as they put behind them the sweat, toil and exam fever of another academic session, and step into that time of the year when they cool off and recharge batteries their way. by doing things they like doing best, in the way they enjoy doing them most and at a pace they set for themselves. less intrusions, less restrictions and no overbearing regimen. they are free ... to dream, fantasise, journey into a make-believe world ... the world of their dreams. a child''s style of philosophising on life. vacation time is again a time of extra-curriculars. when parents pack in as many holiday camps and alternative learning experiences for children, in the hope that it will help their wards develop into well-rounded, well-heeled human beings with a weltanschaung (world view) that will broaden their horizons and take them places. parents may admit to killing two birds in the process. keeping the children out of mischief and as much out of their hair, even as the juniors are being groomed in an assortment of alternative skills at the camps and workshops. there are camps and camps for children. new, ingenious additions with every passing year, offering the best in creativity and knowledge-base. or so they claim. a seasonal industry that''s turned into a veritable cash cow that businessmen eye hard and milk dry with their eyes solely on the registers. but why isn''t anybody talking about a camp on sensitising children? on instilling in them the quality of sensitivity, so precious, but so rare in today''s world. it is the one quality, that essential perquisite in character-building that will breathe new life into a maimed and tainted world. the one quality, perhaps the only one that can usher in the new world order. so this vacations, spare a thought to the sensitivity quotient in your children. character-building begins at home. camps and schools can only aid the process. waste no time. make the difference, right at home. let this be a holiday the family will cherish the rest of their lives. meerajohn@indiatimes.com  	0	0	0	0	0

""after all, the examiners checking the papers written on march 18 onwards would know that they were not examining answersheets of those centres where the examinations were postponed. a bias is likely to set in. i would request education minister anandiben patel to work out a mechanism whereby the students and parents don''t feel that they have become victims of such discrimination,"" amin said. ""the exams are being held only to prove it to the world that the law and order situation in gujarat is normal,"" he added. puzzled by an opposition walk-out from the state assembly just before she stood up to reply to the debate on education, anandiben refused to make any such assurance to the house. she said, ""i wanted to reply to what amin had said. however, with the opposition not around, i do not wish to make a statement."" the opposition walked out protesting against the alleged breach of privilege of the house by her for giving an interview to a daily on her budgetary demands one day before they were placed in the assembly. amin said despite the state government''s tall claims, today as many as 32,000 primary schoolrooms remain to be constructed in gujarat. as a result, lakhs of students have to study in the open. this apart, exactly 17,332 primary schoolteachers'' vacancies remain to be filled up. demanding that the local bodies be given cent per cent grant instead of 80 per cent to look into primary education, he said, this would further help decrease the dropout rate, already down to 42 per cent from 51 per cent in five years. criticising the state government for approving self-finance colleges for arts, college and science graduates, amin said, ""one can understand the self-finance norm for technical education. but for graduate courses, which do not ensure any employment, charging rs 30,000 for three years is too much of a burden for poor parents. instead of allowing self-finance colleges in such deprived areas like bapunagar and sardarnagar in ahmedabad, grant-in-aid colleges should have been approved."" criticising the state government for its intention to come up with a so-called common universities act, amin said, ""this would take away the vice-chancellors'' powers. earlier also, such a move was opposed by a students'' representatives of all the universities. the act even seeks to cut into the students'' representation in the university boards. this would not be acceptable to students."" to this, minister of state for higher education hemant chapatwala replied, ""we would look into the problem. the act would not be promulgated before making a thorough study of the issues involved. the governor''s views would also be taken."""	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 26, 2002  gandhinagar/ahmedabad: those talking about normalcy returning to gujarat perhaps have in mind the crowds that have been thronging the state''s first mcdonald''s outlet in ahmedabad since it opened last thursday. mcdonald''s india (western region) managing director amit jatia says during the first five days of the restaurant''s opening, which had to be postponed because of the riots, about 30,000 people visited it, evoking an unbelievable response in these troubled times. but the fast food chain''s success paints a false picture of normalcy in a city that has lost nearly 300 lives so far. a month after the senseless attack on the sabarmati express carrying ram sevaks from ayodhya on february 27, gujarat is still feeling the heat coming out of the burnt down s-6 compartment. the first week of frenzy had just died down when the march 15 ''shila pujan'' in ayodhya fuelled a fresh bout of violence, which has so far taken another 30 lives. and now, with holi''s potential for mischief later this week, nobody out of the nearly one lakh refugees at the relief camps is willing to return home. most of them actually have no homes to go back to, and even if they haven''t been burnt down, the fear is so overwhelming that they are willing to slog it out in filthy camps than risk another mob attack. consider the statistics of the month-long nightmare gujarat has lived: the official toll stands at 783 and, with each passing day, is stealthily inching closer to the 800 mark. nearly 97,998 people live in 101 relief camps. the government has declared different packages, including that of providing rs 5,000 to rs 50,000 as compensation to those whose houses have been gutted, but the claimants don''t know where to rebuild their houses. police statistics show 125 people have died in police firing. the police fired 6,500 rounds, exploded 8,300 tear-gas shells and has arrested a staggering 10,000 people. impressive statistics these. but nobody''s impressed, not the all-party mps delegation neither the national commission for minorities nor the national human rights commission. the impact of violence is writ large not only in the city''s relief camps but also in the nearly 30 towns and cities of gujarat, still under curfew, as the police, beaten black and blue because of its initial sluggishness, is not taking any chances in the build-up to holi. the violence in the first three days, or 72 hours as chief minister narendra modi likes to put it, has given way to a low intensity but sustained war where students going to examination halls have been stabbed, nurses going to hospitals on night shifts attacked with acid bombs, individuals having married outside the community have been hunted down and killed and people being escorted to safety by the police lynched. ask the chief minister when all this will end and he finds a rather strange synchronisation between opposition mps and the mobs. the violence will end when the lok sabha session ends, he declared at a recent meeting in rajkot. the toll and the shattered psyche apart, it''s the financial punch that the riots have delivered that''s now beginning to tell. confederation of indian industry and gujarat chambers of commerce and industry estimates show business losses in the last month ranging between rs 2,000 crore and rs 2,250 crore. something, that a state which was already reeling under the impact of the quake just couldn''t afford. but in some ways, many believe the killer quake was, perhaps, better than the riots. at least, it brought people together.	1	1	1	1	1

"This story is from March 24, 2002  mumbai: when mumbai was in flames during the post-babri masjid riots of 1992-aEUR(tm)93, a zone of armed peace existed in the very heart of the furnace. on the noisy dr ambedkar road in byculla, the hanuman mandir and moti masjid, which share a compound wall and a bloody history, kept the peace of the neighbourhood. in that riot-torn winter, while mobs howled and neighbouring nagpada was charred to a cinder, the namaz and aarti here went on undisturbed even as vanloads of policemen kept a tense vigil outside. the police watch was repeated this month on friday the 15th when the ayodhya bomb threatened to explode again, the vhpaEUR(tm)s ghantaanad programme hung in the air like a loyalty test of sorts, and the blood of gujarat dripped endlessly on television screens across the country. the aEUR~sensitive areasaEUR(tm) of the city were zeroed in on and the byculla mandir-masjid zone registered an alarming high on the sensitivity index. mumbai held its breath and put its faith in the decade-long work of the mohalla committees, which had been particularly active in the locality. when the evening call for prayer went out as usual and night fell without a single stone being thrown or lathi being raised, the neighbourhood knew that it had turned the corner. mohammed ayub inayatullah, who is president of the local mohalla committee and has the standing of an elder in the community, is proud of the fact that journalists aEURoefrom out of indiaaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) have come to document the peaceful cohabitance of the shrines. aEURoethere was a time when the ringing of bells and the aazan competed with each other,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he says, aEURoebut that is a thing of the past. during the 1992 riots, i went around telling hindu shopkeepers to open their shops and not be afraid because we were with them. everywhere else there was rioting, here no one was harmed.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) at which point one asks the question that begs to be asked, at what price peace? for, the byculla peace, like most cultivated peace efforts, has a bloody benediction. the pujari of the hanuman temple will tell you that the old-timers of bombay refer to the hanuman mandir as danga maruti, given the number of skirmishes it sparked off. the spokesperson of the moti masjid will also vouch for the fact that both parties have been obdurate in the pastaEUR""the muslims objecting to the bhajans, the hindus to the azanaEUR""but since they are destined to aEURoecut time togetheraEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) they have adopted the policy of peaceful non-interference. there have even been occasions when one has lent the other water at festival time. aEURoeas a child i remember we used to find it hard to get workmen to come here for any kind of repairs,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says p. p. rahurkar, whose family has owned the hanuman temple for generations. aEURoei also remember that during the communal riots of 1946 my father, who was the pujari, was given special police protection. in fact, he wasnaEUR(tm)t even allowed to stay on the temple premises because of the threat to his life. he used to be escorted here for the puja and then taken back.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) what does it feel like to be the custodians of the only hindu shrine in an otherwise muslim locality? aEURoewhenever there is communal trouble elsewhere we get a little worried, especially since we are the only hindus here. but then we have faith in our neighbours. we have co-operated with each other for so many years and we are confident of their support,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says rahurkar. the 300-year-old mandir and 150-year-old masjid stand dome to dome without even a token strip of white to separate the saffron from running into the green or vice versa. islamic words of prayer float past the mandir and the sound of bells can be heard in the masjid. to complete the tableau is the gloria church across the road which scorns the flyover in front of it and reaches straight for the sky. the half-century of respectful co-existence has become a metaphor, if not for something as utopian as religious brotherhood, at least for the kind of secularism envisaged by the founders of the modern indian nation.

This story is from March 25, 2002  kolkata: annoyed over instances of corruption in the west bengal electricity board, bosses in writersaEUR(tm) buildings and alimuddin street have pulled up state power minister mrinal banerjee. protests against corruption have cost a senior seb official his chair. cpm sources told tnn on saturday that chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee, cpm state secretary anil biswas and industries minister nirupam sen had openly expressed their displeasure over the power ministeraEUR(tm)s inability to check corruption in the seb. the issue was raised during a recent state secretariat meeting of the cpm by former transport minister shyamal chakraborty. according to sources, chakraborty submitted documentary evidence of corruption rampant in the seb. both bhattacharjee and biswas reportedly criticised banerjeeaEUR(tm)s consistent failure to stop malpractices in the seb. the matter came to a head when it was learnt the seb was making arrangements to purchase power meters worth rs 56.92 crore from the marketing agents of a rajasthan-based private company where a senior vhp leader reportedly has a stake. apart from the political ramifications of purchasing material from a company in which a vhp leader was involved, it was also observed that the price of the power meters quoted by the company was 40 per cent higher than sebaEUR(tm)s original estimated cost of rs 40 crore. allegations of corruption were also raised from within the six- member board of the seb regarding purchase of aluminium conductors worth rs 15 crore from another company. amitava roy choudhury, member (technical) of the board, had objected to the contract on the grounds that the concerned company was selling the same product to bihar and gujarat at a much lower price. at a board meeting of the seb last monday, when roy choudhury raised allegations of corruption, he was curtly asked to resign. when he refused to do so, the board was reconstituted the very next day. roy choudhury was the only member to be dropped from the board while all the others members were retained. in his dissenting note, roy choudhury brought charges of large-scale corruption in both the deals. aEURoenecessary unbiased inquiry is required to be held from the proper level to find out the reason why malpractice was adopted,aEUR he wrote in his note. he said he expected senior ministers in the state cabinet to intervene and order a full inquiry into both the deals. aEURoeonly then can corruption in the seb be stopped once and for all,aEUR he said. power minister mrinal banerjee, who was in hyderbabd, was not available for comment.	0	0	0	0	0

"This story is from March 31, 2002  former kolkata sheriff amiya gooptu believes bengal can make it to the top. as chairman of the independent think-tank bengal initiative, he shoulders the responsibility of leading the group in chalking out growth paths for the region. holding mutiple posts including the trusteeship of academy of fine arts, president of indian council for cultural relations and bengal table tennis association, working president of society for preservation and directorship of reputed companies, he took time off to speak to subhro niyogi on bi. what is bengal initiative? it is an independent think tank without any political association and comprises successful people who volunteer to take upon themselves the responsibility of coming with new and fresh ideas. bi was first formed around 1905 during the swadeshi days at the instance of visionaries like p.c. ray, dadabhai naoroji, c.r. das, upendranath sen, f.n. gooptu and others. it was a time when native chambers of commerce were not strong enough and the indian business community did not have a representative voice. bi emerged as a spokesman for indian interests and prepared action plans on education, social welfare, media, tariff policies and employment generation. times have changed. but the over-riding compulsion for self-improvement has not. after over nine decades, bi continues to seek and uphold the same values of its august predecessors. what is the primary concern at bi today? west bengal today occupies the fifth position in terms of trade and development in the country. the immediate concern is to ensure that the state tops the chart. it does not end there though. for in a globalised economy, bengal has to compete with the world. and we have a long way to go before we catch up with the rest. instead of setting gujarat or maharashtra as the yardstick, bengal has to look at cities in china or south-east asia. only then can you become a role model state in the country. so bi believes that bengal has the potential to turn as competitive as the nations to its east? definitely. west bengal is historically, culturally and geographically placed to make the quantum leap. just saying that the state has the potential to become indiaaEUR(tm)s gateway to s-e asia is not enough. the dream has to be realised. west bengal, the northeast, nepal, bangladesh, bhutan, myanmar, sri lanka, thailand and south china comprise a 450 million people market. the vision has to extend beyond borders. one of the biggest export opportunities for bengal is on the culture front. and yes, there are opportunities in healthcare, education, tea, jute, food processing, information technology and other sectors. could you elaborate on culture being a potential export? bengalaEUR(tm)s culture is a brand. our heritage, language, literature, music, dance, art, theatre aEUR"" they are revered the world over. yet, the exposure has not been to the desired level. and there has been hardly any efforts to package it for the audience outside the state. rabindranath has drawn upon cultures in the east on many occasions, be it tasher chandalika or chitrangada. they just need to be packaged for the particular audience. bengali cuisine too is a part of our culture. given the similar diet on fish and rice, there are opportunities galore to hardsell bengali cuisine in these countries. has bi been able to achieve anything in this direction? bi delegations has been visiting several countries to bring people closer to each other. last year, we visisted myanmar. it was the first indian delegation to the country for a long time. the decision to re-establish embassies in kolkata and mandalay can perhaps, be attributed to the visit. china too must have a consulate in kolkata. what are the areas in the government where a change is necessary? everyone in the government has to be honest about their work. advanced nations have administrations that are speedy and transparent. perhaps, thataEUR(tm)s because public opinion is very strong there. why canaEUR(tm)t our ministers hold departmental press conferences three or four times a year? one has to realise that the mandate does not entitle them to be answerable to the people once every five years.

This story is from March 15, 2002  mumbai: civil rights activists have demanded that the inquiry into the riots in gujarat be conducted by a panel of sitting judges of a high court outside gujarat or the supreme court. only that would ensure an independent inquiry given that an atmosphere of coercion and brutality still prevailed in gujarat, they said. the activists, including girish patel, fr cedric prakash and sophia khan, said that since the stateaEUR(tm)s complicity in the rioting was evident, a retired judge from the gujarat high court appointed by the government would not be able to deal with the issue objectively. besides, they said, justice k.g. shah, who had been appointed to the inquiry commission, was not in the best of health. the reason for demanding a representative panel of sitting judges and not a single retired judge was that the appointment of the former was made by the chief justice and of the latter by the state, said activists mihir desai and teesta setalvad. concerned citizens have also pressed for an expansion of the terms of reference of the commission appointed by the government. they want it to include the buildup of the political and social atmosphere which led to the incidents at godhra and the rest of gujarat. meanwhile, observers from mumbai, who are now in gujarat, say that atrocities against the minorities in gujarat continue, although on a reduced scale. the villages on the outskirts of anand have doggedly resisted violent threats to their muslim inhabitants. to pressurise the hindus from these villages, the local vhp has been sending them a set of bangles every day. but so far, the locals have held out. aEURoewe learnt that two days ago a minister from the state cabinet addressed a meeting of villagers decrying them for not having taken to violence,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) said activist sushobha barve. she said what was happening in gujarat was not communal rioting but ethnic cleansing, genocide. there was also a serious problem of sanitation in relief camps. the bajrang dal, in the last couple of years, has created a trained, private militia. every account that the observers received before their arrival in gujarat, which was corroborated on arrival there, points to the role played by such an outfit in the recent carnage. in every incident in gujarat in the last few days, the mobs leading the attacks were not the usual riot mobs.they were five to 15,000 in number, collected swiftly, and they destroyed life and property quickly and brutally.	0	0	0	0	0

"ayodhya: a day after his shila daan programme ended in an anti-climax, ram janambhoomi nyas president ramchandra das paramhans on saturday sought to justify the change of venue, saying he had saved the government''s honour and asserted that ram temple could be built only through use of force.       read this story in...          A A hindi    ""i abided by the supreme court decision (by not performing the shila daan near the acquired land). i saved the government''s lajja,"" paramhans told reporters here. ""there could have been bloodshed, had i gone ahead with my plan of donating the shila near the acquired land. that is why i dispersed the kar sevaks who had come along with me,"" he said. paramhans claimed that he had ""technically carried out the shila daan at the pre-planned place as one of shila was donated at ramkot mohalla close to the acquired land."" he said that he had refused to donate the shila to divisional commissioner a k gupta, who is the official receiver of the acquired land, as he did not trust him. ""the shila is now secure and will be used when temple construction work begins"" he said, adding friday''s programme marked the ""beginning of ram temple construction"". on the next move, paramhans said that it would be very sensitive but refused to elaborate. however, he said ""as the babri mosque was built by force, the temple would also be built by force in the same way the mosque was demolished by ram sevaks. in this world, only takat (force) works."" asked whether use of force would not amount to contempt of court, the mahant of digambar akhara said ""nobody can accept any verdict against religious beliefs of a community."" related stories:A temple will be construced: nyas chief A sc judgements:1994A A wednesday''s A A thursday''s A ayodhya: a brief historyA full coverageA A A voice your opinion    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0
"This story is from March 17, 2002  ahmedabad/vadodara: riot-hit denizens of gujarat are resorting to whatever means possible to save their homes and commercial establishments. after arming themselves with hockey sticks and baseball bats, they have now taken to wearing their religion on their sleeve, literally. all this just in case a mob makes a mistake and they end up getting caught in the crossfire. when rioters began torching shops in ahmedabad, the owner of mehfil restaurant could not help cursing himself for giving his joint an urdu name. in a last-ditch attempt, he put up a board outside saying: ""jai shri ram. proprietor-partner rg singh and balwant singh"". mehfil, near the sattadhar crossing on sola road, remains intact. ''jai shri ram'' and posters of hindu gods and goddesses have now become passwords to survival for those who live in mixed localities or have controversial names that can be mistaken as belonging to that of the minority community. a perfect example is naroda-patia where hindus and muslims lived together in a labyrinth of houses. since the gruesome massacre in which nearly 75 persons were killed, only a handful of hindu families have remained as they have no option. and they are letting the world know they are hindus. posters of goddess saraswati have been prominently displayed at entrances. while ''jai shri ram'' is ubiquitous, a combination of vegetables is another way out. the first thing many hung outside their shops after the riots was the tried-and-tested chilly-lemon combination. garment shops along c g road, with names which could raise eyebrows, all had the combo hanging outside. mango leaves were also in demand. after an automobile showroom on the sarkhej-gandhinagar highway as burnt down, satnambhai, who does not have any specific name for his shop, has lined the entrance of his garage with mango leaves - a traditional hindu way to bring good luck. fresh swastiks, the symbolic om and ''jai shree ganesh'' are among the signs that surfaced overnight on the walls and shutters of mechanics and grocers at naroda, bapunagar and memnagar in ahmedabad. on the samjuba hospital road in bapunagar, the all-glass bajaj showroom was spared only because ''shri ram'' was prominently painted on the panes. in vadodara, a number of houses have ''ram'' painted on their doors in bold while shopkeepers have hung boards proclaiming: ""this shop belongs to a hindu"". fear has also led many to keep coconuts on a kalash near their doorsteps. in karelibaug, some societies have pasted posters of hindu gods and goddesses at their gates. after all, rioters have to be stopped early, before the first stone is pelted.

This story is from March 15, 2002  patna: the cpi(ml)'s 'loktantra bachao' rally on thursday called upon all secular and progressive forces of bihar to reiterate their resolve to defeat the communal, fascist offensive and thereby save and strengthen democracy in the country. addressing a mammoth gathering here at the gandhi maidan, party's general secretary dipankar bhattacharya gave a fervent call to overthrow the vajpayee government to protect the country's secular foundation and national unity. in protest against communal frenzy, the party has decided to launch a national unity campaign throughout the country from may 4 to 10. bhattacharya, in his 45-minute speech, said the ruling rjd-congress coalition government in bihar had proved absolutely incapable of providing even a minimum sense of security to the toiling masses. the prevailing misrule of laloo prasad yadav is underlined by spate of kidnappings and massacres in the state, he added. the state is reeling under extreme economic backwardness. discredited political leaders of bihar add insult to the injury as they indulge in empty rhetoric and extravagant political shows in the name of development and reconstruction, bhattacharya said. the components of both the nda and rjd-congress coalitions are competing among themselves to promote criminalisation of bihar's economy and politics. they are squarely to be blamed for the state's alarming descent into an absolute anarchy, he pointed out. laloo ban gaya spokesman, he said, adding: now laloo is planning to go to delhi as a rajya sabha member to project sonia gandhi as a leader. bhattacharya said the party's red flag will be the torch bearer for making a new bihar. because all the so-called disciples of jp have become irrelevant, he added. he said development has never been even a key slogan for the scam tainted state government, while no union minister or so-called disciples of jp have succeeded in securing for bihar any concrete measures to match the development agenda. in this regard, he mentioned the names of union ministers nitish kumar and ram vilas paswan. bhattacharya said his party had already launched a movement for making a new bihar. we strongly believe that the question of development of bihar must be made the central agenda of politics. needs and aspirations of the toiling masses, youths and students must be placed at the centre of the state's development, he argued. the party has decided to donate a sum of rs 1 lakh for the victims of gujarat riots. he said at least 37,000 affected people are still living in 14 relief camps. they are being looked after by various individual groups, he said. the cpi(ml)'s thursday rally has succeeded in making its presence felt in residual bihar. a large number of contigents from champaran, darbhanga, katihar, madhubani, saharsa and kishanganj had arrived here to attend the rally. earlier, rallyists led by bhattacharya and other senior party leaders took out a procession shouting slogans like mandir ki rajniti band karo, ram ke naam kaa katleaam band karo from the southern side of the gandhi maidan at around 11 am, which, passing through exhibition road, chiraiyatand, station road, fraser road, terminated at the gandhi maidan. prominent among those who spoke on the occasion were ashok manohar of lal nishan party of maharashtra, akhilendra pratap singh (party's state secretary in uttar pradesh), mahendra singh (leader of the cpi-ml's legislature party in jharkhand), raja ram singh, mehboob alam and ram naresh ram (all party mlas from bihar).	0	0	0	0	0
"This story is from March 27, 2002  lucknow: the vishwa hindu parshad has convened a session of the kendriya marg darshak mandal, the organisation''s highest decision-making body, on june 22 at rishikesh to chalk out a strategy for the second-phase of the temple construction movement. the march 15 ''flop show'' has caused some serious rethinking among the vhp leadership. ""it''s time not only to review relations with the bjp but also for an action plan to renew the temple construction movement,"" stated a senior vhp functionary. the vhp seems to be charting out a two-pronged strategy. first, an action plan to mobilise the cadre and create a 1990 and 1992-like build-up. secondly, trigger off a debate within the bjp between the hardliners and the moderate on the temple construction issue to corner the latter. a five-member core group has already been set-up for this purpose. after completion of the ''purna ahuti yajna'' on june 2 in ayodhya the 185-member kendriya marg darshak mandal will set the ball rolling for the vhp and bajrang dal cadre on june 22 at rishikesh. ailing vhp working president ashok singhal has called his close confidante to allahabad to draft the agenda for the emergency kendriya marg darshak mandal meeting. invitation are being extended to all the four seers besides all prominent vhp saints and sadhus associated with the temple movement. soonafter the june 22 emergency session, the vhp has convened a week-long governing council meeting between july 4 and 10 at ranchi. the 250-member governing council will ratify the decisions taken at the kendriya marg darshak mandal meeting and give final shape to its second-phase programmes. the vhp programmes for the second-phase include mass contact and awareness campaigns all over the country. under the plan, the vhp would begin ''ram naam japs'' in all villages and extend ''purna ahuti yajnas'' to all parts of the country. the vhp and the bajrang dal activists have already been directed to make themselves free for two-months in mid-july. they will be asked to fan out all over the country for carrying out the vhp programmes. ''ram naam kirtans'' would be organised in towns and cities to mobilise support in favour of the temple movement. the vhp is also making audio-visual tapes on godhra incident and on government''s crackdown on ram sevaks in ayodhya. a private television company has been requested to provide the footage for the same. the vhp is still hopeful that the court verdict would go in their favour. a battery of lawyers have been engaged and documentary evidences are being procured to authenticate their claim on the undisputed land. the vhp has also requested a top asi official to verify artefacts found during excavation at the sanctum sanctorum with an aim to use them as evidence for temple''s existence."	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 15, 2002  ahmedabad: gujarat is once again on tenterhooks on the eve of an explosive situation developing at ayodhya. and, for once, neither the state government nor the police can complain about lack of security forces to control the situation with both the army and the para-military forces already deployed in the areas affected by riots over the last two weeks. it is a tinderbox-like situation in the state which has already seen over 700 killings in communal violence after the godhra train massacre on february 27. it being a friday and muslims expected to visit mosques for their afternoon prayers in an already tense atmosphere, the decision of the vishwa hindu parishad to organise mass ram dhun programme at 2.15 pm has set the stage for a possible confrontation. state vhp general secretary dilip trivedi and state bajrang dal president ranchhod bharwad issued a joint statement calling upon hindus to join the mass prayers to coincide with the rituals being planned at ayodhya despite the supreme court's embargo.	0	0	1	0	0
This story is from March 15, 2002  mangalore: pejavar math pontiff and senior vhp leader vishwesha theertha swamiji on thursday suggested a referendum on the construction of a ram temple in ayodhya. reacting to the supreme court ruling staying any kind of puja on either the disputed or undisputed site, he said the order is ``only interim'' and all should await the final verdict. everybody must abide by the verdict of the apex court. the seer said the march 15 deadline set by the temple protagonists should be extended. he, however, hastened to add that there is no difference of opinion on the construction of a ram temple. he claimed the temple issue has never been a political proposition and that the bjp is not seeking votes in the name of the temple. appealing for a peaceful settlement, he remarked that one should not provoke violence nor react to it. the vhp has never instigated communal tension, he maintained. stating that sadhus and sants were not responsible for the godhra incident and the subsequent carnage in gujarat, the seer said the culprits must be tackled with an iron hand. ``i am willing to fast if any kind of violence erupts in ayodhya during the construction of the temple,'' he said.	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 21, 2002  ayodhya: on a peace mission here, union minister of youth welfare and sports uma bharti on wednesday emphasised on court verdict as well as out of court settlement through talks to settle the ayodhya dispute once for all. aEURoeany decision on disputed shrine will be perfect if court verdict comes along with successful talks leading to satisfaction of all concerned. therefore, besides insisting for an early judicial verdict,efforts for an out of court settlement must also continue,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) said uma bharti. on a dayaEUR(tm)s visit to the temple town ,uma bharti talking to mediapersons at tulsi smarak bhawan ,said ,aEUR~aEUR~ ayodhya is legal as well as very sensitive sentimental issue and needs to be settled to the absolute satisfaction of all parties concerned.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) she said that as both minority and majority communities were eager to maintain communal amity in the country, creation of a conducive atmosphere would work as a strong base for meaningful dialogue to settle this knotty issue. uma bharti, who has been a front-running leader of ram temple movement from 1983 to december 6,1992 ,on wednesday spoke in a different tone and stressed on the importance of secular character of the country. means for an amicable solution of the dispute need to be sincerely indentified and aEUR~sourcesaEUR(tm) (persons) who really matter , tapped,she emphasised. when asked to elaborate the attempts being made in this direction she refused to give details but quoted a statement given by naib imam of mecca at darul uloom nadwa at lucknow sometime ago advising muslims to give up their claim of disputed site if it was proved that the mosque was built after demolishing the temple. earlier, ms bharti accompanied by bjp mp swami chinmayanand called upon vhp supremo ashok singhal and had discussions with him in a closed room at karsewakpuram.she is believed to have delivered a personal message of prime minister atal behari vajpayee to the vhp leader. later she went to rjb complex to worship the sitting deity at the makeshift temple. she also visited digambar akhara and held discussions with rjn chief paramhans ramchandra das. political observers here feel that her visit on the occasion of ongoing two- day crucial meeting of vhp high-command was intended to bridge the increasing gap between bjp leadership at the centre and the vhp. meanwhile, the two- day meeting of vhp being attended by its top functionaries started here at karsewakpuram on wednesday morning to take stock of the situation in post march 15 shila dan programme and to formulate frash strategy for temple construction movement.  	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 21, 2002  lucknow: the shankaracharya of govardhan math puri swami nishchalanand sarswati dev tirth has favoured the construction of ram temple at ayodhya by developing a proper understanding between the two communities and without any use of force. but, at the same time he said that the generosity of hindus should not be treated as weakness. in an interview with tnn on wednesday, he emphasised the need of protecting the ideals of hindus, security and integrity of the nation by protecting humanitarian values and keeping in mind the interest of other communities, aEURoewhich is the fundamental spirit the indian constitutionaEUR. he said that it should be protected by the court, parliament and the people. aEURoeindia is the only country where muslims have occupied the top positions in every field, whereas in countries like pakistan, bangladesh and other muslim countries, no hindu could ever dream of it,aEUR he added. the shankaracharya said that starting from rajiv gandhi, successive prime ministers had neglected the issue of ram temple at ayodhya and had failed to give due importance to it. he asserted that this issue was not less important than the security of the borders of the country. he said that callous attitude of the successive governments had not only caused undue delay in the construction of the temple, but had also helped in creating tension between the hindus and the muslims. he said that politicians had oppressed hindus for the last 54 years and if they continued to do so, it might result in an aEUR~explosion at any timeaEUR(tm). he lamented that due to mishandling of this issue, the ram janmabhoomi (birth place of ram) had become the centre of power politics. underlining the need of constructing a magnificent temple there, he said that it should be built without the use of bullet and abuse, in the same manner in which the the construction of somanath temple was made possible by sardar vallabh bhai patel as the home minister of india soon after independence. when asked if he would like to intervene to solve the ayodhya problem, he said that during the prime ministership of pv narsimha rao, the pm, the vhp chief and the bjp president used to keep him apprised of the developments in ayodhya, but now he was not being consulted by any one. he said that a day before the dhrama sansad held at allahabad during maha kumbh, when vhp leaders came to him for his advise, he had clearly told them that instead of trying to construct temple on a land occupied forcibly, it should be done by creating mass awareness. he said that there was no dearth of intellectuals either in rss, congress or in other parties, but the problem was that they were being neglected badly.  	0	0	0	0	0

"This story is from March 25, 2002  anand: tension prevailed in anand and its outskirts as a huge crowd gathered at a 150-year-old temple in sarsa to protect it from an alleged threat to ""blow it up"" on monday morning. the threat seemed a deliberate attempt to keep the tension simmering in central gujarat. a notice, written on the back of a carpet and pasted on sunday clandestinely on a school in sarsa, 11 km from anand city, claimed that the sat keval temple will be ""blown up by a remote-controlled device at 8.15 am on monday."" this created panic among the residents and followers of the temple. by 8 am, a crowd had gathered on its premises, which vowed to ""protect the temple from any damage"". the notice had also threatened to blow up a school run by the kaival gnanpith gurugadi sarsapuri, the same trust that runs the temple, at 8.30 am. ""the police did provide us protection but this is a temporary arrangement. whoever pasted the poster wanted to create trouble in this area. this temple has a mix of both hindu and muslim architecture and is an example of brotherhood and amity,"" said temple head swami avichaldasji.

""whatever has happened is determined. we''re ready to lay down our lives to save the temple,"" said another resident, kanubhai rohit. though anand sp bd vaghela felt the poster was ""a handiwork of mischief mongers"", the crowd was parked in the temple premises throughout the morning and raised slogans bharat mata ki jai. ""it was done to create mischief but certainly the idea was to pro-voke people,"" said vaghela. some arrests have also been made and people booked for ""inciting violence"". in the city, an uneasy calm prevailed despite lifting of curfew between 10 am and 6 pm on monday. curfew had to be imposed on the city on sunday night as violence broke out in a number of areas like gujarati chowk, sau foot road area and ismail nagar. curfew remained clamped on borsad, where one person was stabbed on sunday. according to the police, trouble broke out when mobs came face to face and began pelting stones, injuring a woman in the gujarati chowk area around 11 pm. police had to fire six rounds to disperse the mob. another six rounds were fired and tear-gas shells were burst in ismail nagar. though curfew was relaxed during the day, people hardly ventured out of their homes and shops remained closed.

new delhi: sms (short messaging service) over the cell phone is emerging as the preferred mode of communication of terrorist groups across the world, say intelligence sources here. according to officials, the move to sms is happening because terrorists and criminals have found out the hard way that using voice over cellphones and e-mails can turn out to be major giveaways. vital information has been procured by investigating agencies courtesy retrieval of e-mail and cell phone records. ``the reason that sms is being used is because the messages leave no trace whatsoever,'''' says an official with the intelligence bureau. there is no technology as yet that can tap messages on sms and given the millions of messages that traverse, it is a near impossible task, say sources. that e-mails can boomerang on criminal groups has been borne out by the arrest of underworld don aftab ansari. more than 15 e-mail ids of ansari have been procured after his arrest that have revealed several incriminating evidence. similarly, in pakistan, the initial breakthrough was achieved through tracing e-mails. it led to the arrest of omar sheikh, the main accused in the murder of wsj journalist daniel pearl. ansari''s e-mails to sheikh divulged that the same network was also involved in financing the attacks on the world trade towers in new york. in the recent past, investigating agencies here have managed to crack several e-mails of known criminals such as dawood ibrahim, chhota rajan. further, there is technology now available that can track e-mails. various agencies, including the central bureau of investigation, the intelligence bureau and delhi police, have been holding several meetings in the recent past to surmount the issue of tracing sms, but there is no solution at hand. ``at the most a cellular circle of a particular area can be jammed, as happened following the attack on the parliament house but these measures can be taken only for crisis management,'''' says an official. the sms has been the hottest application to hit india''s mobile services and its popularity has spread far beyond metro cities. in haryana, kerala and up (west), one of the prominent cellular operators the escorts group owned escotel has seen upwards of 7 million sms messages per month. for the four circles of mp, maharashtra, ap and gujarat, bpl-at&t-tata has a volume of around 15-20 million messages per month. related stories:A ib canaEUR(tm)t figure out sms, wants it shut downA police blocks sms for six hours    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail	0	1	1	0	0

"This story is from March 25, 2002  palanpur: the north gujarat university (ngu) has postponed its first-year and third-year examinations for the second time. earlier, the programme was rescheduled from march 18 to march 26, and all the 35 centres were directed to suspend the examination. according to the registrar of ngu, bharat shah, the decision of the university to postpone the examination came in view of unabated communal riots. at some places it was rather not feasible to conduct the examination. according to vice-chancellor balawant jani, the revised schedule of the examination will be issued soon. over 38,000 students were scheduled to appear for their examinations. a third-year student of arts, snehal patel, is upset over the postponement of her examination as she is to be married next month and she would like to finish giving the exams by then. ankit rawal, a student of first-year bsc, too favours an early examination. according to him the ngu could have, at least, conducted the examination at the non-affected areas. milli, a first-year engineering student, is however happy with the decision. she said, ""it was not possible to stay a day more in the hostel in modasa. i wish the university would consider alternatives like mass promotion or conducting the exams at patan or some other relatively safer place, instead of making swift changes in its examination schedule."" ""we will not plead for mass promotion as it has in the past harmed the career of the students, the judiciary has also in the past criticised such a move"" maintains nsui district president karansinh. he added, ""so as to avoid further delay, we would urge the ngu authorities to entrust the examination work to the respective colleges."" on the other hand, the some parents too have criticised the move of postponing the examinations. ""the postponement of the examinations have kept us in a condition of suspended animation as under the present circumstances, we cannot attend social functions like marriages and other social engagements,"" said one parent. rash bhai panchal had planned to avail some days during the vacation out of the state at some hilly resort far from the fear and fret. the present unprecedented condition has up set his long back contrived programme."	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 25, 2002  even after three weeks of turbulence in ahmedabad and ayodhya, the fm has remained stoically silent. perhaps it hasn''t struck him that some scientific exercises need to be undertaken for assessing the impact on the economy and the conclusions need to be shared with business. in gujarat, businesses are now trying to figure out ways of staying competitive nationally. global competitiveness is passe. but one must not assume that he is ignorant. may be he has already appointed a global consultant to work out financial implications of the situation and one hopes that the harvard graduates would find some way of extrapolating the future course of events in naroda and narol. incidentally, the bjp (oops, sorry, nda) government has spent quite liberally for buying business advice from abroad. unmindful of the expanding end usage of lpg cylinders, he nonchalantly rolled back prices by rs 20 a cylinder last week. in an equally uncharacteristic reaction, the media used the word rollback rather sparingly and even failed to call him saffron sinha, for having reduced the cost of arson. never mind. as ''kautilya'' jairam ramesh of congress says, the costs are being met with dollars provided by nrgs. the hike, even sans the rollback, would have been less than a dollar! it is increasingly being realised that economic disparities can be as much a consequence of, as a reason behind, communal flare-ups. mundane issues like unemployment and education are beginning to find their way back into dictionaries of modern economic thinkers, though reality is yet to bite the sensex. ase is, in fact, gung ho about its plans for trade in commodities futures. when will india realise that speculation is a rich man''s game? trading in cotton futures was banned in 1967 because volatility in prices exceeded all limits. futures have been re-introduced for imparting stability to cotton prices! interest subsidy and deferment of sales-tax and energy bills for riot hit industrial units have been announced but that is unlikely to be of much help. there is no way a business can be compensated for loss of markets in today''s intensely competitive environment. besides, what is the guarantee that there would be no flare ups in future? clearly, besides the temporary relief measures, political and social solutions have to be found, with some sense of urgency. one indicator of the extent to which human revulsion can affect business is the fact that surat weavers are willing to forego a good four per cent of their sales (cenvat credits) for staying free from the clutches of excise officials! believe it or not, many would close shop but would not have anything to do with excise officers. corporate news that came in last week was essentially old hat - gipcl''s 160 mw power plant has secured gas linkage, government is planning to sell its stake in gspc, amtrex hitachi hopes to hike sales by 40 per cent and arvind is upbeat on denim. mcdonald''s made its debut in ahmedabad, amul announced more launched and etv, which is reportedly being eyed by zee, earned high ratings in the last few weeks. perhaps the only interesting news was that while corporate bank officers are planning a strike on 30th because the management is not offering a vrs, bank of baroda employees would go on a strike on 30th because the management is going ahead with a vrs. some politico should recognise the opportunity and demand reservations in vrs. inadequate news from corporate circles need not really cause worry. the level has been low for quite some time. as has been said earlier in this column, growth interregnums are very essential for improving the quality of life. aren''t religion and spiritualism the buzz words now? notwithstanding the claims of the fm and the readings of the barometer that the sensex is supposed to be, the macro scene continues to be gloomy. everything seems to be at a standstill. business has been gripped by inaction. whether it is indeed possible to do something about the state of affairs is an open question but at least one can be spared the agony of having to read false claims of growth! down south, and up north, everybody is asking why riots take place so frequently only in gujarat? the question is being asked by those whose women are unable to drive two wheelers because their society isn''t decent enough. do not panic. time never fails to heal. sooner or later, things would stabilise. back in 1945, who had imagined that germany and japan would be able to regain their respective positions in the global hierarchy? of course india isn''t germany or japan but make no mistake, gujarat has been, and shall always be, india''s japan!	0	0	0	0	0
"new delhi: a day after the gujarat government submitted its ""comprehensive"" report on the recent communal violence to it, national human rights commission (nhrc) held a meeting here on thursday. commission sources said the report did not come up for deliberations in the ""full"" commission meeting with the ""revised"" copy of the report being received only on thursday and most of the members yet to read it fully. the voluminous report submitted by the state government to nhrc on wednesday had nearly 20 pages missing. ""the state government had apologised for the mistake and had assured that the mistake will be corrected immediately,"" sources said. informed sources also said the commission will hold a meeting in next few days to discuss the gujarat report. thursday''s meeting came in the backdrop of a public interest litigation (pil) filed by an ahemdabad-based organisation, karuna public cheritable trust, in the city high court. the pil had challenged the jurisdiction of nhrc under section 36 of protection of human rights act (phra) to intervene in gujarat. the commission had strongly criticised the handling of the situation by the gujarat government during the communal riots leading to ""insecurity"" among the people of the state. it had also rejected the preliminary report by the state government as ""perfunctory"" and demanded a comprehensive report into the incidents of violence and steps taken for prevention and protection of the people. besides the main report in about 135 pages, the revised document filed by the state government also carries annexures numbering around 265. claiming that all possible steps were taken to control the situation and for the protection of members of the minority community, the report also points out measures taken for smooth running of state activities including conduct of school examinations, deployment of police and para-military forces among other issues. the annexures enclosed with the report were on law and order, relief and rehabilitation and responses to the media coverage.

"This story is from March 31, 2002  ahmedabad: the month-long communal carnage may have gagged those living into a terrorised silence, but the dead too are telling tales of just how insecure gujarat has become. post-riots, the dead are orphaned as the living refuse to come out of the shadows of communal madness even to pay last respects to their near and dear ones. saving one''s skin is of prime concern... let others go into cold storage, literally. take chimanbhai soni, who died of cancer more than 20 days back. his relatives have not mustered enough courage to come and claim his body. so his body has been kept in the cold storage of the post-mortem room of the civil hospital anticipating that his relatives may be stuck in one of the curfew-bound areas and may come looking for him once normalcy is restored! or take soniben from sanger who died of accidental burns in the city. the law says that her body be handed over only to her blood relations, and not the in-laws, but who will dare to venture out in a state that is burning with communal rage with no signs of peace in sight! there are at least 40-odd bodies that have their identifications intact but are lying in the city''s hospital morgues for want of takers. incidentally, not all of them are riot-hit but are victims of the riotous times nevertheless. ""it is a reflection of the distraught state of mind the society is in. people are so scared, they would rather leave the dead in cold than stick their necks out,"" said a doctor. interestingly here, more than 120 badly charred bodies had remained unclaimed till as much as a week after the communal mayhem gripped the city in the post-godhra massacre. a number of them were later identified and handed over to the people of the same area. those that were simply not identifiable and had no claimants were disposed off by the authorities after according them the last rites as per their religion ascertained from circumstantial evidence. but presently, the situation is different. doctors say there are also bodies that may or may not be those of the riot-hit. ""in some cases, the police are yet to make a case... in these cases too, the bodies will remain here,"" said another doctor. it needs mention here that ideally the authorities are supposed to dispose off the bodies within seven days but many have been kept for more than two weeks. ""the end decision is in the hands of the police. now suppose that one or two of these people have been attacked to settle personal scores and are being passed off as riot victims. unless the police ascertains the case, the body will not be disposed off,"" said a doctor. then there is this dark angle to the people not coming forward to claim the bodies. ""people know that the dead will be accorded the last rites by the medical authorities. for many of them this is reason enough not to bother themselves in these difficult times,"" concedes a doctor as one of the possibility of people ignoring the dead."	0	0	1	0	0

""my neighbours have given me a second life,"" he says. he has sought transfer to andhra pradesh stating that the atmosphere here is not conducive for people belonging to the minority community. ""gujarat is a prosperous state and indeed a nice place to settle down but the communal riots have completely changed the perception,"" says arshad alam, a senior auditor with the comptroller and auditor-generalaEUR(tm)s ahmedabad office. alam hails from bihar and has gone on a monthaEUR(tm)s leave after riots broke out in the city. he has not ventured out since then and has sought transfer.

"new delhi: the ongoing hindutva-or-power debate in the bjp had its echo at a meeting of its parliamentary wing on tuesday. the prime minister made it clear he had no intention to let this government go as no one else was coming forward to step into the breach. ""we should stay on in the government because we have a responsibility towards the people,"" and not because ""we want to cling to power"", he said. however, in a concession to the hardliners, he said a ""middle path"" which avoided confrontation and allowed the bjp to stay on in power had to be found to resolve the ayodhya issue. this line was earlier taken by home minister advani, who cited the government''s many achievements, including pokhran, and noted that it had already completed four years - more than any other non-congress government despite the many obstacles in its path. party sources said the pm''s remarks came after rajya sabha mp bp singhal (vhp chief ashok singhal''s brother) hit out at the leadership, saying it had lost all credibility with the cadres after the bjp gave up on the temple agitation. worse, it retreated each time the allies made a noise. with only a year-and-a-half remaining of the present term, it would be better to quit power and return to the hindutva agenda. he asked how could the pm entertain the shahi imam of jama masjid who, he alleged, was an isi agent and an admirer of osama bin laden. lal muni chaubey, the mp from buxar, took the other line. as the bjp did not have the numbers, it sought the help of the nda parties to form the government and they came together on the basis of a common agenda which eschewed the ayodhya issue, he said. let us not lose sight of the fact that we came to power on that agenda, he said, adding that going back on that commitment would be tantamount to dhokabaji. the bjp had to accept that for the next 20 years it could rule only through a coalition. the line pm took on tuesday, rss sources stressed, is in sharp variance with its own line - that this government should go, preferably on the ayodhya issue in the next few months. but, bjp sources say, the pm is determined to stay on as it is evident that without the allies the bjp won''t be able to return to power. as the pm himself said, the subject merited a longer discussion. he has asked parliamentary affairs minister pramod mahajan to fix a date for it. but party sources said it wasn''t likely to take place in the near future as the bjp national executive - which will assess the current political situation - is scheduled to meet in goa on april 12, 13, 14. the party leaders would like tempers to cool down before a full-fledged decision.

This story is from March 29, 2002  lucknow: with the joint session on poto over, delhi is learnt to have got down to decide the names of advisors to the up governor. names of 14 retired and serving ias and ips officers have been shortlisted for the final pick. sources said that the central government was all set to send three advisors to assist governor shastri, including one each from the ias and ips cadres along with one from any of the minority communities, preferably a muslim. aEURoethe appointment of the advisors, however, should not be seen as an indication to the tenure of the central rule in the state,aEUR said a source in the state home department adding that it would not be surprising if the advisors'' tenure lasted a couple of months only. while the names of three recently retired ips officers had already figured in the list of 14 approved by the union ministry of home affairs, that of a retired firebrand dgp, who was at the helm of affairs during the ayodhya turmoil under the mulayam singh yadav regime, was scrapped by the prime minister''s office (pmo). the reason stated was his association with the mandir issue during his service. another name that was taken up for serious consideration was that of another up cadre ips who retired from a top rank in the central bureau of investigations (cbi). his candidature too, however, was cancelled by the pmo. while a recently retired dgp of the state and a retired ips officer of the rajasthan cadre were among the favourites in the ips section, on the ias front, the names of a retired bureaucrat who held a senior post in the food and civil supplies department at the centre and that of a former chief secretary of the state and another retired ias, who has had a stint in lucknow, too figured prominently for consideration. other names doing the rounds are those of an ias who recently retired from a senior post in the board of revenue and a up cadre bureaucrat from a minority community who had served in the parliamentary affairs department. sources said that an emissary from delhi was expected to visit the raj bhawan in the next few days for final discussions on the names before the list is announced.	0	0	1	0	0
This story is from March 17, 2002  hyderabad: as the ayodhya drama threatened to spill over to the old city of hyderabad on friday, for once, women stepped out of their households and proved to be a deterrent in preventing violence. they simply formed a human chain, wedging between the namazis and the policemen to vanquish any act subverting peace. more effective than the umpteen platoons posted outside the mecca masjid, about 40 women volunteers of the confederation of voluntary organisations (covo) barricaded the sloganeering youths, forcing them to abide by the peace call. but, despite their peace overtures, stray incidents of violence were reported from the lal darwaja area. three schoolboys had sustained stab injuries in a mob attack. yet, had there been no congregation of the peace-loving in the mecca masjid area, the outcome may have been heart-rending. aEUR~aEUR~we had taken an oath that come what may, we would not allow the human chain to be broken, even if it meant having to suffer stone-pelting,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) said noorjahan, a senior member of the mahila sanatkar, the womenaEUR(tm)s wing of covo. and their resolve did pay off dividend: the human chain lasted half-an-hour, by which time the situation in the charminar area returned to normal. according to noorjahan, the chain was formed by women who belonged to both hindu and muslim communities. aEUR~aEUR~on seeing our resolve and unity, even women who were sitting inside buildings on the roadside came out and joined the chain,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) said a beaming noorjahan. the women peace volunteers had decided early friday morning itself that they would form the chain only if the situation seemed tense. aEUR~aEUR~that is why we waited until the sloganeering started, which usually triggers a clash between the namazis and the police. aEUR~aEUR~our aim was to make sure that the situation did not worsen to such an extent that the police decide to enter the masjid and order a lathi-charge. we are happy that the police did not have to use much force,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says noorjahan. credit also goes to the dcp, (south zone), govind singh, who agreed to the covo plan.	0	0	1	0	1
"This story is from March 19, 2002  ahmedabad: with the state government invoking the essential services maintenance act (esma) to stop college and university staff from going on a flash strike before the crucial final exams, many have said the move was uncalled for. the government had invoked esma on march 13 fearing that the gujarat non-teaching staff federation may stick to its word on striking work just before the forthcoming final exams. with the academic fraternity already under stress because of communal tension, the officials did not want any further trouble from the various unions in the university, sources said. they were also going by the history of the unions, which have generally called an agitation just before exams as it is the best way to arm-twist the government into accepting their demands. one of their main demands has been filling up the many vacancies for both teachers and the administrative staff in the affiliated colleges. ""there was no need to invoke esma especially when we had already informed both the government and the gujarat university of our decision to not to agitate this time,"" says k s shastri. ""they imposed esma on march 13 while we had written to them on march 3. we will have to let them know that there was no need for such harsh measures."" sources, however, added that this was a precautionary measure to ensure that the rest of the exams pass off peacefully."	0	0	0	0	0
"new delhi: prime minister vajpayeeaEUR(tm)s gujarat visit next week may spell the beginning of the end of narendra modiaEUR(tm)s dispensation in the state, say well placed sources in the government. continued violence even after his delhi visit, his defiant demeanour and his shooting from the hip at the media, the opposition and even parliament, have made modiaEUR(tm)s position untenable, these sources point out. though unofficial, the announcement of vajpayeeaEUR(tm)s visit a week in advance has acquired a political significance. the message is that the pm has decided to ignore the pressures from the sangh parivar to retain modi. for starters, the centre may ask governor s s bhandari to send a report on the situation in gujarat to begin belatedly the constitutional process. that this has not been done for over a month, has not been noticed by political observers and constitutional experts familiar with past actions of the union government of the day. for the ruling bjp, which considers gujarat a testing ground for hindutva, the charge of a relation between the gujarat violence and the movement for the ram temple in ayodhya is embarrassing for its long-term plans. that the violence has spread to rural areas, is considered unprecedented and dangerous in official circles. sources in opposition and even in the ruling nda, point out the gross incongruity in the centreaEUR(tm)s constitutional behaviour. that the same party (bjp) dominates the government at the centre and runs the government in gujarat aEUR"" coupled with a senior member of the sangh parivar holding the gubernatorial post aEUR"" has permitted a measure of political sanguinity that has now become the talking point in political circles. for instance, it has been pointed out that even when the congress enjoyed power in centre and states aEUR"" with senior partymen in raj bhavans aEUR"" violence of a political nature, so widespread, ferocious and prolonged, was never permitted. according to durga das basuaEUR(tm)s treatise on the constitution, article 356 was utilised precisely a hundred times till 1997 and since then, another five times. defections, either local or organised from delhi, altered the numbers in legislatures to cause constitutional breakdowns in several cases. but in a majority of the cases, such breakdowns caused law and order situations that needed to be quelled by imposing presidentaEUR(tm)s rule. most recently, when violent disturbances occurred in manipur in protest against the extension of naga ceasefire, the vajpayee government quickly imposed presidentaEUR(tm)s rule. but in contrast, in gujarat, violent riots have been going on for over a month now and reports about the partisan role of the police and state government are legion but the centre doesnaEUR(tm)t seem unduly concerned.
