"This story is from March 9, 2002  vadodara: its citizens say vadodara is truly a cosmopolitan city that recovers as soon as it burns. and now, they are taking pride in the fact that it provided one of the first instances of a city getting back on tracks after violence spread across the state, proving its cosmopolitan nature. having borne the brunt of the post-godhra violence for over a week now, its denizens say that the city has proved the saying that tragedy brings out the best in humanity. the cosmopolitan attitude of people has ensured the spirit of ''quami ekta'' prevails over communal hatred and situational prejudice. facing communal disturbances after a decade, the city seems to only enforce its policy of live and let live. and the phenomenon was evident not just in protected townships like ipcl, ioc, ongc or gsfc, but even in the sensitive areas. rekha rastogi, a bank employee from makarpura, said, ""many people in our area are convinced that the disturbances were caused by outsiders, not people from here. gujaratis are a peace-loving community and cannot possibly cause much harm and damage."" as a result, there is collective sympathy towards those affected by the riots. mrinalaini raman, a resident of sahyog society, helped her maid, from the minority community, by keeping her valuables safe for her. ""she wept as she told me that her electricity and water supply were snapped. then, her home got destroyed. it is our duty to help people in distress,"" she said. maybe so much optimism after chaos seems too good to be true, but city residents as a whole believe that is the time to use minds and start working positively instead of banking on impulsive reactions. said nimita jadeja of ellora park area, ""vadodara will retain its cosmopolitan culture. even if there have been scars on its unified status, they should be taken as a sign of wounds that are healing. soon the pain associated with them too will lessen and things will be normal."" but much also needs to be done to ward off existing prejudice. according to parthiv desai, a teacher residing at karelibaug, ""the sad issue is that children are being hostile to the minority community. i had to explain to them that good and bad people exist everywhere and that need not be based in religion. the solution is that they have to be corrected immediately."""	0	0	0	0	0

new delhi: a group of citizens has requested the chief justice of india to use the supreme court''s inherent powers to intervene in the ongoing mobilisation of temple-building crowds at ayodhya.  the alternative may be a repetition of what took place in 1992, when a similar mobilisation of anti-mosque crowds went totally out of control and the court and the nation were faced with a tragedy that was not supposed to happen, but could have been easily foreseen, notes the appeal.  it has been signed by artist vivan sundaram and academic prabhat patnaik, and journalists nikhil wagel, teesta setalvad and javed anand, and several other eminent persons.  the consequences of inaction and submitting to the threats of bodies like the vhp have been on tragic display over previous days, at godhra, at ahmedabad and elsewhere, it says.  the group has separately asked for dismisal of the gujarat administration and restoration of normalcy to be entrusted to the army, besides the identification and punishment of those responsible for the killings of the past few days.  in a separate meeting, here in delhi on sunday, a group of senior muslim representatives, who included the imam of jama masjid and the head of the jamiat ulema-i-hind, appealed to muslims to maintain unity and to the government to immediately stabilise law and order in gujarat. it also resolved to have a delegation meet the president, the chief justice of india and the chairman of the national human rights commission, in this regard. besides, it has asked for generous compensation to the kin of those killed.  another group of citizens from different religions ^ nirmala deshpande, valson thampu, syeda hamid, etc ^ met prime minister vajpayee to request a number of measures to stop the spreading cycle of violence and despair. they asked for the dismissal of those responsible for allowing the collapse of law and order in gujarat, an immediate and impartial probe into what happened and how and to ban groups creating communal tension in ayodhya. the pm, they said, was polite, but didn''t quite agree with the recommendations.

"This story is from March 2, 2002  the performance of the bharatiya janata party and its allies in three of the four states (in manipur, the party has a nominal presence) was not unexpected but none had thought that it would touch so low. however, the grace with which it has accepted the defeat, even if as part of a strategy, is likely to yield dividends. nevertheless, it might not be able to balk the political cataclysm at the centre. despite having been rebuffed by the bjp for being an aEUR~undependable commodityaEUR(tm), the poll results have exhibited that (1) mayawati is the undisputed leader of the most backwards, (2) defections and splits do not affect her party and (3) single-handed, she is capable of taking on even the best-organised parties. in fact, it is she and she alone who came in way of mulayamaEUR(tm)s dream of an absolute majority. but, more than anybody, she is also responsible for the phenomenon in which instead of casting votes, the people have voted castes. and mulayam singh, by staking claim for power, has almost walked into the aEUR~parlouraEUR(tm), specially prepared by his political adversaries. even if he succeeds in cobbling a wafer thin majority, he would have to do everything he has been attacking the bjp for. the state exchequer being almost empty, from where will he get the money to run the administration and fulfil the promises made by him and his party to the people? besides, the march 15 deadline of the vishwa hindu parishad is quite close and he may have to face a 1990-like situation again. or, may be mulayam has resolved to take on the aEUR~communalaEUR(tm), forces squarely and give an opportunity to other aEURoesecularaEUR parties to either side with him openly or hang themselves. * * * the press under review which had put almost all its eggs into the basket of a particular party and which is naturally jubilant at the defeat of the bjp, will, however, find it difficult to sing praises for the congress or the defection game without which no party, unless two of the major ones join hand, can even present a semblance of a working majority. holding the up elections as an exercise in futility, in dinon (25/2) asserts: now there are only two alternatives, the presidentaEUR(tm)s rule or fresh elections - a very costly affair. the governor has vast powers and he can save the situation at least for six months, adds the daily. highlighting the fact that now the bjp rule has shrunk to four small states of goa, jharkhand, himachal pradesh and gujarat, jadeed amal of the same day argues that since the bjp has fought the elections on the slogan ofaEURvote atal ko, vote kamal koaEUR, its defeat indicates that the prime minister has lost his charisma. the daily however, welcomed the results as in its opinion the people have sagaciously reposed their faith in secularism and have undone the mistake they had committed in the previous election. reacting to the new political scenario in a broader perspective, rashtriya sahara wants the bsp to do nothing which might disappoint its muslim voters who have voted it with the hope that it will not ally with the bjp. it hopes that after the down fall of the bjp, the secular partners of the nda, who are there due to political compulsions, will come to the conclusion that to sail in a wrecked boat will not be a wise move. adeed amal has, in a mild manner, hinted at the limitations of the sp in the number game. aEURoethe congress cannot sail it through aEUR""aEUR"" and so far as the small groups and independents are concerned, the old game of horse - trading may be resorted to again. * * * overshadowing the poll results, the president while opening the budget session has reiterated the governmentaEUR(tm)s resolve to maintain status quo at ayodhya and the stand that any talks with pakistan can be resumed only after it stops backing terrorism in kashmir. in dinon and sahafat (20/2) have hailed the governmentaEUR(tm)s resolve."	0	0	0	0	0
"new delhi: cutting across party lines, opposition parties on tuesday flayed the vhp plan to hold bhoomi pujan at ayodhya ignoring supreme court directive to maintain status quo and accused the gujarat government of letting loose ""state sponsored terrorism"" following the godhra incident. samajwadi party general secretary amar singh said: ""when we visited godhra victims, a kid who was on the fateful train told me, it was the kar sevaks who wreaked havoc in the train by not paying for whatever they consumed all the way through their journey which led to the reaction."" ""though the carnage is in no way justifiable, so is not the state sponsored terrorism that followed the godhra incident. more shameful were the attempts by (chief minister) narendra modi trying to justify the riots as a newton''s third law,"" singh said at a press conference organised by the people for peace & secularism (pps). newton''s third law of motion says that to every action there is equal and opposite reaction. eminent gandhian nirmala deshpande, who is a member of pps, said the new forum is organising a march to the parliament tomorrow to protest the vhp plans for bhoomi pujan. another march on march 15 would be taken to ayodhya. senior congress leader salman khursheed said the party fully supported the march and would participate in it, ""not just in number, but in quality numbers"". singh accused the bjp of ""playing the communal card"" and quoted an unnamed mp of the ruling party as saying that ""the polarisation is complete. we will call for fresh elections and it will be a battle between hindu vote and muslim vote"".

"This story is from March 10, 2002  in 50 years of involvement with law, iaEUR(tm)ve found that a settlement through negotiation is far better than one through litigation. at the end of many litigations, both parties have felt theyaEUR(tm)ve lost. in a settlement, thereaEUR(tm)s a prospect of both feeling theyaEUR(tm)ve won. even the supreme court, in dealing with the issue of the acquired land, asserted that an amicable settlement would be the ideal solution. the shankaracharyaaEUR(tm)s formula is a step in that direction. it is based on the ground situation and the parameters laid down by the sc which classified the acquired land into two categories: the 2.7 acre disputed land, where the mosque stood; and the land whose title was undisputed. these 43 acres are with the ram janmabhoomi nyas and other hindu owners. the sc upheld the government acquisition as a transitional measure, and clarified that the muslims had no claim or objection except to the 2.7 acres. it also stated that, for the time being, the title vests absolutely in the central government, which can consider how much land was required for access to the disputed land by the muslims in the event of their winning the case. who wins and who loses is under judicature. but thereaEUR(tm)s no dispute which canaEUR(tm)t be mutually settled. in this case, the parties are not only those in the allahabad high court case but the whole nation. the demand for a temple is widespread. but the demolition of the mosque has emotively surcharged the situation. it was possible to keep the mosque as it stood and build a temple on the undisputed land. now we have a controversy which is tragic in a country whose civilisation teaches us the cardinal principle of live and let live. i think both communities will be in consonance with their tradition if they accept shankaracharyaaEUR(tm)s formula aEUR"" with such variations as may be necessary. it may be better to appoint an interlocutor who commands the confidence of different communities. the shankaracharya, sri sri ravi shankar and non-partisan individuals can create a climate of reason and reciprocity. and political parties must not make matters worse for votebank calculations. for, national issues can be solved only with a national perspective. shankaracharyaaEUR(tm)s is one way of resolving the impasse. thereaEUR(tm)ll always be detractors but they must be marginalised. the national mainstream today wants a peaceful, sane solution. and its viability will depend on its broad acceptance. the communities must understand that the nation, its harmony, its future is of paramount importance. so let us not stand on rigid positions but come to a solution which makes india win. that the formula found acceptance with important muslim leaders proves its reasonableness. itaEUR(tm)s a practical formula because the disputed land can be kept intact, and if the muslims win the case, the centre can consider whataEUR(tm)s essential for access to the 2.7 acres. the court can be asked to hasten the proceedings. a solution seems in sight as the formula offers a clear ground for an interim solution and has the potential for a long-term one. the formula should not be viewed in a controversial spirit. if the spirit of give and take prevails, the hindus and muslims of india will surely find a solution to live together, in a spirit of fraternity. we cannot have a recurrence of godhra or gujarat. it dehumanises us all and diminishes us as a nation. and the muslims as much as the hindus must understand that they have an overriding duty to the nation they belong to.

This story is from March 11, 2002  vadodara: the closure of about 80 per cent industrial units in panchmahals district in central gujarat in the wake of the train carnage at godhra on february 27 and its aftermath is likely to spell a disaster for the owners of these units. according to bhupendra parikh, vice-president of the forum of industries association & chambers, production and trading have come to a standstill due to the riots which resulted in the blockage of huge amounts of money. talking to tnn on sunday, parikh, who owns an engineering unit near jarod on vadodara-halol highway, said that 80 per cent of the total workforce in about 1,200 units located in the district have gone back to their native places and are too scared to return. he said workers belonging to the minority community are so frightened that they have stopped coming out of their houses, forget reporting to work. even owners of some industrial units have not bothered to inquire about the fate of their units. one reason behind this was the imposition of curfew in these areas. halol, kalol, godhra, lunawada, santrampur and kadana towns were the worst hit in the riots. harish sheth, managing director of kalol-based gujarat setco clutch limited, told tnn that soon after the eruption of violence most workers fled to their native villages bringing production to very low levels. his unit supplies clutches to big names like the tatas and also exports them to the uk and us among other countries. sheth put the production loss at his unit due to large-scale absenteeism at rs 1.25 crore. the thin presence of workers in other units in the district too have affected output. according to former deputy union minister of commerce and former mp from godhra parliamentary constituency shantibhai patel, most industries bore the brunt of the flare-up. both parikh and patel put the production loss in panchmahals district alone at several hundred crores of rupees. several industries located here are major contributors to the country''s export basket, said parikh. the movement of raw material and finished goods was affected due to the disruption of transportation services, said parikh, adding that the non-arrival of raw material will adversely affect production. parikh, however, said that industries could make up for the production loss by working overtime provided the situation becomes normal. if normalcy does not return early it could hit export and domestic orders. the halol-kalol belt, which attracted a large number of industrialists from mumbai and other parts of the country soon after the discovery of crude oil in the ankleshwar oilfields in the 60s, is sensing tough times ahead which could have a deep impact on the economic growth of central gujarat. general motors, abs plastic and safari are some of the well-known companies which have their units in the district. it is feared that several industrialists may be forced to think over the option of shifting their units to safer places like chhatisgarh, hyderabad and bangalore. for the revival of these industries, parikh raised several demands including extension of the time limit by three months for the payment of income-tax and excise duty, raising the limit of letter of credit, banks deferring the recovery of interest amount by two months and extending loans to industries towards payment of employees'' salaries.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 9, 2002  pune: communal murders and tension is not just bad for people, but for business as well.the fallout of the heinous acts in gujarat is being felt by the grape growers of western maharashtra who account for nearly 75 per cent of the nationaEUR(tm)s grape production. the tense situation in ayodhya and other parts of uttar pradesh has also affected truck movement beyond lucknow and towards the north-east. add to that a truckersaEUR(tm) strike called from march 10 midnight, and itaEUR(tm)s not hard to see why itaEUR(tm)s a case of very sour grapes indeed for growers. according to mahagrapes, the city-based farmersaEUR(tm) co-operative, wholesale prices of the fruit have touched an all-time low because of the collapse of the market for grapes in gujarat, coupled with a bumper crop. aEURoein the domestic market, we get the highest price for our best varieties in delhi. however, because of the communal disturbance in gujarat, we had to divert our nextbest varieties from gujarat to delhi. as a result, we have not only lost the gujarat market but prices in the delhi market have crashed,aEUR says prominent grapegrower and executive partner of mahagrapes, balasaheb jagtap. farmers are getting as little as rs 5 per kilo as against rs 12-15 in a normal season. pune, nashik, sangli, solapur and ahmednagar are among the major grape producing districts in maharashtra which accounts for an annual production of over three lakh tonnes. niphad in nashik district alone despatches nearly 125 truck-loads of grapes daily to gujarat. aEURoethey have been forced to cancel these consignments and divert them to other parts of the country, resulting in a crash in prices,aEUR jagtap says. the export market cannot take up the slack. says mahagrapes manager rajan mohadikar, aEURoeless than three per cent of the produce is exported, largely to the uk market.aEUR with grape production being a highly cost-intensive industry, the crash of prices to a two-decade low, is expected, he says.	0	0	0	0	0
"new delhi: the congress is maintaining a studied silence on the ""compromise formula"" put forward by swami jayendra saraswathi, the shankaracharya of kanchipuram, to resolve the ongoing ayodhya tangle. taking the plea that the congress was not a party to this dispute, party spokesperson s jaipal reddy chose not to dwell on the shankaracharya''s proposals. ""there are so many proposals being suggested...we shall comment when this process comes to a conclusion,"" he said in response to persistent queries about tuesday''s fast-paced developments. congress sources said it did not want to sound negative when mediatory efforts were still going on, though it also believed the proposals suggested by the shankaracharya were unlikely to be accepted by the muslim personal law board. the congress'' hands-off approach stems from two counts. several senior party functionaries were involved in parleys conducted by the shankaracharya on tuesday. besides, the shankaracharya is a long-standing friend of the gandhi family and congress president sonia gandhi has called on him in the past, though not in the context of this controversy. in fact, reddy disclosed that the shankaracharya''s office had got in touch with the office of the congress president on monday to convey a message in connection with the latest developments. he also mentioned that the ""congress president holds the shankaracharya in high esteem and thanks him for the courtesy."" the congress believes the matter is sub judice. at the same time, there could be no objections to an amicable settlement between the parties involved. he said their understanding of the 1994 supreme court order was that both the disputed land or the acquired area around it could not be parted with till the title suit was settled.

"ayodhya: unfazed by the supreme court verdict, the vishwa hindu parishad working president ashok singhal has said that the vhp would go ahead with their shila daan and also pujan programme on march 15 at the site ''within'' the ram janmabhoomi complex. holding a joint press conference, the vhp working president and ram janmabhoomi nyas chairman ramchandra paramhans das said that the supreme court order prohibits any puja or activity at the plot nos 159 and 160 in 67 acres of land and they are now free to hold any programme on remaining land within the ram janmabhoomi complex where the apex court order is not applicable. interpreting the court verdict to suit their purposes, both the leaders claimed that the apex court order was not against their march 15 programme as the vhp never planned to hold any programme on plot nos 159 and 160. ""we had announced to hold our programme only on the undisputed land."" even though they showed the map of the rjb complex, they did not clarify which land they would hold their programme. ""the place would be in close proximity of the site where artefacts and other articles are lying within the rjb complex,"" said singhal. after changing its stand almost every day, the vhp on wednesday returned to its original plan saying that there is no difference between shila daan and shila pujan, and that they would now hold both the programmes as scheduled. ""we respect the court verdict and would not hold any programme on plot nos 159 and 160. about 2,000 ram sevaks, including 500 local seers, saints and sadhus would participate in the three-hour-long programme. about 50 vedic scholars from varanasi and ayodhya would conduct the puja ceremony as per vedic rituals,"" disclosed singhal. welcoming the apex court judgment, the vhp has, however, put the ball in the vajpayee governmen''s court saying that it was up to the central government now to allow our programme or arrest us. ""we are contacting the government of india to grant us permission for holding the programme. the decision has to be taken by them now. if disallowed, we would court arrest."" the vhp also appreciated the vajpayee government''s last-distch attempt to seek some relief from the apex court on their march 15 programme. the vhp working president said that the 51-member mandir nirman samiti which is scheduled to hold a meeting on thursday in ayodhya would review the supreme court verdict and take a decision on march 15 as well temple construction plan. he, however, said that the place and time of the meeting was yet to be decided. the vhp also announced that a ram naam jaap would be organised all over the country on march 15 at 2.15 pm. earlier, rjn chairman mahant ramchandra paramhans das said that he would go ahead with his programme to ""donate a carved pillar to the receiver at the makeshift temple after performing puja."" with vhp announcing to go ahead with its plan and the government under pressure from opposition and allies to disallow its programme, a confrontation seems inevitable on march 15. related storiesA govt clamps down on vhp activistsA temporary jails to keep ram bhaktsA vhp finds a loophole, says will still have pujaA nda allies back centre''s standA govt will obey sc order, says pmA govt was not keen on puja: sorabjeeA sc rules out symbolic puja in ayodhyaA nyas to go ahead with shila donationA chronology of eventsA full coverageA A A voice your opinionA text of supreme court ruling    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 9, 2002  kolkata: sixty five-year-old amit de of long island, new york is not just another winter bird of passage, yielding to an annual bout of nostalgia. he is in the city, no doubt, to brush up old friendships and family ties. originally from sonarpur, he went to the land of opportunity in 1974, and set up practice as a certified public accountant. this year he is on a less mundane and more spiritual mission. de is the president of the new york sarbojonin durgotsav committee, which has been organising the puja at franklin square on long island since 1985. a core group of 10-15 families is the prime mover of the puja and de has come here to take back pratimas of durga and her family. in addition, two extra images of laxmi and saraswati are on his shopping list. unlike mail order pratimas shipped out every year by local artisans for pujas abroad, the long island puja committee have set their hearts on something unusual this year. artist nemai pal of kumartulli, commissioned by de, moulded the traditional images first in clay, then cast them in plaster,and finally, crafted them out of fibre glass. for the headgear and ornaments, he used wrought copper from benaras for its durability. the idols range from four to six feet in height and would obviously need special handling in flight when de carries carries them back with him next saturday. what about the puja itself at the big apple? de sounds expectant, even a little wistful. durga puja will be on a weekend again, from friday (october 11) to sunday (october 13). about 400-500 indians, mostly bengalis from queens, south indians and gujaratis gathre for the puja. the priest, pradipta ganguly, is an accountant, too, with a yen for sanskrit mantras. although the sequence of dates followed do not correspond to the panjika (almanac), the rituals would be no different from those of the para pujas here. anjali would be at 1 pm every day followed by the standard kichuri bhog for lunch. immigrant children like their homespun counterparts, have large appetites and from 4-6 pm pizzas and peanut butter sandwiches would have supplemented the pure vegetarian fare. de admits that the younger people among the expats stay away from the pujas and aEURoedo their own thingaEUR.	0	0	0	0	0
"This story is from March 7, 2002  rajkot: union home minister l k advani for the first time in the last five days admitted that the godhra incident was a matter of concern for the central and state governments. talking to reporters here after visiting a small pocket of the riot-torn areas of the city and also after meeting representatives of the bohra samaj and the chamber of commerce, the union home minister said that the godhra incident was a blot on the image of the country. advani said in the last four years wherein the bjp and its allies were in power at the centre, it was a matter of pride for us that there were hardly any communal riots, but the godhra incident has given a bad name to the country. ""it was an horrendous act,"" he added. ""if the killings in godhra were to be condemned, the killing of innocent people in its aftermath was even more condemnable,"" the minister said. he said that after the september 11 wtc attack in the us followed by the december 13 attack on parliament, pakistan was exposed to helping terrorist activities. but, after the meaningless killings in the last five days, even we too have been exposed."" he added that ""immediate steps must be taken to instil confidence in the people"". however, advani denied that the riots had spread due to police inaction. he said ""the cause and reason behind the riots would be found out and analysed"". advani also took a round of the riot-hit areas, where many shops and factories were burnt, and has sought explanation from police commissioner upendra singh in this regard. advani was particularly unhappy at the incident on sunday when a nursing home at paravdi chowk was attacked and burnt down. the owner of the nursing home, dr h b kamdar, told advani that ""it was for the first time that a nursing home was attacked and despite making several calls for help, it did not come"". however, the police commissioner denied any such incident. advani also visited the lati plot where 18 shops of wood were set afire on february 28. the bohra samaj, which was the worst-affected in the riots, also made a separate representation to advani and said that they should be paid compensation. the minister also took a round on the gondal road where a 75-year-old painting shop was set afire by a riotous mob. meanwhile, the chamber of commerce in its representation sought more police force for the city and opening of more police stations in the worst-affected jungleshwar and other areas to protect the industries. the chamber sought immediate assistance from the centre and also adequate police bandobast in future. when asked about the status of the ram mandir issue now that so much of blood has been shed in gujarat, the minister said that ""the stand of the government on ram mandir was very clear. the issue has to be resolved either through an agreement or through court verdict, and every effort is being made to ensure that it is sorted out""."	0	0	1	1	0
This story is from March 12, 2002  hubli: for state bajrang dal convenor pramod muthalik, who is whipping up hindu support in the region for construction of the ram temple in ayodhya, the stand of the bjp on the issue has turned out to be difficult to swallow. muthalik said, ``all those who are opposing temple construction, including vajpayee and advani are anti-hindu''''. he was reacting to prime minister vajpayee''s statement that the government will not allow the activists to go ahead with their plan without hearing the apex courts verdict. has the bjp deceived the sangha parivar on ayodhya issue? muthalik was evasive in his answer. he said, ``all political parties have deceived the majority hindus in the country.'''' but the bjp rode to power banking on ayodhya issue. for this, he said, political compulsions forced the bjp to fall in line with other parties, ``who are all set to appease the minorities.'''' he did not agree to a point that survival of the nda government has become more important than the construction of the ram temple. according to him, bjp national president k. janakrishna murthy has conveyed the party stand to the centre that the undisputed land should be handed over to the ram janmabhoomi nyas. he asserted that neither the court nor the prime minister could stop the bhoomi puja on march 15. he wanted all the temples in the region to perform special pooja on march 15 to coincide with the bhoomi pooja in ayodhya. muthalik said, about 1,500 activists from karnataka and 300 from hubli will participate in the pooja in ayodhya.	0	0	0	0	0
"kolkata: senior bjp leader k r malkani on sunday said there was no inaction on part of gujarat government during the recent communal flare up, and said narendra modi regime has done its utmost to control the situation. comparing the recent riots with those witnessed in the western indian state in 1969, malkani said that the then congress government could not contain the violence for 20 days. ""the modi government tried its best. if you compare the recent riots with those in 1969, you have to admit that the present dispensation in the state had fared much better,"" malkani, a former bjp vice president told newspersons on the sidelines of a convention here. likening the godhra train carnage to the chauri chaura incident in 1921 when a mob had burnt down a police station charring to death several policemen, malkani said the incident then had shocked the entire nation and prompted gandhiji to call off the non-cooperation movement. ""the godhra incident provoked the reaction among the people. however, i feel despite godhra such reaction should not have taken placed,"" he said. brushing aside allegations that the state government and the centre''s ruling coalition had delayed army deployment in the affected areas, he said, ""you cannot deploy the army with a magic wand. there are lot of procedures involved in it"". ""they had lost no time in rushing a large number of police personnel. the military was pressed into service when police failed to contain the violence,"" he said. he also hoped the ayodhya impasse would be resolved amicably. he also charged the congress government of p v narasimha rao with having created a situation which led to the demolition of the babri mosque on december 6, 1992. ""i think that they deliberately created such a situation so as to give a bad name to our party which was in power in uttar pradesh at that time,"" he said. conceding that his party had suffered in the uttar pradesh assembly polls due to the expulsion of former state chief minister kalyan singh, he said ""singh should have acted more responsively and adhered to party discipline"". asked whether it would be proper for his party to install bsp leader mayavati as chief minister, malkani said ""we should start with trust"" he, however, said he was not aware of any discussions between the two parties in this regard. earlier, addressing a convention on ''indo-centric education'', malkani, a bjp ideologue, lambasted the present education system in the country, describing it as one foisted on the people by the british masters. ""this system is sought to be continued by the so-called secular socialists"". making a strong pitch for imparting ''indian education'' to the masses, he quipped ""we are good inspite of our education system. mahatma gandhi, bal gangadhar tilak and g k gokhale would have been greater if they had indian education"". lambasting the critics of the nda governemnt''s education policy, he said there was nothing wrong with ''saffronising the education system''. ""these intellecutals who are criticising us have vested interests. their ranks are dominated by the marxists and madrasahwallahs"", he said. describing the expression ''hindu communalism'' as a contradiction in itself, he said ""a hindu can never be communal. at times some hindus do behave fanatically, but that is a reaction to a more fanatical behaviour from the other side"". further defending the nda government''s proposed changes in the education system, he said ""the history taught so far in the schools present a distorted picture of our great country. such a curriculum was introduced by the british rulers to prevent any growth of nationalistic feelings among indians"". citing the example of china, where medical students were taught chinese medicine in the final year of their course, he asked ""why can''t we have indian medicine in the curriculum of medical education in our country?"" he also flayed the vehement opposition to astrology being regarded as a science, and said ""if meteorology can be called a science, then what''s the problem with astrology? ... those who believe in astrology should be allowed to study the subject if they so wished"". calling the american society a ''ravan''s lanka which has only gold and no love or virtue"", he said ""i am afraid of the influences of american society. i strongly feel that youth below 30 should not be allowed to go to that country"" . in an interesting submission, malkani also claimed that koutilya''s arthashastra was a compulsory study in pakistani military schools.

This story is from March 10, 2002  mumbai:as the gujarat situation went from bad to worse last week, hindu and muslim neighbours in the bit chawls at nagpada began parking their two-wheelers in separate lots. quick to realise what lay ahead, the local mohalla committee called a meeting of the residents and the parking reverted to secular pattern. with the two communities living cheek by jowl in several densely populated clusters in mumbai, it often takes the slightest of reasons to trigger communal tension. in the recent past, all it took for imamwada in central mumbai to come to the brink of a riot was when an old man in a balcony carelessly blew his nose on some youngsters below. in another case, the communal divide in madanpuraaEUR(tm)s afzal chawl came to the fore when water dripped onto some persons from linen left to dry on a second-floor clothesline. the 20-odd active mohalla committees in the city have faced sterner tests over the last year with the the fallout of the bamiyan buddha episode, the arrest of bal thackeray, the banning of simi and the terrorist attacks in new york and new delhi. in all these instances, they managed to nip the trouble in the bud. the acceptability of these panels stems from the fact that they are apolitical and their effectiveness is boosted because of their access to senior police officers. local mohalla committee leaders are often active in social work. for instance, advocate yasmin shaikh runs a free legal aid cell for women at madanpura whereas ajay kaul at yari road, andheri (w), is the principal of a local school and junior college which he started from scratch. however, mohalla committees still have a long way to go. even after ten years, these panels share an uneasy relationship with the police, who resent being questioned by mohalla committee members about cases of high-handedness. for instance, in 1997, the police refused to let the mohalla committee intervene in golibar, santa cruz (e), even when a police atrocity led to a minor riot in the slum. in fact, policemen at the lower level tend to reduce mohalla committees to a network of informants alerting them about communal trouble. in the absence of an effective local leader, as in behrampada, bandra (e), mohalla committees have been subverted by the police. in an especially bad case last year, a member of the midc mohalla committee was attacked by a local goon who ought to have been in police custody. these panels depend heavily on the clout of former police chiefs such as julio ribeiro, satish sahney and r.h. mendonca, trustees of the mohalla committee movement trust. despite these bigwigs, police commissioners such as r.d. tyagi have tried to dilute the effectiveness of these panels by forming parallel mohalla committees packed with members of dubious merit. mohalla committees could have been more effective had they been able to garner the support of civic authorities. however, the civic administration has been unable to convince its field officers to tie up with the committees for solving problems involving, say, water and garbage, that often lead to fights in slums. despite the negatives, it is the grit of dedicated mohalla committee workers and the commitment of retired bureaucrats that has seen the mohalla committees through ten years. their future as an effective organ of civil society now depends on the participation of public-spirited citizens in their activities.	0	1	1	1	0
"ayodhya: the diversion of ayodhya-bound trains started to have an impact on saturday as kar sevaks from west bengal, andhra pradesh and maharashtra failed to reach here. the last batch of about 500 kar sevaks from himachal pradesh and gujarat had arrived here on friday evening, according to vhp office-bearers. the ayodhya railway station, which usually witnesses a lot of hustle bustle and has particularly seen heightened activities during the last one week, wore a deserted look on saturday. vhp''s media officer sharad sharma told pti that the ayodhya-bound kar sevaks had been stopped at sultanpur and other places and the organisers were making arrangements to bring them here. ""we will see what means can be employed to bring them here,"" he said, adding ""they may come down walking as they have tremendous will power."" he said vhp had sent out message to its workers in the neighbouring districts to help the kar sevaks. sharma put the total number of kar sevaks present in ayodhya at 6,000. however, official sources said not less than 20,000 kar sevaks are present in the city. meanwhile, about 1500 kar sevaks from orissa scheduled to leave ayodhya after presenting puranahuti at the ''karsevakpuram'' here were stranded because of non-availability of trains and buses and efforts were being made to send them out, official sources said. the administration had approached the vhp leaders for making arrangements to transport kar sevaks to the nearest places from where they could board trains for their respective places, the sources said. sharma said the kar sevaks would be sent if the government arranges transport as there is total restriction on vehicular movement into and inside ayodhya. the restrictions on train and vehicular movement has apparently started having an impact on the vhp programme as voices have started emanating demanding lifting of these measures. ""government should immediately lift the restrictions. these are causing a lot of hardships to the people of ayodhya,"" convenor of the ram janambhoomi trust ramchandra paramhans said. he said such moves would not have any positive effect on peace efforts.

This story is from March 1, 2002  kolkata: defying prime minister atal behari vajpayee's request, the west bengal unit of the visva hindu parishad is bent on sending its first batch of 'ram sevaks' to ayodhya on friday. in fact, the local vhp has decided to maintain a low profile during the journey to avoid getting identified. kar sevaks will be asked not to shout slogans or exhibit saffron banners to avoid identification by 'attackers'. in the sabarmati express incident, ramsevaks raised slogans and were therefore marked easily, pointed out state vhp organising secretary ratan chakraborty on thursday. the state government, railways and the state bjp leadership seem to have done little to dissuade the vhp. this, despite appeals from the centre to stop movement of vhp supporters, especially in view of the attack on sabarmati express at godhra in gujarat on wednesday. the state government had declared a red alert on wednesday but this may not be enough to stop the ramsevaks from going to ayodhya. for us, the decision of the sant samaj is final. unless they prevent us, ramsevaks will continue to head for ayodhya to attend the purnahuti yagna, said state vhp chief ajoy dey. he claimed that 8,000 ramsevaks from different districts, including kolkata, will leave for ayodhya between march 1 and march 28. the state bjp has also not taken any steps to stabilise the situation as there is no instruction from the central party leadership so far, state party vice president muzaffar khan said. till thursday evening, railway officials had not received any order to stop vhp movement. the centre had asked railways to monitor block reservations to ayodhya. even if there is block reservation, it is difficult to know which group of passengers belong to vhp, argued an eastern railway official. however, er general manager s.c. sengupta held a high-level meeting to review security in ayodhya-bound trains. the vhp will also hold a rally to protest the godhra incident at rani rashmoni road on march 2. however, this time, the leaders admit, that enthusiasm is low. the month-long vhp yagna has been planned to mobilise supporters in ayodhya before they begin shifting the pillars of their proposed ram temple to the babri masjid site. vhp leaders say that the number of zealous ram sevaks have decreased compared to december 1992. in 1990, two brothers from burrabazar, were killed in police firing during the babri demolition.	1	0	1	0	1
This story is from March 6, 2002  kolkata: two of the biggest parties in west bengal, the cpm and the trinamul congress, failed to reach a consensus in condemning the recent violent incidents in gujarat. till late tuesday evening, the two sides could not decide upon the text of a draft resolution that was to be moved in the assembly on wednesday. speaking to tnn in the evening, leader of opposition pankaj banerjee said that the possibility of reaching a consensus was remote. the difference in perception was reportedly on how to condemn the gujarat incident. according to left front chief whip lakshmi dey, the trinamul side suggested an amendment to draft whereby it would like to expunge the reasons behind the presence of karsevaks at godhra station on the fateful day. aEURoewe wanted to condemn sangh parivaraEUR(tm)s call to start ram mandir construction from march 15 which led to the gathering of karsevaks, the incident at godhra and the riots thereafter,aEUR dey pointed out. according to dey, one has to reach a root cause of a problem before taking a stand. the feeling on the treasury bench side is that it was not possible for the trinamul, that has stood by the prime minister on the gujarat issue, to condemn the reasons behind the gathering of the karsevaks as it would go against bjpaEUR(tm)s line.the trinamul side, however, feels that more than a genuine condemnation of the incident, the left front is more keen on appeasing muslims. that is why the resolution was ambiguous in pinpointing the miscreants at godhra, they say. aEURoewe have told the left front chief whip that even left front chairman biman basu has publicly condemned the incident at godhra railway station. why cant the left front do the same,aEUR asked opposition whip sobhandeb chattopadhyay. however, most parties are united in demanding dismissal of gujarat chief minister narendra modi and handing over of the stateaEUR(tm)s law and order machinery to the army. cpm politburo member sitaram yechuri said in kolkata on wednesday the opposition would corner the treasury benches on the issue when parliament opened on wednesday after a two-day adjournment. aEURoewe are not specifying which article or act the government has to invoke in riot-ravaged gujarat. but the situation is extremely grave and progressively spinning out of control. it has to be stopped at any cost. given the state police forceaEUR(tm)s partisan action, only the army can restore normality,aEUR yechuri said on tuesday. though he mentioned both article 355 of the constitution and the armed forces special power act as possible ways of intervention, but did not narrow down on one. while the former allows centreaEUR(tm)s intervention for restoration of law and order in a state, that latter allows the army to gauge the situation and deploy forces independent of directions from the state government. referring to the cpmaEUR(tm)s ideological opposition to article 356, yechuri emphasised that the situation in gujarat warranted the army to be in control. aEURoethe situation in gujarat is extremely grave and fast attaining a proportion that is worse than even the mumbai riots in 1992,aEUR he said. while violence has been contained in urban gujarat and cities like ahmedabad, surat, baroda are now under control, it was spreading like wildfire in the districts and villages. yechuri, samajwadi party general secretary amar singh, rajya sabha mp shabana azmi and raj babbar visited the strife-torn state last week but were refused security to tour the cities. aEURoegeorge fernandesaEUR(tm) motorcade was stoned. when even the defence minister is vulnerable and points to lapses on the part of the state including a delayed deployment of the army, how can the chief minister continue in office? thereaEUR(tm)s the added fear of the violence spreading to other states if it is not contained soon,aEUR he said. yechuri was speaking to newspersons after a post-budget discussion. convenor of the economic affairs committee of bjp, jagdish shettigar, who was also present at the discussion, fumbled in his defence of modi. aEURoewe become emotional and played right into the hands of our pakistanaEUR(tm)s inter services intelligence. though the isiaEUR(tm)s direct link has not been proved yet, we know itaEUR(tm)s a conspiracy to destabilise the nation,aEUR he said. gujarat has been extensively discussed at the national security advisory board of the government. though yechuri and shettigar differed on the fate of modi, both admitted that indian polity had failed to bring the two communities together. aEURoeof course, itaEUR(tm)s a failure on the part of political parties and their policies. the gujarat eposide is a gory pointer to the religious polarity and ethnic diversity of our people and how a lack of mutual respect can threaten the countryaEUR(tm)s integrity,aEUR yechuri added.	0	0	1	1	0

This story is from March 10, 2002  mumbai: their limbs may be broken but theyaEUR(tm)re a determined band. one a paraplegic, another a polio victim, yet another an amputee. coming together under the banner of aEUR~apang senaaEUR(tm), this group of 150 disabled persons from navi mumbai is confronting the current communal crisis in a unique way. they have pledged that all the telephone booths manned by the handicapped will intervene in situations if people try to instigate others, will protect victims should the occasion arise, and will use their network to verify and scotch rumours as soon as possible. they will sit at vashi station in their special vehicles carrying peace posters on sunday. aEURoewe are proud that in 1992-aEUR(tm)93 when bombay went up in flames, not a single shop was looted in navi mumbai nor a single person killed, though people of all communities live here,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says pushparaj shetty, a polio victim and an activist with apang sena. in case thereaEUR(tm)s trouble we are determined to keep our neighbourhood safe again. we have started making posters which will be put up at our telephone booths and will also bring out a pamphlet on safety measures which will be circulated through the network of our booths. people think the handicapped are weak and pity us but we want to show that we can also do something for society.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) disabled persons in navi mumbai felt the need to unionise as they all faced problems regularising the telephone booths they had been allotted. aEURoepublic call booths are allotted so close to one another that business gets spread thin,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) explains pushparaj. aEURoemoreover booths are shifted around at the whims of corporators. no one can survive on an std line alone. if we try to supplement our income by selling cold drinks, biscuits or toiletries, we have to first get municipal permission. this means dealing with mtnl, the municipality and cidco. with the cidco office being located at belapur, our members find it very difficult to go up and down, as for some, the only means of transport is a handoperated cycle.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) today apang sena members include the blind, deaf and dumb along with the physically handicapped. some are studying, some employed. not all run telephone booths.as their membership grew they formed the apang cooperative society and applied for housing quarters under the handicapped quota but since they have been allotted land at the impractical location of khargar, six stations away from vashi, their efforts are yet to materialise. kutubbuddin rasool ansari, an active member of apang sena has been paraplegic from i987 when he was injured in police firing during communal riots that erupted after the reliance cup cricket match. after nine years at the sharan paraplegic foundation where he learnt tailoring and cycle repairs he is economically self-reliant but tends to catch infections easily and is under regular treatment at g.t.hospital. aEURoehave you seen the photographs of bandaged children in the newspapers?aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he asks, referring to the recent carnage at gujarat. aEURoewith every riot, the handicapped population increases. we who have suffered will do everything to prevent this. handicapped people have no caste, no community. being handicapped is the common bond.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) only one other member of apang sena is a riot victim, most of the others were handicapped after accidents. but they are vocal and unanimous in criticising communal violence.aEURoewhat happened at godhra was bad, but what happened in gujarat afterwards is worse,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says ankosh deogarh, who worked as a mechanic at sewree before he lost his legs in a train accident. aEURoesuch riots set the country back by ten years. it takes years to start a business, make a life, but minutes to destroy it. whoever kills in the name of religion is neither hindu nor muslim but shaitan ke aulaad.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) strong words, but the faces around him nod in assent. aEURoei am not a secularist but a hindu. ram is born in our hearts every day,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says shetty who shaved off his beard in 1993 after being accosted by a mob who had burnt alive a man aEURoelike a tandoori chickenaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) in front of him. aEURoetwenty years ago we hadnaEUR(tm)t heard of babri masjid or ayodhya. tell leaders to forget mandir-masjid and build a monument to the people who have died. tell them the handicapped people of navi mumbai will donate all our std booths to them if only they let the country live in peace.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm)	0	0	1	0	1

This story is from March 11, 2002  kolkata: besides khadim vice-chairman partha roy bur-man, other businessmen of the city, too, were in the list of targets for abduction drawn up by the dubai-based aftab ansari. during interrogations by cid officials, he revealed that he was just waiting for the opportune moment to strike again. after the abduction of roy burman, aftab ansari called up from dubai several top and middle-rung businessmen of kolkata de-manding hefty ransom. this was the candid confession made by aftab to the officers of state criminal investigation department on monday, a day after he was brought to kolkata from rajkot. a cid source said, threatening over the telephone was not exactly his style of action. in such cases, the amount extracted from the victim was far less than what was demanded. but after the high-profile abduction of roy burman, asif reza khan, the key abduc-tor and aftabaEUR(tm)s operational head in india, who was later killed in gujarat in an encounter, insisted that aftabaEUR(tm)s call would pay rich dividend. cid officers said that like roy burman, the businessmen in his list were well chosen after a lot of researching on them. but ar-rests of his men following the abduction and the release upset his plan to a great extent. aftab looked run down after spending over a month in the custody of different agencies. but during the interrogation he remained uncannily calm and relaxed. aEURoebut so far, he has not revealed any-thing which is completely new to us,aEUR a cid officer said. cid officers are suspicious about aftabaEUR(tm)s apparent aEURoeco-operativeaEUR approach. earlier, the cid interrogated asif, who also showed a great deal of co-operation. he was taken to park circus, where aftabaEUR(tm)s men built a den for keeping in touch with aftab in dubai. yet asif managed to reveal almost nothing about jamaluddin nasser, another key aftab-man and his house in tiljala. nasser at that time sat pretty in his tiljala house.	0	1	1	0	0
"ayodhya: as the tussle over the ownership of the disputed land in ayodhya continues with full vigour, a frail octagenarian sadhu, unmindful of it, is completely engrossed in his most important task - to take care of a pile of bricks.       read this story in...          A A hindi    after all, these three lakh bricks are not ordinary. with shri ram inscribed on them, the bricks are the ones proposed to be used for the seat of an idol of lord ram planned to be built by vhp at the disputed site here. ""it is not any recent assignment of mine. i have been performing this task for the last 13-odd years,"" remarks chaitanya maharaj sitting on a bed in his small room in the vhp''s office, barely 200 metres from the disputed site. ""taking care of these bricks and to ensure no damage is done to these is of utmost important to me as they represent the sentiments of crores of people in india,"" adds chaitanya maharaj, who appears to be weary but does not fail in his task of preserving the bricks. the bricks have been ''donated'' by three lakh villages from across the country after a call by the vhp, and have been lying in the courtyard since 1989. special yajnas were performed in each village and bricks prepared especially for the purpose of contribution towards construction of the ram temple. ""proper pujas have been performed on these bricks in each village, demonstrating the immense religious sentiments"", he says. these include the ones even sent by followers from abroad, including the uk, the us, japan, the netherlands and canada. ""countries do not matter when it comes to aastha (sentiments),"" chaitanya maharaj comments. the bricks, having various shapes and size, looking like an ordinary pile in the form of a wall, also have the words shri ram written on them in at least 12 languages. a sum of rs eight lakh, has also been collected through donations for the construction of the temple. ""interest accrued on the sum is used for the maintenance of the vhp office here,"" the sadhu said. with two attendents at his service, chaitanya maharaj does not fail to have a look at the bricks on a daily basis and ensure these are cleaned every week to preserve their shine. however, about 200 bricks have been broken by monkeys which roam about freely in his compound, he said. ask him about when he thinks these will be brought into use, he says, ""there is no worry as these will be preserved for quite some time and used whenever the issue is resolved.""

"ahmedabad: rising steadily, the toll in the communal violence, that broke out in gujarat eight days ago, now stands at 667, including the 62 persons who died in the attack on the sabarmati express on february 27. two persons were stabbed in ahmedabad on thursday one of whom later succumbed to injuries, showing that the violence which entered its second week was still far from over. the stabbings took place on relief road, one of the busiest market places of the city. official sources said the death toll in the attack on the train at godhra had risen from 58 to 62 with the death of four persons who were seriously injured in the attack which sparked off widespread reprisals across the state. figures available at the police control room in the state capital state that 820 persons with serious injuries were still admitted to various hospitals, many of them in a critical condition. almost 157 of the deaths have taken place in stabbings and the rest have succumbed to burn injuries and gun- shots. ten bodies were recovered from a village well at ajanwaga in godhra district on wednesday. the victims were reportedly taking shelter in a primary school when they were surrounded by a mob and thrown into the well. official statistics say that 99 persons have been killed in police firing. the security forces have fired 5,176 rounds of ammunition on mobs as well as 7,276 teargas shells. as many as 2,459 houses, 2,082 shops, 1,084 cabins and 448 vehicles, including 12 buses, have been set on fire. additional chief secretary ashok narain said: ""the toll is going to be higher because more bodies are being found."" at the same time, the situation is largely quiet in gujarat over the last two days, but for stray incidents of violence in ahmedabad and other parts of central gujarat. in the chota udepur area of vadodara district, where a policeman who was escorting some families to safety was shot by his own rifle by a mob on tuesday, the situation is said to be still very tense. a spokesman for the army''s corps of electrical and mechanical engineers (eme), which is deployed in vadodara, said one column of the army was sent to chota udepur on thursday evening to control the situation on the request of the state government. the sudden spurt in the death toll from 544 to 607 between wednesday and thursday is the result of many more bodies having been found in godhra and the count being revised in ahmedabad. official figures suggest that in ahmedabad, as many as 28 more deaths have been added to the tally during the 24 hours, taking the total death toll in the communal flare- up in the city alone from 243 to 271. but there was no official explanation available for this upward revision. in godhra, the figure was up from 59 dead on wednesday to 69 on thursday. this excludes the 58 dead in the train burning incident. in sabarkantha, the figure of those dead has gone up from 30 to 34. well-placed sources said bodies in isolated rural areas still remain to be searched.

"new delhi: the union government cannot please any organisation like the vishwa hindu parishad by gifting it the acquired 67 acres of land adjacent to the demolished babri masjid in ayodhya, according to the supreme court''s 1994 ruling. it stated that the acquisition must be for the ""larger national purpose of maintaining and promoting communal harmony and in consonance with the creed of secularism"". the handing over of even ""undisputed"" portions of the land to any one community prior to the settlement of the title to the disputed portion would presumably not be in ""consonance with the creed of secularism"" which prohibits preferential treatment towards any one religion. while upholding the acquisition of certain areas act, 1993, and refusing to answer the presidential reference on the mosque-temple dispute, a constitution bench by a 3:2 majority stated: ""the acquisition has affected the rights of both the communities and not merely those belonging to the muslim community"". holding that it was difficult to visualise that certain provisions of the act were ""a slant in favour of the hindu community"", the then chief justice, m n venkatachaliah, now head of the constitution review panel, justice j s verma, who is now chairman of the national human rights commission, and justice g n ray had ordered the status quo as on january 7, 1993, to be maintained. the sc said the union government would be a statutory ""receiver"" of the disputed properties and could only hand over possession in accordance with the courts'' decisions. it, however, explained that the statutory freeze ""does not curtail"" the muslims'' right to offer namaz there but ""reduces the hindus'' right to offer prayers"" at the site of the demolished mosque. the minority judgment delivered by the then justice a m ahmadi and justice s p bharucha, had said the act was ""offensive to the principle of secularism, being slanted in favour of one religious community against another"". since the state has no religion, it must not advance the cause of one religion to the detriment of the other, they said, adding: ""secularism is absolute. the state should not treat religions differently on the ground that public order requires it"".

""religion is important, but it should be personal. my relationship with god is my business and no one else''s,"" he says. nid students have been whiling their time away with nothing to do due to shortage of materials. they haven''t been allowed to venture outside since the riots began and have no idea about the prevailing situation in the city, except for what they have read in the newspapers and seen on television. vandana kena and pallavi zambre from maharashtra had left their homes on the day the riots started. they reached ahmedabad without an inkling of the disaster taking place. they had no transportation to take them to the cept campus, where they study. they literally had to plead a bus driver to take them to their hostel. kena says, ""we''ve been eating just noodles for the last few days. and since there are no phones here, we have not been able to call even our parents."" kunal thakkar, an outgoing media committee member from iim, has been climbing onto his dorm terrace and seeing the smoke billowing out from various parts of the city. he feels really sad at the scenes around him. ""i''ll be leaving this city in a few weeks and i feel really distressed on seeing incidents of this nature happening to such a vibrant city,"" says thakkar. most of these students have seen such wanton destruction for the first time in their lives and are aghast at the way the people have turned on each other. the only assurance of personal safety comes from safe havens of the premises of the institutions or the hostels they live in."	0	0	0	0	0

"This story is from March 7, 2002  gandhinagar: the gujarat government is unlikely to send back the army and other para-military forces, called to assist the police in the riot-torn state, till march 22. the decision has been taken with a view to provide security to above 6,000 haj pilgrims, who would start arriving from saudi arabia from march 15 onwards. ""the armed forces will have to remain in the state at least for a week after the hajis reach the state - the time taken for them to reach their native places,"" an official said. in fact, official sources revealed that the state home department has requisitioned five extra companies of the rapid action force to maintain peace in the immediate future. this apart, orders have been issued to tighten the security noose for a week after march 15 at important spots where the pilgrims will arrive, such as the ahmedabad airport. the police has been told not to allow entry to more than the specified number of people into the airport premises and also to escort the pilgrims if they have to go to far off places. currently, the state has 18 companies of army, each with a strength of about 100 personnel, eight companies of border security force, six companies of the central industrial security force and four companies of raf. ""the state has preferred to get more raf because it has been found to be more effective in dealing with the rioters,"" a senior bureaucrat said. the safe return of the hajis to their residents is considered here as an acid test for the state government''s claim that normalcy has returned to gujarat. meanwhile, it is officially learnt that the gujarat government will send its report on the communal incidents to the national human rights commission early next week. ""the state had asked for two weeks'' time for it, but has not got it so far,"" an official said. ""the report is under preparation. it carries replies to nhrc''s suo motu queries based on newspaper clippings. the state does not want to take much time. it will be sending the report soon."" moves are also afoot in the corridors of power to find out about the police inaction during the first two days of riots and as to why did the para-military forces arrive late. there is also considerable concern among official circles on the failure of the police to bring to book those belonging to the sangh parivar, even when firs have been filed against them. ""suitable action will be taken at appropriate time for continued indifference,"" said a senior official."	0	0	1	1	0
new delhi: unidentified men attacked and set fire to one of the coaches of the sabarmati express at godhra station in the morning of february 27. it is still not known what prompted the attack, but 58 kar sevaks who were returning from ayodhya were killed in the incident. later, the same train was attacked again at vadodara and two persons were stabbed to death when alleged vhp activists attacked it in retaliation. five more stabbing incidents were reported in gujarat later in the evening. as violence spread, the government swung into action and home minister l k advani asked the uttar pradesh government to stop kar sevaks from entering ayodhya. by nightfall, riots started in ahmedabad. while six people were injured in police firing, 12 people were killed by the rioters. that took the toll to 70 by wednesday night. vhp, meanwhile, accused the government of communal negligence in gujarat. on february 28 morning, advani told parliament that all states had been put on alert following the gujarat riots. amid violence, the cabinet committee on security met and decided to send in the army to douse the gujarat fire. the prime minister requested the rss to broker peace with the vhp and assured the sangh outfits of government support in finding a speedy solution to the ayodhya problem. muslim leaders, including the imam of jama masjid, met the prime minister to seek a dismissal of the narendra modi government. congress chief sonia gandhi too made a similar demand. through thursday, riots continued all over gujarat. thursday night saw unprecedented violence when about 150 people, including one former mp, were killed by rioters. by friday morning, the death toll had touched the 200 mark and 37 cities in the state were under curfew. army troops, who reached the state from delhi, were deployed in three cities, including ahmedabad. normal life has been disrupted in many parts of the state. meanwhile, the nationwide bandh called by the vhp evoked a mixed response. while violence was reported from aligarh, hyderabad and rajasthan. ayodhya, however, remained peaceful under a security blanket. on friday, an all-party meet was convened in the capital where a joint statement was made appealing for peace and harmony in gujarat. the meet was attended by the prime minister, l k advani, opposition leader sonia gandhi and mayawati among others. defence minister george fernandes visited the riot-hit areas and took stock of the situation. reports said he hauled up the state government over its handling of the situation. the violence continued on friday night with 27 people being burnt to death in sardarpura village in mehsana district. by saturday morning peace was returning to ahmedabad, the worst-hit city, but violence was spreading to hitherto unaffected areas. a group of mps who tried to visit the riot-hit areas were denied permission to do so by the state police and had to return to new delhi. police said the mps were denied permission as it was not safe for them to visit the riot-hit areas yet. curfew was clamped for the first time in thirty years in gandhinagar and also in surat. incidents of violence and killing were reported from bhavnagar and vadodara. the total death toll had hit the 350 mark by saturday afternoon. the prime minister called the violence a disgrace to the nation in an address to the nation on doordarshan on saturday afternoon and appealed for calm and communal harmony. meanwhile, president of the ram temple trust, ramchandra paramhans said there was no question of going back on the issue of construction of the ram temple in ayodhya.

This story is from March 7, 2002  rajkot: it would seem that the state police has failed to learn from past mistakes, with the result that the state keeps witnessing communal killings at regular intervals. a senior police officer here maintained that the incident at godhra was one such clear cut case mistake where the police failed to move in a timely manner and avert not only the incident at godhra but also the resultant flare up. or was it also a case of intelligence failure on part of the police force? the officer, wishing anonymity, maintained that during the 1992 babri masjid demolition and the period before that, riots had broken out at palej railway station near vadodara when the ram sevaks had provoked the local population. similar incidents were also reported from dahod soon after the babri masjid demolition. this time also, when the state police knew that there was large scale movement of ram sevaks to ayodhya, the state police could have acted fast and asked the dsps in all the areas, through which the ram sevaks would be travelling, to be on high alert. mostly, majority of the ram sevaks move from gujarat and maharashtra to ayodhya, whenever such a call is given by the vhp or the bajrang dal. the local dsps could have been asked to be more alert to any such untoward movement or unusual gathering of mobs . this is a usually well followed guideline in the police force, as gujarat is a communally sensitive spot and even a spark could turn into an inferno. according to the police officer, things had started hotting up as early as january, when the ram sevaks had started moving to ayodhya and their movement was much publicised. this should have sent alarm bells ringing in the ears of senior police officers and the director general of police. the officer also maintained that if the state intelligence bureau could keep the chief minister''s office informed of his political future in rajkot-2, they could have also done so with regards to such mass movement of ram sevaks and the possible fallout of such movement. even if one presumes that the intelligence bureau did warn the state government, it failed to pass on the message to the ranks below and it certainly did not reach the panchmahal dsp raju bhargav and if it did, then he was lax on acting on the alert or was he thought that things would pass off peacefully. well, whatever is the truth, a judicial probe in to the matter would possibly bring out the truth!	0	0	1	1	0
This story is from March 3, 2002  hyderabad: the all india babri masjid action committee (aimac) has accused the bjp of masterminding the ongoing communal riots in various parts of the country to pave the way for the transfer of disputed land in ayodhya to the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp). aimac convener zafaryab jeelani told reporters on saturday that the riots were planned about two months ago by the bjp-led central government. aEURoeat the end of the vhpaEUR(tm)s chetavni yatra from ayodhya to delhi on jan. 27, prime minister atal behari vajpayee had announced that the vhpaEUR(tm)s demand of transferring the disputed land has been referred to law minister arun jaitley. subsequently, the vhp leaders announced that they would start construction of a ram temple from march 15,aEUR he said. jeelani said all those statements were made by the bjp and vhp leaders to polarise the voters during the assembly elections in uttar pradesh and other states. having lost the elections in all four states, the bjp then decided to transfer the disputed land by aEURoepressuring itselfaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) through the communal violence unleashed by the vhp. aEURoevajpayee may now enter into a secret deal with the vhp for transferring the disputed land to buy peace in the country,aEUR jeelani said, adding that such a deal would be a blatant violation of the supreme court orders. he requested that everybody should respect the courtaEUR(tm)s verdict he said the muslims and the secular forces in the country would never accept any such plan and they would resist all such moves. the shahi imam of the jama masjid of bihar, quari aqlaqi quasmi, was also present on the occasion.	0	0	0	0	0

new delhi: a full-fledged puja involving kar sevaks and part-construction of a proposed temple on the `undisputed'' area in ayodhya on march 15 is going to present a security nightmare and hence cannot be allowed, say government sources here. among the security issues is the concern about separating the undisputed and the disputed area, to prevent any infringement into the disputed area. second, will be the issue to stopping construction once it is allowed to start, given the fact that thousands are expected to congregate at ayodhya on march 15. the proposal of the kanchi shankaracharya sri jayendra saraswati that a wall should be constructed between the disputed and undisputed areas will be unworkable if hooliganism sets in, says a senior home ministry official. throwing a security cordon around the disputed site will also be fraught with risk given the complicity of security forces under such conditions in the past. a security cordon had been thrown around the babri masjid in 1992 that was of no avail. the police in gujarat in the recent communal carnage, have also been accused of being hand-in-glove with the rioters. there are reports that suggest that the vhp has been presented with a fait accompli that the government can at the most give in to a `symbolic'' puja to be conducted by a limited accumulation of religious leaders. no construction will be allowed and kar sevaks will not be allowed close to the site. prime minister atal bihari vajpayee was closeted late thursday night with the kachi seer, bjp president jana krishnamurthy, vhp chief ashok singhal, rss joint secretary madan das devi, defence minister george fernandes and home minister l k advani, to work out a solution to the march 15 deadline set by the vhp, that is going to keep both the parties happy. at a press interaction thursday, vhp president ashok singhl said a plan to shift carved stones to the undisputed land and the shila pujan remained unchanged. the puja, he said, ``will be performed in a peaceful, cheerful, joyous and blessed atmosphere.'''' ``but given the past record of the vhp, nothing can be taken for certain,'''' says an official. with the imposition of president''s rule in uttar pradesh, it will now be the direct responsibility of the centre to ensure that the construction as well as the puja goes off peacefully, if it is allowed to take place, say officials. the last thing the union government will want is matters going out of hand and march 15 turning out to be another law and order problem, after gujarat. related storiesA we will abide by court verdict: vhpA vhp will not be part of ayodhya talksA vhp commitment positive: muslim law boardA read edit: major priorities    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail	0	0	1	1	0

"new delhi: minister of state for home i d swami on saturday admitted that the intelligence machinery in gujarat had failed to provide prior information about the godhra incident but categorically rejected opposition charge of a deliberate delay in the deployment of army in the riot-torn areas.       read this story in...          A A hindi    ''''it is a failure of the state cid and intelligence and those people should have known it. we will certainly go ahead with the inquiry and a judicial inquiry has been ordered. after godhra there was no failure on the state government''s part,"" swami told a panel discussion on a private tv channel. during the charged discussion in which sanjay nirupam (shiv sena), kapil sibal (congress) and nominated mp shabana azmi participated, swami said it takes time for the state administration to come to grips with the situation of such a magnitude and no state government has enough forces. the minister termed as ''''wrong'''' the opposition charge that there was deliberate delay in moving the army in. stating that involvement of pakistan''s inter services intelligence (isi) in the godhra massacre could not be ruled out, swami said although the government did not have conclusive evidence, it had leads indicating the isi could be behind the carnage in a bid to portray india the same way pakistan has been, as a fundamentalist country before the world. nirupam, whose party is an nda partner, countered swami saying the home ministry sought to blame isi for any major criminal event. ''''it is a shame on us. what is the government doing to contain such activities?'''' he asked. nirupam described the continuing ayodhya imbroglio as a root cause for communal incidents and demanded that the government should plead to the courts for an quick and final settlement of the dispute. maintaining that the jayalalitha cases were settled by the judiciary in a short span, he accused the government of not being serious in resolving the ayodhya issue. he also sought a white paper on isi activities. swami intervened to say that the government was working on a white paper by excluding certain information which could hamper investigations. he also said home minister l k advani would have referred to possible isi involvement if he had made a statement on the gujarat situation in parliament on friday. observing that this was not the time to indulge in a blame game, sibal that the situation demanded quick responses from the authorities and political parties to contain the communal flare-up and help the affected people. he also sought introspection on the part of the government and parties to prevent recurrence of such incidents.

""for that, one has to prove that those involved have been party to organised terror. but i see nothing wrong in lifting the poto"", he clarified. ""different ipc sections, including the ones applied on those responsible for mass killings, are strong enough to book those responsible. conviction will be as good as poto."" sources further said pressure from several quarters was indeed quite strong on the cm to withdraw poto. the national human rights commission, which was here on a three-day visit, had also raised serious objections to it. circles close to the cm, however, take a different view. according to them, the decision to apply poto was that of the investigating officers. the decision to make poto effective in gujarat was taken on march 1, 36 hours after the gruesome tragedy had taken place. ""poto is not like tada or pasa, where preventive arrests can be made. its provisions are far more stringent"", informed a top bureaucrat. he added, ""it not only requires an area to be notified before hand as terrorist-prone, it also requires to set up special courts to try the poto accused""."	0	1	1	0	0

new delhi: expressing his personal anguish at the communal violence in gujarat -- and his frustration, as head of state, at the failure of the narendra modi and vajpayee governments to protect the lives of innocent citizens -- president k r narayanan declared on thursday that he would not be celebrating holi this year. ''at this moment when communal disturbances are taking place in parts of our country, it is important that we summon our traditional spirit of tolerance in order to establish peace and harmony among our people, he said in a message on the eve of holi. linking holi with communal harmony, narayanan observed that the festival of colours is symbolic of the multi-religious harmony that has existed in the country for centuries and the spirit of toleration that has been the essence of country's culture and civilisation. apart from not celebrating holi this year, narayanan declared he would also not receive any visitor on the day. if the earlier announcements by prime minister vajpayee and home minister l k advani that they would not celebrate holi had a somewhat hollow ring given their own political culpability for failing to rein in a partisan chief minister, the president's declaration is tantamount to a moral vote of no confidence in the two leaders. (congress president sonia gandhi also decided not to celebrate holi.) narayanan's message takes on special significance against the backdrop of warnings by citizens' groups in gujarat that sangh parivar activists are planning fresh attacks on the state's beleaguered muslim community. according reports lakhs of copies of an inflammatory and seditious pamphlet are being distributed in ahmedabad calling upon saffron extremists to indulge in more violence during holi. openly inciting attacks on muslims, the anonymous pamphlet says, ''police and army you also beware, you are also hindus...you should also support hindus.'' as on past occasions, president narayanan has not minced his words when it comes to taking a stand against violence. his message does seem to be in consonance with the mood of most citizens -- who cannot understand how the riots and violence in gujarat have persisted for as long as a month. related stories  Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 25, 2002  bangalore: former prime minister and mp h.d. deve gowda on sunday lambasted the centre for failing to control violence in gujarat after godhra incident and its insistence on bringing in the draconian prevention of terrorism ordinance. speaking to reporters here, gowda said: ``the bjp is trying to inject poison into the mind of the common man by raking up the temple issue because it wants to gloss over its failure in administration. nothing less than an investigation by a sitting supreme court judge with the help of the cbi will suffice.'''' denying he had any intention of destabilising the nda government, gowda however stated that he could not keep quiet when the bjp was trying to pursue a selfish agenda. ``my intention is to maintain peace and harmony,'''' he said. terming the rss and the vhp as `blind fanatics,'' gowda said he had no need to learn from them about the worship of rama. ``the country needs `roti,'' employment, drinking water and poverty alleviation more than a ram temple. we have no objections for building a temple or a mosque, but we cannot tolerate killing of innocent people,'''' he maintained. referring to the gujarat government''s move to book 57 persons arrested during the godhra violence under poto, who were subsequently booked under another section after poto failed to go through the rajya sabha, gowda said: ``it is evident how this draconian law can be misused. it can be used to victimise political opponents.'''' he felt poto was worse than emergency. `it cannot solve the problems in the country,'''' he contended. gowda announced that he would tour gujarat next month. ``i was scheduled to visit the state this weekend but the district administration urged me to cancel it due to fresh outbreak of violence. but i am determined to visit the violence torn areas,'''' he added. asked about his party''s support to business tycoon vijay mallya in the march 27 rajya sabha elections, gowda said: ``senior leader ramakrishna hegde proposed his name and i have respected his choice. i did not go against it because i might be accused of hindering the merger process between my party and jd(u).''''	0	1	1	0	0
This story is from March 15, 2002  danapur: acting secretary of the emarat-e-shariah of phulwarisharif sohail ahmad nadvi appealed to the people, particularly muslims of the state, to maintain communal peace and social amity in the wake of the apex court verdict on ayodhya where any kind of puja on disputed land is banned now. according to nadvi, since presidentaEUR(tm)s rule has been imposed in uttar pradesh, it is the moral responsibility of the centre to protect the life and property of each muslim as well as maintain status quo at the disputed site. he admitted that vested interests are out to create trouble in the country, but those muslims who are innocent, should not be harassed or taken to be isi agents. he, however, said that those who are culprits, must be brought to book. not happy with the union governmentaEUR(tm)s attitude towards muslims in the country, nadvi asked muslims to defend themselves in any emergency instead of depending on the government forces.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 20, 2002  ahmedabad: in a move which is bound to evoke security concerns all over india, the vishwa hindu parishad is finalising a countrywide programme wherein ashes of victims of the godhra train massacre will be taken to 750 different places all over the country. however, gujarat will be left out of this programme for the time being. the joint general secretary of vhp in gujarat, jaideep patel said the aEUR~asthi yatrasaEUR(tm) containing ashes of the godhra victims in urns will be taken out in the coming weeks and months. he said the processions aEURoewill be a fitting tribute to the vhp activists who were killed for the cause of construction of the ram mandir at ayodhyaaEUR. however, he said, gujarat will not be covered in this phase of the programme because of the disturbances and the tension prevailing in the state. while the vhpaEUR(tm)s programme is aimed at whipping up sentiments in favour of the temple construction all over the country, it could run into trouble in states ruled by congress and parties which are not part of the nda coalition at the centre. in fact, even in states like andhra pradesh, the ruling tdp may frown upon the programme. sources said the vhp had even sought the permission of the gujarat government to go ahead with the asthi yatra but decided not to go ahead following some back-channel talks with the political leadership.  	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 17, 2002  ahmedabad: when union home minister l k advani answered rajya sabha mp shabana azmiaEUR(tm)s query in the parliament on monday saying that more from the majority community fell to police bullets than the minorities in the recent riots, he was referring to the whole of gujarat. sixty per cent of the people who died due to police firing were from the majority community, the state-wide figures show. but the scene in ahmedabad is quite the reverse. in the city that is considered communally and politically most volatile, more members of the minority community died in the police firing. according to figures available, 57 per cent (23 out of 40) of the people killed in the police firing belong to the minority community. this figure should be seen with the toll of rioting in ahmedabad which shows that out of the 286 people killed, some 41 were hindus killed in about 5,500 rounds of firing by the police. similarly in the state, of the 571 people who died in other violence, 494 people from the minority community were killed in the riots that followed the godhra carnage as compared to 77 from the majority community. but the state figures, as against ahmedabad, show that of the 100 that succumbed to the police firing, 60 were hindus. aEUR~aEUR~if the minorities were the victims of riots as they were and at the same time more of them die in the police firing, then the most charitable that one can get is to say is that police firing was not well directed,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) said a retired senior police officer. aEUR~aEUR~on the other hand you could say that the local police have also fallen victim to the communal forces. some allegations that a very senior police officer stood and watched as mobs ran riot at the naroda and meghaninagar areas would only give credence to such a line of reasoning,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he added.	1	0	1	1	1

"This story is from March 24, 2002  bangalore: he surprised everyone by polling more votes than what was expected of him in the rajya sabha elections in 2000. back again in the fray, business tycoon vijay mallya, in an interview to the sunday times of india, says the congress has no choice this time but to support him given the ayodhya issue and other political developments. how confident are you in this rs election vis-a-vis 2000? given the ayodhya issue and political developments in the country, the secular parties and the janata parivar logically should be more sympathetic to get me elected rather than the bjp candidate. the congress has to make a choice whether it wants the bjp to win or an independent backed by secular parties. i find it difficult to believe the congress will support the bjp. hence, i assume they would consider my request seriously. clearly in 2000, i almost attempted the impossible. the congress and the bjp had sufficient number of votes. i was depending on a large number of independents and the janata dal. but the congress split the jd(s), admitted six besides 10 independents. so, i lost 16 votes which i was entitled to. this left me disillusioned. who were you disillusioned with aEUR"" the congress or the janata dal? i am inexperienced in politics. at that time, i did not think the congress would split the dal and admit independents into the party. it is a lesson i learnt that political parties have the clout and muscle to do this kind of things. it was a single-point agenda for the congress and the bjp that i should be defeated. i was facing a stonewall. but the congress has now been talking about allotting even the surplus votes to its three candidates? the rajya sabha election is of preferential votes aEUR"" first, second and so on. all votes have relevance. i can hardly believe that any congress member will vote for the bjp. i am, therefore, hoping these votes will come to me. did you meet chief minister s.m. krishna in this regard? i have met the cm and kpcc president allum veerabhadrappa and formally placed my request. they will take a decision in due course as there is still time. i am quite confident they would prefer an independent candidate to the bjp. how are your equations with krishna now as some differences had crept in during the previous rs elections? krishna and i have been friends for many years since my father''s times. he is still my friend and also happens to be my sambandhi. the question of having any disagreement or differences with him does not arise. nothing went wrong in 2000. maybe for a couple of days, there was frustration because the congress opposed me vehemently. in any healthy relationship or friendship, there is bound to be some ups and downs. otherwise, it is very artificial. your candidature is expected to put to test loyalty of mlas to their respective parties. do you think it is ethical on your part to wean them away? the procedure for rs election is well laid out. it is a secret ballot. this implies all mlas must vote with their conscience. on the contrary, i would argue it is unethical to issue a whip. it is basically impinging upon mlas'' freedom of choice. how does it feel to be in an election again? it is one of the toughest battles of my life. the mlas have to meet the aspirations of the people. since the mlas are my voters, i have to meet their aspirations. they tell me if you are elected, you are entitled to certain grants. what is going to be your policy on the allocation of these grants to our constituencies development. will you help us in projects, attend functions? there are so many questions and issues for which they demand an answer. it is a major learning curve for me. this is something that i completely missed in the past. do you think you can do justice to the mp''s post if elected, given your vast business? how many are full-time politicians? there are many mps in parliament who are businessmen. on the contrary, if i am elected, it will keep me in india for a longer time.

"This story is from March 25, 2002  surat: the chief vigilance commissioner on saturday advocated removal of all exemptions from the income tax, so that evaders would not go scot-free, burdening the tax payer. speaking at a public meeting organised by the southern gujarat chamber of commerce and industry (sgcci) and the surat citizen''s council trust at the gandhi smruti bhavan in the city, he said customs and excise should be made zero-discretion. this would not leave any room for industrialists to give their own interpretation of product categories and avoid paying heavy dues. he said political corruption can be weeded out only if the system is made transparent and as a step towards this, no person having charges framed against him should be allowed to contest elections or hold any political post, vittal said. he said laws should be made more stringent and all, including bureaucrats and industrialists, found to be corrupt should be punished severely. terming corruption as ""lack of moral, intellectual or financial integrity,"" vittal said it was the intelligent people who are more into corruption. it is said that corruption can be contained but not eliminated, he observed. corruption has pervaded the everyday life and in most of the societies, it has gained acceptance in some form or the other -- just as for many in gujarat, corruption is accounted for in the cost of production, vittal said. he said corruption cripples economic development. vittal said it was a vicious cycle beginning from the political corruption to bureaucratic corruption, industrial corruption and finally down to the criminals. answering queries, he said people should come forward and bring corruption to the notice of the vigilance commission. the system should be transparent so that honest people would come forward to complain, he added."	0	0	0	0	0
new delhi: jehadi groups in pakistan and underworld dons like dawood ibrahim, chhota shakeel and abu salem are planning terror attacks against those they hold responsible for killing muslims in the recent communal riots in gujarat. this has been learnt from several reports received by intelligence agencies recently. the intelligence bureau has submitted a report to the government including the prime minister on the matter. the report says some of the targets are functionaries of the gujarat government including chief minister narendra modi, some police officers of the state and leaders of pro-hindu organisations. ayodhya along with symbols, institutions and gatherings of hindus are also part of their planned targets. the report says pakistan-backed terrorist groups operating in jammu and kashmir see the prevailing scenario as an opportunity to make recruitments for their respective outfits from amongst muslims who have been affected by the riots. this is expected to enable these organisations to extend their activities to regions beyond kashmir. the groups have decided not to claim responsibility for any terrorist act perpetrated under this arrangement, since it could have an adverse impact on the pakistani establishment, the report says. the ib has learnt from reliable sources that jehadi groups, particularly lashkar-e-taiba, have deputed their cadres to plan and organise shootings and explosions in ayodhya. pakistani nationals are supposed to act as spearheads for such terror acts, in tandem with some local muslims. there are also reports of firearms including ak-47 rifles, grenades and explosives being moved from south kashmir to designated areas in up and nearby areas. in fact, there are indications that sahaba sainik, a bangladesh based pro- let group, has plans to infiltrate 800 of its supporters from bangladesh into the north-east to perpetrate terror attacks. the assessment of the intelligence agency is that whereas it took the underworld a few months to organise the aEUR~aEUR~retaliation to the demolition of the babri masjidaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) in 1993, this time the response may be even quicker since experience of recent years has shown easier access of terrorist outfits to weapons, explosives and other hardware on account of caches that are believed to have been created in different parts of the country. both the pmo and the home ministry are believed to be agitated about the reports and are said to be monitoring the situation. they have asked the administration in up, gujarat and other sensitive areas to be on the alert on this account.

This story is from March 18, 2002  ayodhya: as vhp-sponsored shila daan programme passed off peacefully on friday, role of few behind-the-scene operators who helped defuse the crisis and brought peace to the temple town, came to the fore. two ias, an ips, a raja and a bjp mp were part of a core team which burnt midnight oil in ayodhya to save the nation from 1992-like situation. their task, of implementing sc order and saving a precious life which, if floundered, would certainly have unleashed an orgy of violence all over the country, was both ticklish and arduous. the moment news of rjn chairman mahant ramchandra paramhans das threatening to end his life was flashed, the core group went into action. the raja of ayodhya, bimlendra mohan pratap mishra, a die hard mahant follower, set the ball rolling by rushing to the vhp workshop and sending an sos to navneet sehgal, former faizabad dm and now the suda director. both sehgal and the raja held initial round of talks with mahant das persuading and cajoling him to withdraw his threat. but when mahant reiterated his resolve on thursday eveningaEUR(tm)s press conference, messages were flashed to the pmo and mha. also, posting of harbhajan singh as ig zone came at the right time. the cool sardar also joined in while faizabad commissioner took control of the pmo and mha hotlines. local bjp mp vinay katiyar was requested to mediate on behalf of mahant das. though the commissioner had offered a compromise package early on thursday, it failed to cut much ice following mahant dasaEUR(tm) threat. serious negotiations started in the night. nothing seemed to be working initially. infuriated mahant even refused to attend prime minister and kanchi peace-maker jayendra saraswatiaEUR(tm)s calls. workshopaEUR(tm)s phone number 32835 was flooded with std calls from corridors of powers in delhi and religious heads all over the country. but nothing moved the mahant. after second rounds of talks, an annoyed mahant put up a aEUR~donaEUR(tm)t disturbaEUR(tm) board outside his dingy, poorly-lit room at the workshop and retired. but sehgal, harbhajan and katiyar continued deliberations. sehgal kept moving in and out. mobile was not working due to jammers installed at disputed rjb complex. he frequented commissioneraEUR(tm)s office and the nearby karsevakpuram to keep 7, race course and mha updated about the developments. the compromise formula was finally worked out at 1.00 am and an approval was sought from the prime minister and union home minister. tightlipped, sehgal, harbhajan and katiyar left the workshop, without uttering a word. but their body language was a clue enough that they had succeeded in their efforts. approval came with the arrival of shatrughan singh, a senior official of the cabinet secretariat, heading ayodhya cell in the pmo. he also called up the commissioner to confirm. and when the shila daan programme ended peacefully, there were smiles on all faces. after darshan of ram lalla and shila pujan at undisputed barasthan, mahant das withdrew his threat. aEURoeit was a team effort,aEUR said commissioner a k gupta. aEURoeit was all due to godaEUR(tm)s grace,aEUR retorted sehgal. aEURoeeven though we risked some on-the-spot decision, thank god the worked,aEUR said harbhajan triumphantly. aEURoeas a citizen, we had only made an effort to save ayodhya and thereby the country. aEURoeno political strings attached,aEUR smiled the raja of ayodhya. aEURoethe programme was altered in the interest of the country,aEUR shrewdly replied katiyar.  	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 20, 2002  kolkata: the sangh parivar outfits are damaging the prime ministeraEUR(tm)s credibility and vajpayee should be cautious about it, feels trinamul spokesman sudip bandyopadhyay. and to isolate itself from the parivar-inflicted damage, the trinamul congress is distancing itself from the nda. statements made by the top trinamul leaders over the past fort-night on major national issues are more in tune with an opposition party than with those from a member of the ruling alliance. on issues like godhra, gujarat riots and ayodhya, the trinamul has stridently opposed the nda. as the party was not in a position to vote for poto on monday, it stayed away from the lok sabha, even disregarding an nda directive to be present. trinamul chief mamata banerjee has been scathing in her criti-cism of the railway and general budgets, even accusing the va-jpayee government of giving concessions to the rich at the cost of the poor. bandyopadhyay does not mince words while explaining his partyaEUR(tm)s hardening of stand vis-a-vis the nda, especially the bjp. aEURoewe want to drive home the message that the government at the centre is not a bjp government. we have come together on the basis of the common minimum programme and this must be fol-lowed,aEUR he asserted.	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 20, 2002  bangalore: the bangalore police on wednesday imposed day curfew in the riot-torn j j nagar after one of the victims of last week''s violence succumbed in hospital. as soon as news of the death of r nagaraju spread, tension gripped j j nagar, forcing senior police officers to camp in the area. nagaraju is the first victim of the violence that broke out in bangalore after the controversial shila daan was performed in ayodhya on march 15. tension was palpable in j j nagar and the adjoining padarayanapura off mysore road when the body of nagaraju was brought back from the hospital. nagaraju had received grievous injuries in an attack on saturday night. nagaraju was with his nephews -- shankar and manju -- when an armed gang of about 12 persons accosted him. shankar recalled: ``four of the assailants were masked and were wielding swords. they charged towards us, headed straight for nagaraju but did not beat us up. one of the assailants hit nagaraju in the face with a portable tailoring machine. another slashed his face and neck. the third attacker slashed his arm. as nagaraju collapsed screaming in horror, one of the attackers crushed him with a boulder and left him for dead.''''  	0	0	1	0	0
new delhi: the nda allies claimed credit for the peaceful conclusion of the shila daan at ayodhya. relieved at not being pushed by the sangh parivar and the bjp hawks into taking a stand, some of the allies are back to the business of seeking the spoils of office. and none of the allies wanted to comment on the governnment official accepting the stone slab from the vhp to facilitate shila daan at ayodhya. with the crisis blowing over, tdp chief chandrababu naidu has revived the process of identifying a candidate for the speakeraEUR(tm)s post. apparently, the pm has asked naidu to propose a candidate for the post. all the four dalit mps from the tdp and its parliamentary party leader yerran naidu are back in the race that was temporarily impeded by the vhp programme. there is widespread apprehension among the allies over the surfacing of the internal contradictions of the sangh parivar. but then they, including the tdp, despite their posturing appear, are willing to put up with the parivaraEUR(tm)s tantrums rather than face mid-term polls. aEUR~aEUR~with the congress winning state after state, we cannot afford to pull this government down. nor are we prepared for a mid-term poll. so the government will go on from one crisis to another till the bjp decides otherwise,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) said a senior tdp leader. sudip bandopadhyay of the trinamul congress said the allies should be given the credit for the peace in ayodhya on friday. aEUR~aEUR~all the secular allies had come together and put pressure on the government and hence everything went off peacefully,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he said. other allies have left it to the opposition to debate singhaEUR(tm)s role in the vhp programme, as they feel relieved that their fears have been belied. aEUR~aEUR~we had kept a vigil on our states. now even the minorities have appreciated the governmentaEUR(tm)s handling of the situation,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) said bandopadhyay.

new delhi: the bjp was put on the mat by two of its own allies on the ayodhya issue on saturday in the lok sabha: the telugu desam party and the trinamul congress not only repeated their criticism of the attorney general toeing the vhp line in the supreme court; they also sought a clarification from the prime minister on the claim made by the vhp after the shila daan ceremony - that the acceptance of the carved pillar by a government official meant the government had accepted the demand for the construction of the ram temple. this forced the prime minister to declare that the construction of the ram temple will depend on the supreme court verdict: aEUR~aEUR~if the verdict goes against temple construction, it has to be respected,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he said, while replying to a debate on his statement regarding the situation in ayodhya. he added that he had never assured the vhp of resolving the issue by march 12, maintaining that the possibility of a solution through dialogue should be explored. earlier, in a hard-hitting speech, the tdpaEUR(tm)s yerran naidu said, aEUR~aEUR~the vhp says the government has sanctioned the construction of the temple. we want to know from the pm whether that is true.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) taking the same line, an emotional mamata bannerjee (trinamul congress) said, aEUR~aEUR~it is shocking when the government speaks for one religious community, not the country. what the a-g says may suit the government, and what the government thinks may suit the a-g, but it does not suit us.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) if the allies were on the offensive, the bjp was clearly on the defensive: union law minister arun jaitley was forced to retreat on several points he made, by the congress and the cpm. jaitley sought to answer some legal points on the implications of the supreme courtaEUR(tm)s 1994 judgment on the act through which land adjacent to the disputed spot in ayodhya was acquired, which were made by cpmaEUR(tm)s somnath chatterjee. but since he had to read out from the same judgment, he was not able to justify his claims that the acquired land could be handed over at any stage to anyone by the government. worse, jaitley was forced to withdraw two statements: first, when he sought to justify the presence of an ias officer deputed by the centre at the shila daan ceremony, by saying that when the shilanyas took place in 1989, the congress home minister of the day had been present. the man in question, buta singh leapt to his feet to deny it and jaitley was forced to withdraw the remark. next, he accused chatterjee of misleading the house through selective reading of the 1994 judgment - when chatterjee rose to refute this, jaitley had to beat a hasty retreat.

"This story is from March 18, 2002  gandhinagar: in a controversial statement that would raise many an eyebrow among the state''s farmers'' associations, especially the bharatiya kisan sangh - a sangh parivar outfit - the state government made it clear on saturday that all new electricity connections in the farm sector will be metered. ""we cannot do anything about it,"" finance minister nitin patel declared, concluding the general debate on the budget for 2002-03 presented on february 27 in the state assembly. ""this is the direction of the gujarat electricity regulatory commission (gerc). we cannot violate it,"" he added. bjp mlas, in the absence of the opposition congress, asked the finance minister whether he wished to abolish metering or not for new connections being provided. a bjp mla even questioned the logic of the state government of giving metered electricity to new connections provided by the gujarat electricity board, 10 years after one was in a queue. nitin merely said, ""i will consult the matter with energy minister kaushik patel."" congress mlas continued their boycott of the assembly on saturday in protest against the suspension of their leader naresh raval for three days. at the same time, he sought to assuage the bjp mlas'' feeling by saying the old unmetered connections will not be touched. ""no proposal is under consideration to meter the electricity provided to the farmers on horse power basis"", he said, adding, ""we will continue to provide subsidy to the geb for giving subsidised power on horse power basis, as before"". currently, the state provides rs 1,300 crore budgeted subsidy to the geb, of which rs 1,100 crore is as compensation to cheap power to the farm sector. currently, there are in all nearly 70,000 metered connections in the state, 65,000 of them having been given after the gerc order two years back. the metered electricity is being provided at the rate of 50 paise per unit, plus electricity duty. as for the non-metered connections, charges are based on the horse power strength of the motor put up to pump out water from the underground. per unit charge of such connections comes to approximately 16 paise. nearly 49 per cent of geb electricity is used up by the farm sector, mainly in the north gujarat region. nitin''s statement acquires significance against the backdrop of the state government''s intention to come up with the electricity reforms bill for discussion in the current assembly session. the bill makes stage-by-stage conversion into metered connection compulsory, a precondition for the 350 million dollar asian development bank loan. already, the state has asked the gerc to review the latter''s earlier judgment to meter all connections within three years. it wants gerc to extend the period to five years. during his intervention, nitin denied that the recent communal riots would adversely affect the state''s economy. ""despite the massive earthquake, we were able to overcome the effect it had on the economy within four months. we are quite capable of dealing with disasters. some people say that gujarat has been pushed back by 20 years. those who make such statements as also those who hear them are mad. we are studying the situation. the industry would be back on the rails soon,"" he pointed out."	0	0	0	0	0

vadodara: in the first move of its kind in gujarat, the city police on tuesday filed firs against two local news channels for allegedly inciting communal feelings in vadodara. the city police sealed the premise of one of the channels and arrested four persons in this connection. the crackdown took the operators of the news channels, vadodara news magazine (vnm) and news plus channel (npc), by surprise as they had reached an agreement with the police last week to exercise restraint over what they broadcast. ever since disturbances began here, the police have alleged that certain broadcasts by these channels were adding fuel to the fire. in fact, commissioner of police d d tuteja had written to them asking them not to shoot sensitive material. vnm is the oldest news programme producer in the city while npc is the new and started broadcasting on february 1. vnmaEUR(tm)s partners nafis khan and ajay kapoor as well as editor-in- chief a d vyas have been arrested. npcaEUR(tm)s jitendra pandya has also been arrested. all the accused were subsequently granted bail by the court. the channels concerned have registered a strong protest against the move. npc proprietor and editor jitendra pandya said his channel was targeted for its anti-police stand. aEUR~aEUR~we have footage which clearly indicates inaction by the police. several channels broadcast riot footage. why was action taken only against us?aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) he asked. vnmaEUR(tm)s vyas, on the other hand, says on many occasions the police had called upon the news channels to cover the arms recovered in combing operations. aEUR~aEUR~they would also mention the areas concerned. doesnaEUR(tm)t this instigate people of other localities? while some channels had shown raw footage of violence outside regular news hours. we showed riot-related footage only in our regular news capsule. their complaints are quite baseless,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) vyas said.

This story is from March 15, 2002  lucknow: former chief minister and bjp leader rajnath singh has urged the religious leaders of muslim, christian and other communities to come forward and prevent ram janmabhoomi nyas (rjn) chief from ending his life. expressing deep concern over the threat given by the saint that he would end his life if he is not allowed to perform religious rites at ayodhya on friday, singh said he was not only the rjn chief, but was a great 'dharmacharya' (religious leader) worshipped by hindus. he said he was deeply hurt by this announcement made by paramhans and urged him to withdraw this decision since his guidance was needed by the hindu society for many years to come. talking to mediapersons at a hurriedly called press conference here on thursday, singh lamented that the court had not been able to decide a title suit pending before it since 1949, even after fifty years. he said that had it not been delayed so much, the situation would not have taken such a critical turn. he said in a democratic set up, it was the duty of every wing, including judiciary, legislature and executive, to take speedy decisions at least on such sensitive issues. he said that even after the 1992 episode, the court had not taken any step to speed up the disposal of the case. he welcomed the central government's action requesting the court to take steps for speedy disposal of this case. singh said those who criticised attorney general soli sorabjee for his submission before the supreme court regarding the puja perhaps did not realise the gravity of the situation. he said it was only an attempt to avert any unpleasant situation. replying to a question regarding the samajwadi party's (sp) decision to send its workers to ayodhya, singh said sp had always attempted to damage national unity. the former chief minister alleged that sp was trying to complicate the situation and fan trouble in ayodhya. quoting an example, he said the sp leaders always tried to disturb communal harmony by creating unruly scenes every year in the parliament on december 6.	0	0	0	0	0

new delhi: a day after gujarat chief minister narendra modi met the prime minister to claim all was under control in his state, a group of civil liberties activists from baroda came to delhi to ''tell the country that if modi is not removed, nobody can save gujarat''. journalist and human rights activist kirit bhatt -- a co-accused with defence minister george fernandes in the emergency-era baroda dynamite case -- told times news network that ''modi being called to delhi is just a show, to ask for the score''. contrary to government claims, the activists from gujarat say that now mobs are committing ''low-intensity, high-precision violence'' against muslim property. ''everyday, with police connivance, they defy curfew to burn and loot muslims' property,'' said deeptha achar, who teaches in the m s university, baroda. achar claims she was an eye-witness to police complicity in the violence. ''on march 1, five of us teachers were giving company to prof bandookwala's daughter after her father was removed to a safe haven. i heard two police constables telling the mob, 'we'll give you 15 minutes, don't go through the front door, go via the back door.' they were supposed to guard the house that was completely destroyed by the mob.'' these aggrieved gujaratis seek transparency and a community-wise break up of the victims of police firing. the government has been tom-tomming the number of deaths in police firing, but the eye-witnesses from the riot-hit areas have a different story to tell. ''on march 15, the ayodhya shila daan day, there was a maha arti in baroda that got converted into a rally. the rally turned into a mob as it got into a muslim area, macchipith, at friday juma time. when muslim youths pelted stones on the mob, the police that was accompanying the mob fired at the muslim youths,'' said kirit bhatt. according to these concerned citizens, the first target of the mob is muslim lives and property (not so much lives as property), then come hindus who help their muslim brethren, and then honest police officers. related stories  Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail	1	0	1	1	1

"new delhi: the bjp-led government went into a spin on thursday night after ramjanambhoomi nyas (rjn) chief ramchandra paramhans announced his determination to kill himself if the government receiver did not permit him to carry out shila daan. with the vhp and the rjn hardening their position and even the rss no longer sympathetic, the government was down on its knees. first, home minister l k advani had a half-an-hour telephonic conversation with vhp chief ashok singhal to ask him to use his persuasive skills with paramhans to get him to withdraw his suicide threat, so that the government was not compelled to arrest him for his own safety. simultaneously, an sos was sent to rss leaders - who are camping in bangalore for their akhil bharatiya karyakari mandal - to talk to paramhans directly. finally, even the caste card was used, with former uttar pradesh chief minister rajnath singh and external affairs minister jaswant singh issuing a joint appeal to fellow thakur, paramhans. if the government had thought wednesday''s court ruling would - if temporarily - take care of its worries, thursday''s developments clearly proved it wrong. all day, ministers tried unsuccessfully to persuade the vhp-rjn to defer the march 15 programme till after june 2, saying that the interim period could be used to mobilise the sort of public opinion that even the court might take heed of, when it gives its next ruling after 10 weeks. initially, reports that the supreme court was going to issue clarifications in its order of wednesday raised hopes that some ceremony would be permitted. but once it was clear that legally nothing was possible, the vhp issued an ultimatum: vhp functionary pravin togadia warned that if paramhans was prevented from handing over the shila or there was any firing, it would be the signal for ""crores of kar sevaks"" to proceed towards ayodhya. he said they no longer wanted to begin temple construction on the acquired land; now, they wanted the disputed spot itself. indeed, patience in the saffron brotherhood appeared to be running out. rss sources pointed to the resolution adopted in bangalore on friday which said the court verdict had hurt the ""sentiments of millions of hindus"".

"This story is from March 25, 2002  ahmedabad: gujarat''s image of being a progressive state has taken a major beating because of the recent communal riots. this statement came from none other than wipro chief azim premji while speaking to gujarati businessmen in ahmedabad on saturday. according to him, the riots have put the state back by a few years in terms of future investments. ""don''t underestimate the homework that multinational companies (mncs) do on their potential investment destinations, especially in terms of the city risk and state risk. they will not set up operations in ahmedabad or gujarat because the risk is too high,"" premji warned the gathering at an interactive session held at the ahmedabad management association. the gujarat government too came in for scathing criticism on its attitude towards the information technology (it) sector. premji minced no words when asked about his views on the reasons why gujarat had been a non-starter in it. ""the gujarat government has been sleeping on this issue. state governments have to aggressively market themselves and deliver on those promises, which other state governments like karnataka, andhra pradesh and maharashtra have successfully demonstrated. but the gujarat government has failed to do this."" ""we have development centres in all these states and could have had one in gujarat too as 12 per cent of our work force is from gujarat and i''m sure they would like to work closer to their homes and families but this hasn''t happened because of the state government''s attitude,"" he added. delivering the convocation address at the indian institute of management, ahmedabad''s 37th convocation later in the evening, he chanted the mantra of managing change for the passing-out students. ""while change and uncertainty have always been part of life, what has been shocking over the last year has been the quantum and suddenness of change,"" he said. ""for many people who were cruising along in placid waters, the wind was knocked out of their sails."" according to premji, while sudden change always gets attention, it is the gradual change that is ignored till it is too late. ""you must develop your own early warning system, which warns you of changes and calls your attention to it. in the case of change, being forewarned is being forearmed."" he also told the students that the fear of the unknown was natural. ""with change comes the feeling of insecurity. many people believe that brave people are not affected by this malady. the truth is different. everyone feels the fear of the unknown. courage is not the absence of fear, but the ability to manage fear without getting paralysed."" these were but two of the 10 pearls of wisdom that he dropped for the students."	0	0	0	0	0
"This story is from March 30, 2002  though i hold no brief for the communal bjp, jagmohanaEUR(tm)s well-meant drive against illegal constructions is the single most important factor which went against the bjp. jagmohanaEUR(tm)s drive didnaEUR(tm)t go down well with our self-obssessed middle class which is not capable of seeing beyond its grubby noses. it ganged up against the honest minister and got him shunted to another portfolio. our people are not willing to accept certain minimum obligations that other free countries have imposed on their citizens. i have little hope from the congress. jagtar singh, chanakyapuri the anti-incumbency factor, jagmohanaEUR(tm)s highhandedness in bulldozing illegal constructions, and the infighting among the partyaEUR(tm)s mps from delhi contributed to the bjpaEUR(tm)s debacle in the mcd elections. the gujarat riots and the partyaEUR(tm)s kid-glove treatment of the vhp on the ayodhya drama also took secular votes away from it. further, the party didnaEUR(tm)t endear itself to the salaried class by imposing more taxes on them and raising the prices of essentials like lpg. it is hoped that with the congress controlling both the state government and the mcd, there would be better coordination and easy availability of funds for development. bhaskar bhatt, pari bari marg. the bjp corporators were busy promoting their own interests at the expense of the common man. they never bothered to address the issues of erratic water and electricity supply, health care, pollution and transport. the recent role of the central government in gujarat and ayodhya only contributed to its debacle in the civic elections. one is not sure whether the congress, which now controls both the state government and the mcd, will be able to address the woes of the delhiite. r.l. pathak, lodhi colony. the decline of the bjp started in 1999 itself when it took over the government at the centre by abandoning the basic issues on which it had got votes. it abandoned the issues of the ram temple, article 370 and a uniform civil code for the sake of power. then the stunts it enacted aEUR"" like the bus yatra to lahore aEUR"" only made it unpopular with people. it failed to control subversive elements. it failed in kargil. it inducted ministers with a criminal record in the up ministry and marginalised honest ministers like jagmohan. it entered into unholy alliances in assam and karnataka for the assembly elections. it persisted with finance minister yashwant sinha despite the fact that this man had failed to deliver on any front. the bjp has run out of steam and its future is bleak. the temple issue will not mobilise votes for it now. well, yes, the bjp has failed delhi. but the congress is not a remedy either. the record of its state government doesnaEUR(tm)t inspire much confidence. k.r. rai, janakpuri the bjpaEUR(tm)s reckless drive against illegal constructions in delhi and its handling of the communal carnage drove people away from it. it is now downhill for the bjp. it has been routed in four states, and its future at the centre looks bleak.delhiites are not fools to expect much from the congress. the party has a poor track record of development. vidyasagar, yojana vihar every action has a reaction. the poor record of the bjpaEUR(tm)s councillors was bound to hit its prospects in the polls. there was chaos as for as civic amenities were concerned. the state government, controlled by the congress, said something, and the mcd, controlled by the bjp, said something else. the two were working at cross-purposes. its finance minister yashwant sinha did not help matters by fleecing the middle class by imposing more burden on them.with the congress controlling both the state government and the mcd, let us hope there is a better coordination between the two. p.n. sachdev, anand vihar. the reasons for the bjpaEUR(tm)s rout in the mcd elections are obvious enough. its drive against illegal constructions, the anti-poor budget, the gujarat riots, the anti-incumbency factor, and the rumblings in the nda contributed to the partyaEUR(tm)s debacle in delhi. with the congress at the helm in the state and the mcd, more funds will ensure more development. it is up to the congress how it seizes this opportunity. o.p. bansal, janakpuri. by slicing off a huge chunk from the income of the middle class, the bjp antagonised its traditional vote bank. second, in connivance with the business community (which it represents), the party pursued an erratic policy on liberalisation and privatisation. people could see its game plan. third, it failed to rein in the rss, the vhp and the bajrang dal. and the party continues to persist with narender modi who is stoking the communal fire in his state. expect no better days for delhi because the congress is equally communal and power-hungry. ashok gupta, bali nagar. the bjpaEUR(tm)s anti-encroachment drive drove people away from it. the budget applied no balm on the bruised middle class either. anupam jain, rajinder nagar. the muddled budget and the communal riots did the bjp in. people see the bjp as incapable of governing. see how it is turning a blind eye to the shenanigans of the so-called sangh parivar. who are these people by the way? how many hindus do they represent? they are a bunch of self-serving middle-class people who donaEUR(tm)t have to bother about their bread and butter. they must be curbed and handed down stiff penalties. only then does the bjp has any future. the congress is the other side of the same coin. expect no respite,
