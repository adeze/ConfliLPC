surat: the overall situation in the curfew-bound nine police station areas in the city and other parts of the district was well under control during tuesday night, police said here on wednesday. earlier, over 50 persons were arrested following vigorous combing operation, carried out on tuesday during the curfew relaxation period in most sensitive athwa and limbayat police station areas, police said adding, the search yielded recovery of large number of lethal weapons and stones from some places. these persons were arrested for possessing illegal lethal weapons under arms act, police added. police had fired ten rounds in the air to scare away the unruly mob, allegedly pelting stones last night in limbayat area and also lobbed five tear gas shells to control the situation. however, due to marked improvement in this sensitive city, the curfew was relaxed for the day from 7.00 am this morning to 8.00 pm, the sources added. meanwhile, in trouble-torn bardoli taluka town under surat rural police jurisdiction, night curfew continued where the overall situation is peaceful for the third successive night, police added. related storiesA narendra modi visits riot-hit areas A police reports name vhp, bjp leadersA ''he made 200 phone calls for help''A pray for peace in gujaratA gujarat riots: the story so farA A A full coverage    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail	0	1	1	0	1
"new delhi: the uncertain political situation in up, which is under the central rule despite a new legislative assembly having already been elected, may settle for good two controversial issues. one, whether the governor is under an obligation to invite the leader of the single largest legislative party alone to form the government. two, whether the sc judgment in the s r bommai case is the only yardstick to gauge the situation to impose president''s rule under article 356 of the constitution. the bommai judgment had come on a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of dissolving the assemblies of four bjp-ruled states in the aftermath of the demolition of ayodhya mosque. the states so brought under central rule had duly elected leader of the legislative party. certain states did not have any law and order problem, yet its dissolution was upheld by the court. ""any state government which pursues unsecular policies or unsecular course of action acts contrary to the constitutional mandate and renders itself amenable to action under article 356,"" the constitution bench had ruled. but, governor vishnu kant shastri''s recommendation for president''s rule in a situation, which was hypothetical during the bommai case hearing, can be challenged but without ""legally sustainable arguments"", says lawyer c s vaidhyanathan. ""there can be no ground to seek the court''s intervention against president''s rule in up...the decision cannot be challenged as mala fide as shastri has offered equal opportunity to all the leaders to form he government,"" agrees another lawyer, ashok arora. similarly, senior advocate vishwa nath saraf says:""the facts and circumstances which led to the bommai judgment were different. the principles laid down in the bommai judgment such as of the floor test to judge the majority cannot be applied in up as leaders of different political parties have to prima facie satisfy the governor that they yield requisite support."" since coalition governments are no more alien to the parliamentary form of democracy, the up case may well negate the argument that leader of the single largest legislative party alone can and should be allowed to form the government. though bsp is the third largest party, its leader, mayawati, who has resigned from lok sabha, may still be invited to form a ""stable"" government if she satisfies the governor that she has the support of the bjp and some other legislators. if mayawati is invited, it would establish that it is not the prerogative of the leader of the single largest party alone to form the government. and that the governor is under no constitutional obligation to invite such a leader who cannot satisfy him that he can form a stable government. that the floor of the house has to be the sole ground to test the strength may be the only requirement, where a government is already formed, but that may not be permissible when a leader merely claims that he would be able to form a ""stable"" government.

chennai: bjp''s national executive would meet next month to discuss the party''s poor performance in the recent elections to four state assemblies, bjp vice president r rama rao said here on friday. the results were a ''setback'' to the bjp and the national executive would suggest corrective measures, he told a press meet, adding the date and venue of the meeting would be decided soon. on the ayodhya dispute, rao said there was hope for an early settlement to the issue, with the kanchi seer, sri jayendra saraswathi, mediating. congress and left parties should stop their ''confrontationist'' attitude and support sankaracharya''s initiative for a solution to the dispute. vhp, which had been saying that it would not accept a court verdict, had also declared that it would abide by the court order. under these circumstances, opposition should cooperate with the government for a solution, he said. though two nda constituents, telugu desam and trinamool congress, had initially expressed reservation to the sankarachaya''s initiative, they had now supported his moves. on the escape of two al umma militants, while they were being taken to chennai from madurai, he said the escape had clearly exposed the nexus between the militants inside the prison and outside. tamil nadu government should take action to prevent recurrence of these incidents, he said. the escaped militants were accused in the rss building bomb blast case, he pointed out.

"new delhi: as part of efforts to end the ayodhya impasse, prime minister atal bihari vajpayee on monday night held consultations with shankaracharya of kanchi kamakoti peetam sri jayendra saraswathi. the pontiff met the prime minister after holding wide-ranging discussions with vhp top brass and other hindu religious leaders, who have vowed to go ahead with shifting of carved stones to the ram janambhoomi site in ayodhya on march 15. according to vhp international working president ashok singhal, the seer would urge vajpayee to hand over the undisputed land acquired by the government to the ram janambhoomi trust and lift restrictions enforced in the temple town. president of ram janambhoomi nyas (trust), mahant paramhans ramchandra das, singhal, vhp senior vice-president acharya giriraj kishore and its general secretary praveenbhai togadiya also met the shankaracharya who arrived here on a ''peace mission'' on monday morning, sources said. the shankaracharya, whose visit to the capital was kept ""very secret"" till the last minute, is on a mission to prevail upon the vhp leadership to postpone its temple construction plan, according to mutt sources.

"ayodhya: defying prohibitory orders, about 100 kar sevaks, mostly women and children, on tuesday took out a symbolic march in ayodhya. the kar sevaks, assembled in the temple city, took out the march this morning from ''kar sevak puram'', a camp set up for them, to another camp ''ram sevak puram'', covering a distance of about half a kilometre, and back, sources said. vhp sources said the kar sevaks would take out the march tomorrow also. the march was taken out a day after the authorities put up public notices outside the two camps informing imposition of prohibitory orders under section 144 of crpc banning rallies and demonstrations. significantly, the notices were no more on the walls and were apparently torn off. police seemed to take the development lightly as a senior official when contacted said the effort of the authorities was to prevent the kar sevaks from coming on to the main roads. meanwhile, a batch of 75 kar sevaks were on monday transported out of ayodhya by the government-provided vehicles, additional director general of police (law and order) a k mitra said. he said there had been no fresh arrivals of kar sevaks during the past two days ""although they are making attempts"". ""we are keeping a close watch. while they are trying to reach here, our effort is to prevent them,"" mitra said. vhp, however, dismissed this and claimed that at least 75 kar sevaks from maharashtra had reached ayodhya since sunday night. ""they were stopped at places like saharanpur and gonda but they used various means, including walking, to reach here,"" said vhp media officer sharad sharma. he said from monday local kar sevaks had started participating in the programmes and the activity was expected to pick up in the coming days unless the vhp leaders and saints in delhi decide otherwise. related storiesA advani meets shankaracharyaA hand over ayodhya land by june 2: vhpA babri masjid panel threatens to move sc    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	1	0	0

"This story is from March 11, 2002  pune: even as gujarat burned in the aftermath of the godhra killings, communally-sensitive mumbai remained peaceful. this has been attributed in large part to the prompt action taken by the 30-odd mohalla committees which have been set up to ensure that religious sentiments do not flare up as they did in the past. pune, too, has been following the example of mumbai by nurturing the mohalla committee movement. the city has no history of sustained communal rioting; the worst was in 1965 during a ganpati festival; others have been confined to pockets of the city. while the anatomy of a communal riot is very complex, and whether a city falls victim to it or not depends on several factors, the mohalla committee concept is one well worth pursuing. around 30 mohalla committees exist throughout pune. they were set up in the wake of the devastating communal conflagration that engulfed neighbouring mumbai ten years ago. ""the 1992 riots in mumbai were a iesson for us and we decided that pune should not become like mumbai. we earnestly started contacting neighbours and soon had excellent co-ordination, not only with the police, but also the municipal ward officers and corporators,"" says gita vir, member of the koregaon park mohalla committee. the mohalla committee, she says, tries to build up a sense of belonging in a community. this creates a feeling of unity and hence of security. as the events of gujarat proved last week, the participation of the police would be crucial. deputy commissioner of police (zone one) vinod lokhande, who supervises the ''communally sensitive'' areas of the city, confirms that the once a month meeting of all mohalla committees is extremely useful in maintaining harmony. ""we urge members not to give vent to their anger no matter what happens. we also teach them precautionary measures, how to defuse rumours and when to alert the police,"" lokhande says. essentially, the mohalla committee members could be the voice of reason that is required when the mischief starts. seventy-nine-year-old anantrao vavhal is an active member of the cantonment mohalla committee. in april last year rumours about stone pelting and burning of the quran were doing the rounds and it was essential to defuse the situation. ""an angry mob had gathered and we were worried about what would happen. so we took some of the community leaders to the spots where the outrage was supposed to have occurred and showed them that nothing had actually happened. the tension slowly defused,"" vavhal says. rajni behel is a member of the uday baug mohalla committee and used to work in a mohalla committee when living in mumbai. ""we have already created an excellent atmosphere in the locality and the rule is we mention only our nationality. religion is kept inside the home and we don''t allow public displays of religious ceremonies,"" she says. she is worried, though, that young people are not taking an interest in this activity, a sentiment echoed by vavhal. vir would like much more participation from the public. there are many retired police officials and ex-servicemen who can get involved. ""in mumbai, people like (former police commissioner) julio ribeiro have devoted themselves to the movement and it has paid rich dividends."" mohalla committee members in pune say that the police have always been extremely co-operative. julio ribeiro told times news network that ""no police officer wants communal trouble in his area, so the police always encourage such initiatives"". in mohalla committees he is involved with in mumbai, the police are encouraged to participate in health camps and computer classes to build up a feeling of trust among minority communities. ribeiro says every major city must have mohalla committees irrespective of whether it has a history of communal riots or not. ""recently, noted billiards player geet sethi requested me to go to ahmedabad with him so that we can start the movement there. we plan to go this week and start the good work,"" says the former ''super cop''. he also sounded a word of caution when it comes to recruiting people into the committees. ""only honest and sincere people who have a good character and no political ambition must be chosen,"" he advises."	0	0	1	0	0

"new delhi: former district magistrate of faizabad r n srivastava, during whose tenure the disputed structure at ayodhya was demolished in december 6, 1992, on thursday said that the state government had not taken any decision to stop the kar sevaks during the period before that.

""i remember that i had sent a notice to state government that kar sevaks should not come from other states as there were already 2.5 lakh of them in ayodhya,"" he said when asked whether the district administration had thought of restricting the entry of kar sevaks to the temple town. when the commission''s counsel anupam gupta asked whether at any point of time the state government or district administration contemplated or raised the issue for providing a security force with proper balance of communal mix, srivatava said that he came to know from the home department that state government was opposed to the deployment of central police force. ""this situation remained till 12.30 pm on december 6,"" he said, adding ssp faizabad at a meeting of dgp level had asked for additional force but he was given to understand that it was expected that kar sevaks would be peaceful and state government had sanctioned whatever it could.

"This story is from March 11, 2002  ahmedabad: the allegations regarding possible police inaction and administrative failure during godhra and its aftermath were expected to be allayed, albeit to an extent, by the appointment of a commission of inquiry headed by retired high court judge kg shah. instead, a fresh controversy, a volley of allegations and strong apprehensions have greeted the notification. though most of the criticism revolves around the fact that this inquiry should have been headed by a sitting judge or a panel of sitting judges, a past judgment delivered by justice shah is also being called into question by his critics along with the fact that he has had an association with the bjp government, having been on the panel of lawyers of the state government in the supreme court. justice shah had sentenced five to death, convicting them of burning alive eight persons in dabgarwad on june 9, 1985, during communal riots that followed the anti-reservation protests. however, his judgment was reversed by the supreme court on the ground that ""the finding of the judge... is not based on appreciation of evidence but on imagination"". talking to tnn at his apartment in the judges'' bungalows area of ahmedabad, justice shah seemed unfazed by the opposition to his appointment. ""don''t expect this retired judge, who is in his late sixties, to assure that justice will be done. a judge doesn''t have to assure justice, that''s his duty and that''s why a judicial inquiry is preferred to others."" he is also not in the least bit hassled about the possibility of his report being shelved or commission wound up, as has been the norm in the past. ""looking at the scale of the incidents and the way the government acted...almost promptly issuing the notification...it seems unlikely,"" he opines. commenting on the opposition to his appointment, he observed that ""no appoinment can please all"". he admits that the inquiry will take longer than the three months stipulated. ""i am very clear that it is physically impossible to complete the task in three months. it will be done as expeditiously as possible. but nothing should be expected overnight."" as for the allegations about his political leanings, he said he had never heard of them. he refused to even discuss them further. even the mention of the sensational judgment in the dabgarwad case upsets him. ""don''t even mention that. a judge''s duty is quite difficult...if questions are to be raised like this, how can a judge perform his duty?"" while condemning godhra and its aftermath as ""absolutely brutal acts of large magnitude"", he informs that the inquiry will be a large-scale exercise. but many continue to have apprehensions about his appointment. ""a retired judge should not be appointed to inquire into such a sensitive issue. as was done in 1969, a sitting supreme court judge assisted by at least three other high court judges should be asked to conduct an inquiry within 60 days,"" says former chief minister and congress leader shankersinh vaghela. ""retired judges tend to become dependent on the government and ultimately their reports are shelved,"" he adds for good measure. noted human rights activist and senior lawyer girish patel observes, ""in this atmosphere of terror and fear that prevails in the state after serious communal riots, any commission headed by a local man, however high or independent he may be, will not improve confidence of the people."" he suggests an inquiry by a supreme court judge, after dissolving the state commission. ""it''s better if someone from outside is appointed. the state government is involved and is a party to what happened. how can a party appoint a judge? we cannot expect him to give justice,"" says dr shakeel ahmed of the cell for legal help and guidance of the islamic relief committee. an eminent lawyer and activist belonging to the minority community had this to say: ""our community has no faith in this commission because the person heading it is known to be a staunch supporter of the ruling party. we want a non-gujarati former chief justice of the supreme court of india."" ""credibility of the inquiry commission matters,"" says congress leader and lawyer shaktisinh gohil, while agreeing with vaghela''s demand for the inquiry to be headed by a sitting supreme court judge and assisted by a panel of high court judges. a retired high court judge said on the condition of anonymity that the godhra incident should have been probed by the cbi, and its aftermath by a judicial commission."	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 7, 2002  chandigarh: cotton-growers may be allowed to grow the legally-approved genetically modified cotton variety in the coming kharif season. according to senior officials in the ministry of agriculture, the field trials of bacillus thercinogenesis implanted cotton seeds, conducted under the supervision of the indian council of agriculture research and the department of bio-technology, have shown positive results on all parameters. it is likely to get the go-ahead from the genetic engineering approval committee of the ministry of environment and forests. official sources said the government had also taken cognisance of the experience of other cottongrowing nations in the world, including china, where one-third of the produce is of the bt variety. the genetically modified variety has attracted a great deal of attention from farmers in punjab and haryana, where cotton is cultivated in about 12 lakh hectares. haryana financial commissioner and secretary, agriculture, naseem ahmed said:aEUR~aEUR~the effect of american bollworm on the cotton crop in punjab and haryana assumed epidemic proportions in 2001. more than 50 per cent of the crop was lost to the disease. in haryana alone, seven lakh bales of cotton were produced against an estimated production of 15 lakh bales.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) ahmed said farmers failed to control the disease despite 15 rounds of pesticide spraying. haryanaaEUR(tm)s joint director, cotton, b s duggal, said: aEUR~aEUR~cotton-growers ultimately ended up paying from their own pockets.against an average return of rs 10,000 a hectare in 2001, an average cotton grower ended up spending around rs 11,000 just to save the crop.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) spraying of pesticides cost rs 7,000 a hectare. officials said the fear of american bollworm led to stray cases of farmers buying the genetically modified seeds from gujarat on their own. aEUR~aEUR~and in some cases, they ended up buying the wrong variety due to their ignorance,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) pointed out haryanaaEUR(tm)s director of agriculture rajeev arora. special secretary, agricultrure, hemendra kumar, said:aEUR~aEUR~the gm variety cannot be introduced without stringent field trials of the new variety. the trials have been done keeping in view the local growing conditions, ecology, chances of development of a monoculture and development resistance to the gene by american bollworm. the report is ready and the decison will be known in the near future.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm)	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 14, 2002  lucknow: as march 15 draws near, the tension in ayodhya and the state is getting to be palpable. all eyes are on the faizabad district administration and how it is going to handle the situation in case the vishwa hindu parishad leaders and the ram janmabhoomi nyas seers decide to press ahead with their plan to perform puja at the undisputed site on that day. although ayodhya is a cauldron on the boil, it seems that the onus for maintaining the rule of law will depend mainly on the district officials, mainly the district magistrate and the senior superintendent of police. for them, the state headquarters sent an important message on monday when an arrest warrant was first prepared for the vhp working president ashok singhal and later withdrawn. he was escorted to raj bhawan and then allowed to proceed to ayodhya. after the kind of treatment accorded to singhal in the state capital, will it be fair to expect the faizabad district officials to arrest him in ayodhya, where the home secretary and the director general of police will be conspicuous by their absence on march 15. already, reports from ayodhya suggest that the dm and ssp there may hesitate in taking any action against the temple movement leaders. justifiably so. in 1990 and 92, the district officials were left to deal with the ugly situation and they later paid a price for what was described as their aEUR~laxity'' and incompetence. while the then dgp svm tripathi and the then home secretary played safe and stayed away from the trouble spot, the junior officers had to bear the brunt. from all accounts, the temple movement leaders will enact a face-saving drama on march 15. but just in case the situation goes out of hand, the dm and the ssp apart, there''d be a crying need for the presence of the home secretary and the director-general of police in the pilgrim city on that day, specially when the state is under central rule. executive magistrates, who are not trained in handling law and order situation, would have virtually no role to play. nor will the setting up of make-shift jails have any meaning as was the case in 1990. the detainees in these jails were allowed to go out wherever they wanted for their meals and some people made a lot of money in the process. the home secretary naresh dayal and the dgp rk pandit, despite being aEUR~apprehensive'' about the situation in ayodhya, will be ensconced in the state capital. obviously, they do not believe in leading from the front because of the risks involved. with aEUR~leaders'' like these, is it surprising that the lucknow zone is without an inspector-general even in the time of crisis.	0	0	1	0	0

new delhi: at a time when the vajpayee government is going through a tough time over ayodhya and gujarat, another national democratic alliance member ram vilas paswan has spoken words of dissent.       read this story in...          A A hindi    the lok jan shakti party chief said on tuesday that he would not tie-up with the nda in the next elections in uttar pradesh and bihar. the recent up elections showed that though his party had not garnered too many seats, the voting percentage was good. his party would thus go it alone in the next elections, he said. paswan, who is minister for coal and mines, is also unhappy with the efforts made by the bjp-led coalition in up for a tie-up with mayawati''s bahujan samaj party. he stated firmly that there should be no support to mayawati. echoing other nda allies, paswan asserted that status quo must be maintained in ayodhya. the minister is clearly sore at being divested of the key communications ministry recently. his party, a splinter of the janata dal (u), has four members in the lok sabha. the bjp has already faced censure from another ally the telugu desam party, with leader yerran naidu slamming the narendra modi government in gujarat for its handling of the violence in the state.

"This story is from March 11, 2002  ahmedabad/gandhinagar: is the time ripe for the bjp in gujarat to dissolve the assembly and hold early elections? speculation is rife in political circles that with the voters once again polarised along communal lines and the growing pressure for chief minister narendra modi to resign, the latter may seek the bjp central leadership''s permission to dissolve the assembly rather than just sacrifice the cm''s post. the assembly''s natural life comes to an end in march 2003, which means election would have to be held around january next year. so far it looks like a lost case for the bjp which has been successively losing elections at the panchayat and municipal level, showing its dropping popularity graph. sources close to modi say pressure for the cm''s resignation is likely to grow in the coming week with parliament poised to discuss the gujarat situation and the possibility of some nda allies joining the chorus. according to an official close to the cm, ""modi is very upset with the intense criticism in the media in recent days, but he may turn this into his advantage by saying he is now going back to the people to seek their mandate once again."" state congress president amarsinh choudhary said: ""i have also heard the rumours that the bjp is keen on playing the hindu card, but it will be foolishness because the bjp will only land up losing the opportunity to rule for a few more months."" there was no need for this ''foolishness'', he said, because the congress would come back to power whenever elections are held next in the state. the hardliners in the bjp, however, feel that it would not be able to come back to power on the basis of its performance if the assembly lasted its full term. even in the last three assembly byelections, the bjp could win only rajkot-2 because the cm himself was the candidate. keshubhai was replaced last october only because he could not arrest the downslide of the bjp, culminating in the humiliating defeat in the sabarmati and sabarkantha elections. a section of the bjp has even put out inflated figures like ""winning up to 150 seats"" out of a total of 182 in the assembly polls, if polls are held immediately. the next trial of strength between the congress and the bjp will be in the 70-odd municipality elections which are due on march 31 but these have now been postponed to mid-april. the bjp might like to gauge the mood of the electorate in these elections before taking a decision on holding assembly polls. but the liberals in the bjp are clearly jittery. ministers and mlas belonging to the suresh mehta camp strongly hold the view that post-riots, the bjp might be in for a ""big trouble"". inquiry commissions, judicial and non-judicial, might try to find evidence of the bjp and vhp leaders'' direct or indirect involvement in the riots which would put the party on the defensive at a time it is trying to distance itself from the ayodhya imbroglio. ""firs are already being filed against some bjp leaders. hostile police officials and bureaucrats will proceed on with vengeance. we are in for big trouble,"" said a liberal leader, who is also apprehensive that many liberals might be denied the ticket in this surcharged atmosphere and some more hardliners might be drafted into electoral politics. leader of opposition in the state assembly naresh raval said there might be a ""temporary gain to the bjp""."	0	0	1	0	0

"new delhi: the vajpayee government is building a case for handing over to the ramjanambhoomi nyas at least part aEUR"" if not the entire aEUR"" 67 acres of land in the immediate vicinity of the demolished babri masjid acquired by the centre in december 1992. highly placed sources in the government say that if the acquired land is divided into ""essential"" land aEUR"" needed to maintain the security of the disputed 40x80 feet on which the mosque stood as well as access to it aEUR"" and ""superfluous, excess"" land beyond it, ""there should be no objection"" to handing over the latter to the vhp. not just that, the sources maintain there are provisions in sections 6 and 7 of the acquisition of certain area at ayodhya act, 1993, which entitle the centre to hand over the land to the rjn. the reason why the vhp''s demand is being given such serious consideration is not merely the organisation''s capacity for trouble, but a growing sense in the ranks of the bjp leadership aEUR"" after the party''s abysmal performance in the recent assembly elections aEUR"" that only the revival of the hindutva card can infuse a fresh life into a moribund organisation. at the same time, a section in the government feels that, given the current ""surcharged atmosphere"" in gujarat and elsewhere in the country, this is not the right time to hand over the land, for which the vhp has now announced a fresh deadline of june 2. but the question is: if handing over part or all of the acquired land to the rjn was so simple, why has it not been done thus far? official sources say there are three options on handing over of the land. the first is handing over the ""superfluous"" land as that would still ensure the security and access to the disputed spot. but in 1994, the supreme court, in its advisory opinion on the validity of the acquisition act, had said that not just the fate but the extent of the ""superfluous"" land could only be determined after the title suit for the disputed spot was decided. next comes section 6, which is also being invoked as an option and which, incidentally is the one generally touted by the vhp: that the land can be given to any trust created after 1993, provided it adheres to conditions imposed on it by the government. but the rjn was created well before 1993, and it would be a travesty to hand it over to it even if it floated a fresh trust. not just that, the supreme court had pointed out in 1994 that extra land had been acquired by the centre so that in case the title suit was eventually won by the muslims, ""their success should not be thwarted by denial of proper access to enjoyment of rights in the disputed area by exercise of rights of ownership of hindu owners of the adjacent properties"". and finally section 7, which says that the acquired land can be managed either by the centre or a person/ body of persons/ trust so long as there is no change to the land till the title suit is decided. in short, if the centre invokes section 7 to give the land to the rjn, no construction can begin anyway. related storiesA hand over ayodhya land by june 2: vhpA shankaracharya meets pmA up govt determined not to allow build-up of kar sevaksA babri masjid panel threatens to move scA security to be tightened further in ayodhya    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0

""the issue should be resolved peacefully on the lines of how the somanath temple dispute in gujarat was solved,"" she said. lashing out at the ""so-called secular parties like the congress"", bharti, who is in bangalore to meet vishwesha theertha swamiji of pejawar math, questioned the congress demand for dismissal of the gujarat government. former prime minister rajiv gandhi did not quit office after the massacre following indira gandhi''s assassination in 1984, she recalled. ""in fact, during the riots in which 10,000 sikhs were killed, it was the rss, bjp and vhp combine which protected the innocents. parties like congress which claim to be secular are actually dividing hindus and muslims,"" she said. vishwesha theertha swamiji said incidents such as the godhra carnage should not deter hindu activists from constructing the ram temple at ayodhya. ""we should not lose faith because of such incidents. i appeal to the muslims not to obstruct but allow construction of the temple. such a gesture will help in creating a permanent harmony between hindus and muslims,"" he maintained. stating that the interests of the muslims would not be affected if the ram temple was built, the seer said such a gesture would be reciprocated by the hindus who would come forward to construct a grand mosque elsewhere. he accused ""parties claiming to be secular"" of allegedly trying to instigate muslims who, he claimed, were not opposed to the temple. admar math''s vibhudheesha theertha swamiji advocated mutual respect for places of worship. condemning the godhra incident, balagangadharanatha swamiji of the adichunchunagiri math asked hindus to exercise restraint and maintain peace. constructing the ram temple is the main objective to which the government should respond, he said.

patna: the bharat sadhu samaj on friday accused the vhp of abject surrender on the issue of temple construction at ayodhya by committing itself to adhere to the court''s verdict. ''''the vhp''s abject surrender on the ayodhya issue is under political pressure.....the vhp leaders should desist from misguiding the hindus any further,'''' the bss general secretary, swami harinarayananand, said in a statement here. ''''it (vhp) has played with the sentiments of millions of people as the birthplace of lord rama is only one in the world which cannot be adjudicated, shifted or altered,'''' he said. there was no point in pressing ahead with shilapujan on march 15, he said adding that by its surrender before the prime minister, the vhp has, in one stroke, laid waste all the sacrifices made by hundreds of karsevaks. the swami said since the lucknow bench of the allahabad high court was looking into the title claims between the nirmohi akhara of ayodhya and the sunni-shia board, the vhp should not have come into the picture. he suggested that the matter could best be settled by mutual consent and understanding between the religious leaders of the two communities of ayodhya.

"This story is from March 5, 2002  ahmedabad: special inspector general of police a i saiyed recalls that a few years ago he had inspired residents of the largely muslim village of ganvada in siddhpur taluka of patan district to build a shiva temple because the village didn''t have any temple. he had even organised a grand inauguration of the temple in 1998, inviting all residents of the neighbouring 15 villages. but, last thursday when he was mobbed by about 500 persons at vejalpur in ahmedabad while he was driving to the gujarat police academy, of which he is a joint director, it wasn''t really the opportune time to talk about his contribution to the hindu community. this required some quick thinking because the violent mob had intercepted his official car, complete with a red light on top, two stars which represent his rank as igp and even a police flag! saiyad recalled that he was aware that the situation was tense because of the godhra train massacre the previous day and the fact that the vhp had given a call for bandh on thursday. ""i was confident that nothing would happen. i was in my police uniform and i had an armed commando with me,"" he said. when the driver of his car saw the mob ahead, he suggested to saiyad that they turn back and speed away. but saiyad told him to drive on. that was his mistake. the restive crowd, thinking that he is a senior police official, told him to see that the road leading to juhapura, which had been blocked by residents, is opened. saiyad told them that they should approach the local police for this job as he was with the police academy . then, suddenly, somebody noticed the name tag on his uniform and shouted ""arre aa to saiyad chhe (hey, he is a saiyad)"". on hearing this the mob immediately attacked his car and started stoning his vehicle. the driver showed presence of mind and drove away. saiyad is shaken by the experience but clearly underplays his feelings when he says the incident had ""pinched"" him. he has seen many riots before as an ips officer, even in ahmedabad as a dcp in 1985 and 1992. ""but this was different. its the first time that people saw me as a muslim and not as a police officer who commands a lot of respect in the force,"" he said, the sadness clearly reflected in his voice. he said he had trained nearly 10,000 policemen in gujarat in the police training college in junagadh and now in the police academy besides working in the field as an officer in many districts. asked whether he agreed with the view that the police was sluggish in its response to the riots, he said: ""i''ve read the comments of former dgp m m singh, whom i consider my guru, as saying that the police action was sluggish."" obviously, saiyad didn''t want to comment any further on the issue. he, however, said he was overwhelmed by the anxious inquiries made by his hindu friends about his well-being. ""i''m not afraid of anything even today, but my boys in the academy now insist that they come and pick me up everyday and drop me back home. i find it rather embarrassing because i''m a police officer and i''m capable of protecting not only myself but society,"" he said. nearly 135 of his recruits, who were being trained at the academy, had been despatched to various districts to help police control the situation, he said. ""all that i have told them is to be a human being and remember that they are police officers. their first duty is towards the people irrespective of their caste and religion."""	0	0	1	1	0

""in up"", sharma says, ""the governor has taken a partisan position. he should have gone for floor test which is the best test to ascertain if a party enjoys majority in the legislative assembly or not."" in this case, he says, leader of the largest party wanted the opportunity to prove his majority, which was denied to him. sharma cites two instances when leader of the single largest party not enjoying clear majority was invited to form the government. vajpayee in 1996 and earlier rajiv gandhi in 1989. while vajpayee''s government lasted for 13 days, gandhi declined to form the government. without getting into the legal question, former up governor romesh bhandari says shastri had no option. but he raises another point: ""there is a critical situation in ayodhya, which needs to be handled. there is a apprehension of linkage between the bjp and the vhp. so, it would have been prudent on the part of the governor to invite the single largest party to form the government and prove its majority on the floor of the assembly."" however, bhandari says, president''s rule will not affect the presidential election. ""the new assembly may not have been constituted yet, but it has been notified,"" he says and gives the 1996 example when mlas voted for rajya sabha elections during the president''s rule. ""only the term of assembly will get affected. it will begin from the day the assembly is convened,"" he explains.  Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0

"new delhi: was there a method in the casual manner in which the centre responded to the communal tragedy in gujarat? the vajpayee government received news of the godhra carnage early on february 27. available central paramilitaries in gujarat were put on alert. the pm also cancelled his australia visit. if all this was an indication of how seriously the centre was viewing the unfolding situation, what followed was inexplicable. early on the 28th, reports poured in of mobs targeting muslims throughout gujarat as the police stood by. neither vajpayee, nor union home minister l k advani - whose political base is ahmedabad-gandhinagar - saw fit to instruct their party colleague, narendra modi, to crack down. later that day, vajpayee met rss leaders to discuss not what vhp activists were doing in gujarat but the ayodhya issue; and finally, after some 70 people had been killed, the cabinet committee of security met and decided only to place the army on alert. in the two-day stasis that gripped the union government, defence minister george fernandesaEUR(tm) single-handed sweep through strife-torn gujarat on friday stood out. by all accounts, it was his presence that compelled the gujarat police to initiate action against the mobs beginning friday. in some places, fernandes waded amid hostile crowds and appealed to them to keep the peace. itaEUR(tm)s not clear why the defence minister felt compelled to do the home ministeraEUR(tm)s job in the latteraEUR(tm)s constituency. the events in gujarat are a macabre replay of the november 1984 massacre of the sikhs. then, as now, terrible ""revenge"" is being visited on innocents for the heinous act of some members of their community. then, as now, the delay in the response appears deliberate: to allow hoodlums to aEUR~aEUR~punishaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) the community. rajivaEUR(tm)s infamous remark about the earth shaking when a big tree falls, has been echoed by modi: ""the people of gujarat have observed restraint in the wake of grave provocation"". in 1984, the civilian authorities refused to call in the army till thousands of sikhs were killed. in gujarat, the union government claims aEUR~aEUR~there were no army columns in or around ahmedabadaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) for immediate deployment. considering that the state bordering pakistan has a especially heavy deployment of the army, this excuse does not quite wash.

new delhi: the vhp international working president ashok singhal held talks with rss leaders sunday morning as part of the ongoing efforts to end the impasse in ayodhya. rss joint general secretary in-charge of bjp affairs madan das devi and his colleague s v seshadri briefed singhal at the jhandewalan headquarters about their talks with prime minister atal bihari vajpayee and home minister l k advani here saturday evening, sangh sources said. the leaders also discussed the current situation in gujarat and ayodhya. the rss, which is mediating between the vhp and the government on the issue, had announced saturday that hindu religious leaders would be meeting vajpayee and advani in a day or two and a solution satisfactory to both sides would be found. vajpayee had sought the rss intervention in the wake of the godhra killings and vhp''s threat to shift the carved pillars to the ram janambhoomi site on march 15. meanwhile, vhp sources said vajpayee has invited the religious leaders for talks on wednesday. the vhp also denied media reports that the outfit had called an emergency meeting of its leaders sunday which was subsequently cancelled following the death of lok sabha speaker g m c balayogi in a helicopter crash in andhra pradesh. vhp spokesman vireshwar dwivedi had saturday asserted that the outfit would go ahead with its march 15 plan and had sought a written assurance from vajpayee that the government would allow the programme and return within three months the land belonging to it and acquired by the government and lift restrictions in ayodhya. related stories:A british national visiting gujarat killedA gujarat riots: the story so farA A A full coverageA has the govt done enough?A A A A A pray for peace    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail	0	0	0	0	0

"ahmedabad: that the common muslim in ahmedabad was fully at the mercy of the mauraders is well-known. but the death of dance did not spare even top judges, sitting and retired, and police officers either. let the events described below speak for themselves.       read this story in...          A A hindi    justice m h kadri is a sitting judge of the gujarat high court. he is the only male member in his house and his family includes his 85-year-old bedridden mother. justice kadri lives in his official quarters at dhulia court near law garden in the heart of the city. as riots broke out, justice kadri was tipped off that a mob could attack his house and that the two security guards at his gate would be unable to stop the mob. apparently, calls for more armed guards were made to the director general of police and the additional chief secretary (home) for more armed guards. what transpired is not known, but justice kadri was forced to move out. chief justice of gujarat, d dharmadhikari, suggested that justice kadri move in to his official bunglow, but the latter preferred to move in with some relatives. after witnessing rioting firsthand around his relatives'' home, justice kadri had to go to live with another judge of the high court for a day. all with his bed-ridden mother. fortunately, his family was unharmed. another respected judge of the city, justice akbar n divecha, also had a torrid experience. justice divecha who served the gujarat high court, retired in new delhi as chairman of the mrtp commission. he now heads a commission of inquiry appointed by the surpeme court of india. after retirement, justice divecha returned to make ahmedabad his home. but last thursday he became homeless. his house, in the kazima flats in the paldi area of the city, was attacked and burnt down. justice divecha managed to escape just in the nick of time and thus saved from any personal injury. on monday he went back to survey his burnt house. of course, with military escort. there is little left of what was his home.

"This story is from March 9, 2002  vadodara: if the september 11 attacks last year induced the fear of flying among passengers in the us, the recent burning of the sabarmati express at godhra has done just the reverse in gujarat. travel agencies and airlines'' offices here report a distinct shift in people''s preference from the railways to airlines, say travel agencies and airlines. in the past week, travel agents have cancelled several train bookings and got them booked on airlines, which seems to have become the favoured mode of travel under prevailing circumstances. while the travel trade, at large, has been affected by the riots, the airlines industry is booming with business. says purvi thakar, a travel consultant at karlson wagonlit, ""in the first few days after the sabarmati express attack, several bookings were postponed. but now, we are operating at full capacity with our clients demanding to be rebooked as soon as possible, and most are demanding to be booked on airlines."" according to neha buch, a customer service agent at jet airways, the last few days have seen a steep rise in bookings. ""people seem to be feeling insecure to travel by train and we are flooded with booking orders. currently, all flights are choc-a-bloc and we are working 15 hours a day trying to meet this rush,"" she says. ""even businessmen from anand and halol, who have to catch international flights from mumbai and new delhi, prefer flying to trains."" people from the trade also say that personal travel plans have been shelved and clients are hesitant to move out of the city, unless mandatory. says jayendrasinh jhala of transline tours & travels: ""there has been a 60 to 70 per cent drop in bookings. even short distance travel plans are being cancelled. on the upside, however, there has been a 25 per cent rise in air bookings in the past four days. almost all flights are packed."" one of the reasons for flights being completely full is that executives leaving city on deputation or to attend conferences can''t delay their plans any further. goraiswamy gopinathan, managing director at narmada travels, agrees that there has been an almost 30 per cent rise in air ticketing. ""this is because people are still afraid of night journeys in trains, as the situation is volatile,"" he says. ""but this is only a temporary phase. in a few days rail travel is likely to pick up and be at par."" but some feel that this is only a temporary phase. president of travel agents federation of india (tfai) gujarat chapter, bharat shah, however, says that the rush was felt only in the first few days and there is no specific inclination to air travel, any more. ""it was only a reaction to the riots. the travel patterns are more or less the usual,"" he says. helping air travel in the region is the presence of the golden corridor, that network of small towns around vadodara with their bustling industrial activity. these factories and engineering sheds can''t afford to remain shut for more than a couple of days, especially in these recession-hit days."	0	0	0	0	0

"This story is from March 5, 2002  ahmedabad: february 22, 7.50 pm: the ahmedabad railway station in kalupur area resounded with chants of ''har har mahadev'' playing on a loudspeaker. kar sevaks of all ages crowded around the sabarmati express ready for departure with very little baggage. some of them were chanting ''jai shri ram'' accompanied by cymbals. the train was flagged off amid a surge of saffron. february 27: the train we had nearly seen off, carrying old women and ram sevaks, enroute jaipur, was singed and spoke of bloodshed at godhra. by saturday, a deathly calm followed... the return from jaipur was quite an irony. the usually crowded railway station was bare with a couple of residents awaiting relatives and moving about like zombies. travelling by the ahmedabad-bound ashram express from delhi was never so difficult - this time the problem was not a crowded train, but vacant coaches and easily available reservations. when the train chugged out of jaipur station, the lone coolie on this platform cautioned: ""aap jaa to rahe ho ... hame bolna nahi chahiye per jaana thik nahi hai (you are going so i should not speak like this, but its not safe to go there now)"". pointing at the empty platform number 1, he said, ""you would not find an inch of space to put your feet."" ironically, there were hardly any people to board one of the most crowded train on saturday night. once inside the coach, the ticket examiner seemed quite hassled. he answered an anxious passenger, who wanted to know whether there were more passengers or not. he showed a blank passenger list, with a few names dotting the page. ""no one travels at such a time ... not to a place like ahmedabad at least,"" replied an amdavadi who had boarded the train. soon a conversation breaks among the passengers and everyone asks each other the purpose of travelling. ""why are you going to ahmedabad? people go away from gujarat,"" remarked a fellow passenger to another who was asking for directions to reach a friend''s place in the burning city. the train stops a little outside jaipur. ""yaar rajasthan hai tab tak thik hai, gujarat me mat khadi karna warna kriya karam bhi vahin ho jayega...,"" quips another amid nervous laughter. some decided to call it a day and steal a few snores till the rajasthan border ended. but not for long. a couple of hours later the train arrives at ajmer and tension is writ large on everyone''s face. the station was clogged with frenzied families from the minority community that had left ahmedabad to save themselves from mob frenzy, perhaps seeking shelter at the khwaja moinuddin chisti''s dargah. ""hundreds of them have come here in last three days,"" a constable standing guard at the coach shows the platforms of ajmer station with barely any space to crouch. some of the passengers run to board the train and the doors are instantly slammed. portals open reluctantly only after tickets are shown. the other coaches are urgently sealed as railway cops patrol the coaches and count and re-count the number of passengers. presence of members of another community with women and children, turns everyone quiet and uneasy. a sigh of relief is heaved soon as they board a nearby coach. the famous ajmeri ''rabdi'' is forgotten and there are no vendors either. all that resounds in this station are cacophonic announcements about this train bound for ahmedabad. the arrival at ahmedabad was a chilly reminder of the reality. burnt buildings, suspicious people on sides of the rail tracks and more coolies than passengers. a city gone unrecognisable in one week.

"new delhi: going by pakistan''s official tv channel, ptv, the riots in gujarat are still in full fury and people are still being massacred and the anarchy that was unleashed in gujarat on february 27th and 28th, still reigns. the ministry of external affairs here has been monitoring the news reports on the channel and according to a senior official, the tactic is quite simple. every day when reports on gujarat are telecast, specially during the afternoon news bulletin, clippings of the riots during the first and second day are shown, making them appear live and latest. ""we have proof to show that shots of deserted streets in kerala have been passed off as clips of gujarat during the bandh call that was given by the vhp last month,"" says the official. incidentally, this is happening when president pervez musharraf during his televised address thursday to saarc ministers of information & broadcasting assembled at islamabad, said that he is open to criticism from the media, ""provided the news is correct."" this is not the first time that the ptv has been accused of false propaganda by india. i&b officials say that ptv has stage-managed burning of mosques that have been passed of as being destroyed in india. sources in the i&b ministry, however, say that that though all efforts are being made to counter false propaganda carried out by ptv, there are no immediate plans to ban the state-sponsored channel. ""further, it is within the power of any state administration to ban ptv if they so desire as per the cable tv act,"" says an official. the central monitoring service, under the information & broadcasting ministry, regularly monitors content of different television and radio channels. the indian government has stepped up its efforts to counter the propaganda war carried out by ptv. in the last few months, given the indo-pak tension on the borders, doordarshan has come out with specific programmes to counter ptvs anti-india propaganda. programmes such as ptv-saach kya hai, counters anti-india comments made by pakistan state television. these are five-minute clippings, aired thrice a week. another programme, pakistan reporter, a half-hour show, throws light on events happening inside pakistan. related stories:A pak propaganda on j&k continues to filter in    Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0

the bjp's debacle in up and uttaranchal has proved once again that the loyalty of its voters cannot be taken for granted. if the seats of the two assemblies and the party positions in them are combined, the bsp and the congress, followed by the sp, emerge as the real gainers. in terms of percentage representation in the assemblies, the bsp raised it from 15 per cent to 22, while the congress from 8 per cent to 13. the corresponding figures for sp are 25 and 30. thus, while all three gained, the bjp lost sizably. from about 41 per cent in undivided up, it barely managed about 27 per cent, that too after adding its allies. how does one explain the rout of this 'party with a difference'? the caste arithmetic theory provides only a partial answer, if any. the real causes are, one, that the bjp could not appreciate the impact of modernity, which was making people impatient for palpable results, and two, it continued to believe that for indians, caste and religious considerations received precedence over their developmental needs. consequently, it could neither read the real meaning of the creation of three new states -- although it supported their creation -- nor throw off the hindutva baggage, which it knew had become a liability. behind the creation of uttaranchal, jharkhand and chhattisgarh, there was an acute sense of relative deprivation, not ethnicity. similarly, no hindu required vhp's homily to be proud of his faith. for most of them, a ram temple at ayodhya was okay, not something they could not live without -- particularly if it consumed so much of the states' energy, which could have otherwise been productively used. it is a pity that the bjp top brass understood it but could not rise to the occasion. following the godhra incident, home minister l k advani now talks of leashing the vhp, but it may be too late. post 9/11 the world has changed which means a no-nonsense approach to religious extremism. the bjp's turning a blind eye to the hindutva brigades' christian bashing or its rowdy acts against valentine day enthusiasts have evidently not enthused voters. making a bonfire of valentine cards may make a front-page story in a newspaper but cannot gloss the fact that the same newspaper carries four pages of classified valentine messages. the party has lost touch with the reality of our youths. when conventional courses like history, sociology and political science are going abegging in universities for enrolment as most students are opting for management and technical courses, the party is wasting time rewriting indian history and introducing astrology courses. it is anachronism par excellence. if the bjp wants to regain its initiative it would have to change its rhetoric first. but the problem is that when a leopard changes its stripes, it does not remain a leopard. and that is the bjp's predicament.

""we are not in the picture. it is definitely the responsibility of the courier company to inform the airline that the cargo contained signalling flares,"" he said. however, he did not know the name of the courier company. in mumbai, director of kalba marine services private limited s.s.bal said he was unaware that jaisu shipping corporation was despatching flares. ""we have been working with them for the last seven years and this is the first time that such a thing has happened,"" he said. according to him it was not a ""serious problem"" since the items were only signalling flares used in ships. since the incident has taken place even as communal tension still prevails in gujarat, representatives of the intelligence bureau as well as aviation security officials said they were probing it from all angles. bcas deputy commissioner sushovan banerjee said if an organisation transported dangerous goods without informing the airline, it constituted a serious ""breach of procedure. we will be conducting an investigation to ascertain the nature of the explosives"", he said. mr bedi and mr banerjee have rushed to rajkot to investigate the security lapse."	0	0	1	0	0

This story is from March 25, 2002  vadodara: the additional supply of power from madhya pradesh, chhatisgarh and maharashtra has helped the gujarat electricity board (geb) ease restrictions on the use of power by industries and rural areas in the state. geb has extended the period of lifting restrictions on the use of power by non-continuous processing industries in the state to april 8 from march 25. with the wheat season getting over, the demand for power from the farm sector in madhya pradesh has considerably gone down. moreover, there is no heavy demand from the industries either which has resulted in the availability of surplus power. this coupled with the cash-starved madhya pradesh state electricity board, which will find it difficult to pay for drawing more power from national thermal power corporation (ntpc). chhatisgarh, a power surplus state, too has no problem in supplying more power to gujarat. even maharashtra state electricity board is facing a cash crunch and has restricted power procurement from ntpc. all these factors have worked in favour of gujarat which enables the state to draw up to 500 mw of additional power from the central sector units. so geb, which is facing the acute problem of capacity shortage due to increased demand for power, is in favour of drawing additional power from ntpc units. with the onset of summer, the unrestricted demand for power has gone up to more than 8,500 mw in the state.	0	0	0	0	0

new delhi: the supreme courtaEUR(tm)s order vacating the ban on the implementation of the new national curriculum may have come as a reprieve for students and teachers. till friday they faced the prospects of having to sit in class without textbooks in the new academic session. but the plea on which the ncert got stay vacated - crores have been spent and 25 lakh textbooks have already been printed - does not seem true. sources in ncert refute this contention. according to them, the council is in a tizzy. till two days ago the manuscript of the ancient india textbook for class vi (to replace romilla thaparaEUR(tm)s book) hadnaEUR(tm)t been finalised. the council was still debating whether to introduce a section on ramayana and mahabharata and include pictures of the kumbh mela. according to a publisher involved with the new books, the ncertaEUR(tm)s claim that 25 lakh books are ready is highly exaggerated. as for history, eight copies of new textbooks were hurriedly bound together in case the court asked for it. fortunately it did not. says arjun dev, former ncert professor, aEUR~aEUR~the ncert seems to have played a fraud. considering that the new syllabus was approved only on january 21, 2002, 25 lakh books could not have been produced so fast, unless some private publishers were given access to the new syllabus, for a consideration, and they started printing, even before it was officially approved.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) the ncert has to produce 95 new textbooks for various subjects. according to the affidavit submitted to the court by the ncert, 15 titles are ready, for another 15, the print order have been given, and for 18-20 more, the manuscripts are ready. that leaves 45 books under preparation. aEUR~aEUR~given the ncertaEUR(tm)s complete loss of credibility, one is not sure what these books are,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says prof dev.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says b g verghese, one of the petitioners of the pil (the other two are social activist and magasasay award winner aruna roy and sociologist meena tyabji), aEUR~aEUR~the courtaEUR(tm)s order is a victory for us, the stay on the substantiative part continues. the 25 lakh books, the ncert claims are ready, can remain in the warehouse till the matter is finally settled.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) what if the court verdict goes against the ncert, wonaEUR(tm)t it be a colossal waste? aEUR~aEUR~why were the ncert and private publishers in such an indecent haste. they should suffer the consequences, he argues. what if the case drags on for years like ayodhya? aEUR~aEUR~it wonaEUR(tm)t, itaEUR(tm)s in nobodyaEUR(tm)s interest,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says verghese. adds prof dev, aEUR~aEUR~meanwhile, they can continue with the old books because technically the ban is on implementing the new curriculum, not on the existing one.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) school principals are not too worried about having to do without textbooks for history, hindi, etc. as jyoti bose, principal, springdales, puts it: aEUR~aEUR~our teaching is not dependent on textbooks, they are at best an aid and guide. we will teach what we want to, doesnaEUR(tm)t matter which book they prescribe.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) then what is all this fuss about?

"This story is from March 25, 2002  ahmedabad: former chief minister madhavsinh solanki recalls a debate in parliament in the late 1970s when morarji desai was the prime minister and he was being castigated by the then congress mp vasant sathe on the riots in mumbai that had killed over 100 people. solanki, an mp from gujarat at that time, says desai explained that while the human toll was quite high, all the violence had taken place in just one-and-a-half hours after which peace was restored. ""when modi says he controlled everything in 72 hours, he is not realising that this is too long a period to restore order,"" he says. ""time is a big factor in controlling such situations,"" says the former chief minister. but over three weeks or over 500 hours now after modi made that famous remark, just take a look around gujarat and one will find signs of the ''control'' he is talking about. the toll in the violence is now close to the 800 mark and killings have become a day-to-day affair in the state with virtually no signs of a let-up. the icing on the cake is, of course, modi''s statement in rajkot on saturday where he blamed the statements made by ''non-secular'' parties in delhi which, he says, are stoking the violence in gujarat. neither the chief minister nor any member of his council of ministers has provided a reassuring face to the strife-torn society of gujarat. in fact, even bjp ministers, who have been elected from constituencies in ahmedabad, are afraid of venturing out into the muslim-dominated areas or at least pay a visit to the various relief camps which - as the violence enters the fourth week - still house thousands of refugees. instead, in the state assembly on friday, a senior minister of the modi cabinet, fakir vaghela, unabashedly blamed the muslims for attacking the dalits during the riots. while another minister, karsan patel, recalled the rss resolution in bangalore recently where it was stated that the muslims could feel secure only with the goodwill of the hindus. violence has now entered the fourth week and since march 15, when the ram shila daan took place in ayodhya, some 25 people have been killed in gujarat. modi knows timing is of paramount importance. even when he took over as chief minister in october 2001, he had made it clear that he was here to play a one-day international and not a five-day test match. it is indeed baffling then that the chief minister has allowed things to drift in the last couple of weeks when he should have been putting into place an effective law and order machinery by replacing some of the officials who have sullied the name of the entire police force. instead, if anybody has been targeted, it is a handful of police officers who thought their call of duty was more important than the signals from the political leadership. the continuing bouts of violence in ahmedabad and vadodara and some of the smaller towns show a complete break-down in the law and order machinery and loss of faith in the administration. countless number of muslims, many of them in government and corporate jobs, are planning to leave the borders of the state at the first given opportunity. if the government had hoped that ''riot fatigue'' would set in, then it hasn''t. there are fears that there is a deliberate attempt to keep the burning embers of communalism alive for political gains. even the national human rights commission chairman, justice j s verma, was forced to think out aloud why normalcy had not been restored so far."	0	0	1	0	0

new delhi: the bjp-led government attributed its aEUR~aEUR~successaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) in ensuring peaceful passage of the day in ayodhya on friday to two factors: the attorney generalaEUR(tm)s submission in the supreme court, and a cabinet secretariat official heading the ayodhya cell, shatrughan singh, receiving the shila from ramchandra paramhans in ayodhya. aEUR~aEUR~i canaEUR(tm)t say we have made any gains, but we have made no losses either,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) a senior minister said. clearly, the symbolism of the countryaEUR(tm)s seniormost law officer pleading the vhp case, and the pmaEUR(tm)s representative facilitating shila daan went some way towards appeasing the vhp/rjn, and made a climbdown in the scale and nature of the ceremony possible. government sources said singh was deputed to receive the shila after it was realised that faizabad commissioner anil guptaaEUR(tm)s receiving it might be interpreted as violative of the apex court ruling. gupta is the official receiver and custodian of the acquired land. besides, gupta had become a hate figure with the vhp/rjn as he had imposed the curbs in the town, and paramhans wanted aEUR~aEUR~someone importantaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) from delhi to receive the shila which will now be in the custody of the faizabad district administration till the title suit is decided. but the isi and caste factors also seem to have helped. the vhp appears to have been persuaded into recognising that there was a serious threat from isi-backed terrorists and unless the ceremony build-up was reduced, the terrorists might aEUR~aEUR~infiltrateaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) its ranks, cause trouble and damage its image. as for the caste factor, not just external affairs minister jaswant singh and former up chief minister rajnath singh but even former prime minister chandra shekhar was roped in to persuade paramhans, a thakur, to withdraw his suicide threat. at the end of the day, the pm telephoned governor vishnu kant shastri to congratulate him for his handling of the issue and expressed his appreciation of the state administration in controlling the situation in ayodhya and the state. but this clearly is not the end of the story. the vhp wants kar sewaks to go to ayodhya on march 24 for the conclusion of the purnahuti yagya.

"ahmedabad/vadodara: after purchasing hockey sticks and baseball bats to save their homes and hearths, the hapless majority community of gujarat has been reduced to wearing religion on their sleeves. overnight, homes, shops and business establishments have sprouted posters that announce which community the owner and proprieter belongs to. jai shri ram and posters of hindu gods have now become tickets to survival for those who live in mixed localities. the precaution is well thought of. when rioters started burning shops in ahmedabad, owner of mehfil restaurant could not help cursing himself. in a last ditch attempt, he put a board outside his shop, which said: aEUR~aEUR~jai shri ram. proprietor-partner rg singh and balwant singh.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) mehfil still stands intact. on the main samjuba hospital road of bapunagar, the all-glass bajaj showroom was spared only because of shri ram written prominently on the glass. the phenomenon is most pronounced in naroda-patia, where hindus and muslims live cheek-by- jowl in a labyrinth of shanties. since the gruesome massacre of february 27 in which 75 people were killed, only a handful of hindu families remain. the fear of being caught in the crossfire drove away the rest. those who stay have no option; and they are letting the world know they are hindus. there is no way one can miss a hindu home here. the difference is marked. houses bedecked with posters of gods and goddesses stand intact amid blackened shells that were once homes. elsewhere, while aEUR~aEUR~jai shri ramaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) is the most favoured mantra to survival, a combination of vegetables, apparently, does the trick as well. in fact, as the riots ended, many shopkeepers sprinted for chillies and lemon aEUR"" a time-tested combination to hang outside shops. garments shops along c g road aEUR"" with names that could raise an eyebrow aEUR"" all sported strings of chillies hanging at the entrance like so many wind chimes. the humble mango leaf is suddenly in demand as well. after an automobile showroom on the sarkhej-gandhinagar highway was burnt down, satnambhai, despite lacking a specific name for his shop, lined the entrance of his garage with mango leaves. others have fallen back on simple symbols. fresh swastikas, the symbolic om and jai shri ganesh surfaced overnight on rusted shutters of mechanics and greengrocers at naroda, bapunagar and memnagar. in vadodara, a number of houses have ram inscribed on doors and shopkeepers have hung boards proclaiming: aEUR~aEUR~this shop belongs to a hinduaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). others have resorted to decorating doorways with coconuts on a kalash near their doorsteps. in karelibaug, even housing societies have pasted posters of hindu gods and goddesses at the main gates.

""i would expect normal traffic to resume only four to six weeks after normalcy returns and by the time we recoup our losses it would be another 12 months,"" adds cama. cinema halls and multiplexes wear a deserted look, too. according to multiplex and theatre owners, the reason is more because of the distributors refusing to take the risk of releasing new movies. the state has seen no new releases in the past one month. city pulse, which used to do a business of around rs 30-40 lakh per month is actually losing rs 50,000 to 75,000 per day. occupancy levels are down to less than 10 per cent, according to ashok purohit of city pulse darshak mehta, head of fun republic, says business is down by half.

This story is from March 31, 2002  new delhi: prime minister vajpayee''s gujarat visit next week may spell the beginning of the end of narendra modi''s dispensation in the state, well placed sources in the government say. continued violence even after his delhi visit, his defiant demeanour and his shooting from the hip at the media, the political opposition and even parliament have made modi''s position untenable, these sources point out. though unofficial, the announcement of vajpayee''s visit a week in advance has acquired political significance. the message is that the pm has decided to ignore the pressures from the sangh parivar to retain modi despite the allegations of partisan performance of his government machinery. for starters, the centre may ask governor s s bhandari to send a report on the situation in gujarat to begin, belatedly, the constitutional process. that this has not been done for over a month has not been lost sight of by political observers and constitutional experts familiar with past actions of the union government of the day. for the ruling bjp, which initially saw gujarat as a testing ground for hindutva, the charge of there being a nexus between the violence and the movement for the ram temple in ayodhya is embarrassing for its long-term plans. that violence has spread to the rural areas is seen in official circles as something unprecedented and a dangerous trend. a change of guard in gujarat is seen in bjp circles as a way to remove an unpopular chief minister and replace him with somebody more acceptable to do the fire-fighting required for the elections next year. modi''s performance has embarrassed the government, which earlier this week had to take note of british foreign secretary jack straw''s statement. although diplomatically worded to refer only to two missing british nationals, the statement did cover the need for communal harmony and for peace. sources in the opposition and even within the ruling nda point to the gross incongruity in the centre''s constitutional behaviour. that the same party (bjp) dominates the government at the centre and runs the government in gujarat, coupled with a senior member of the sangh parivar holding the gubernatorial post, has permitted a measure of political sanguinity that has now become the talking point in political circles. for instance, it is pointed out that even when the congress enjoyed power at the centre and in the states, at times with senior partymen in the raj bhavans - a situation misused to political advantage by all concerned on numerous occasions - violence of a political nature, so widespread and ferocious and so prolonged, was never permitted. according to durga das basu''s treatise on the constitution, article 356 was utilised precisely a 100 times till 1997 and since then, another five times. defections, either local or organised from delhi, altered the numbers in the legislatures to cause constitutional breakdowns in several cases. but in a majority of the cases, such breakdowns caused law and order situations that needed to be quelled by imposing president''s rule. gujarat itself has had four spells of president''s rule. the last one in 1996 saw then governor krishna pal singh dismissing the bjp government a day after it proved its majority support on the floor of the house and installing the congress-supported government of shankersinh vaghela. the outcome of this experiment was that the bjp romped home with a two-third majority in 1998.	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 24, 2002  vadodara: the gujarat electricity board (geb) has increased the hours of single-phase power supply to rural areas in view of the ssc and hsc examinations. rural areas have been getting enhanced supply from march 18. geb sources told tnn that rural areas are now getting single-phase power supply for 10 hours, up from the earlier six hours. restriction on single-phase electricity supply to rural areas were imposed because it was found that electricity is being misused, the sources said. a large number of consumers converted it into three-phase for irrigation purposes and drawing more water from the wells. there were allegations that the converted power was used to draw more water and sell it in the drought-hit areas. due to the prevailing situation in various parts of the state, the geb had decided to ease some restrictions on the use of power and lifted the evening power-cut in towns and load-shedding in rural areas. these restrictions were imposed in november.	0	0	0	0	0
"new delhi: with central observer shatrughan singh accepting the shila (carved stone) from ramjanmbhoomi nyas president mahant ramchandradas paramhans outside the acquired land, the imminent threat in ayodhya may have been defused, but tempers are only rising in the capital's political circles. opposition parties are objecting to the participation of a government official in a religious ceremony. describing singh's participation as ""a very important development,"" opposition parties have said that such things should not happen in a secular state. accusing the vajpayee government of pandering to the vishwa hindu parishad's agenda, opposition leaders say that the issue is likely to affect parliament proceedings, with all opposition parties voicing concerns. shatrughan singh, who was the government's appointee to receive the shila from the mahants, may not be the statutory receiver of the 67.7 acres of government-acquired land, but is still a government official. moreover, as the head of the ayodhya cell attached to the prime minister's office, his presence was seen as a direct extension of the pm himself. senior cpi(m) leader somnath chatterjee confirmed a united opposition would take up the matter in house. the congress too criticised the acceptance of the shila by a senior government official. ""while the congress welcomes the fact that the law of the land has prevailed in ayodhya, one fails to understand the role of a government official in a purely religious function,"" said congress spokesperson jaipal reddy. while the authorities have argued that accepting the shila outside the acquired land would not violate the supreme court orders of march 13, the opposition is seeing the participation of government officials as capitulation to the vhp's obduracy. congress president sonia gandhi on friday made a blistering attack on the government in the lok sabha on the ayodhya issue charging it with openly collaborating with vhp in the wake of threat of ""dire consequences"" from bjp mps. meanwhile, the government, expectedly, received words of praise from both the bjp and the rss. the bjp praised mahant ramchandra das paramhans for abiding by the sc verdict which disallowed symbolic puja at the undisputed site in ayodhya. bjp spokesperson v k malhotra said, ""despite all attempts to provoke him, the paramhans stuck to the law of the land."" the bjp also praised the government for ensuring that the situation stayed under control. ""the party now wants that the ayodhya issue should be solved through dialogue between the hindus and the muslims. the bjp will welcome the role of the shankaracharya as well as the muslim personal law board,"" malhotra said. the rss went a step ahead, consequent to the shila daan ceremony. it has now said that the entire disputed land should be handed over to the ramjanambhoomi nyas for temple construction. earlier in the day, commenting on the government decision to appoint the faizabad divisional commissioner as the receiver of the shila, somnath chatterjee wrote to the pm, saying: ""it is highly objectionable that a government official and particularly one who is representing the statutory receiver appointed by the court, should participate in such a ceremony which, even if held outside the area mentioned by the supreme court, will be against the spirit of the order."" chatterjee also said in the letter: ""if such a donation is accepted, then it is nothing but the government taking part in a religious ceremony which has become extremely controversial."" he requested vajpayee to issue ""appropriate instructions that no government official should take part in any such ceremony or function."" related stories sc judgements:  Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail"	0	0	0	0	0

"This story is from March 17, 2002  ahmedabad: the state government on saturday decided to postpone the ssc and hsc board examinations in the commissionerate areas of ahmedabad and vadodara which were scheduled to start from march 18. fresh dates will be announced shortly by state education minister anandiben patel. the decision has been taken in view of the recent disturbances in the two cities and the distinct view of the district administration and police that it will be extremely difficult to provide security to all examinees under such a situation. earlier on friday, the government had announced that while examinations would be held as per schedule from march 18, those who are not in a position to take the exams next week would be given another option of appearing in the alternate exams scheduled from may 6. however, following pressure from parents and politicians of the ruling bjp, a decision to postpone the exams has been taken in the urban areas of ahmedabad and vadodara. however, exams would begin, as scheduled, in other areas of the state from monday. altogether, about one million students are scheduled to take the examinations and there were apprehensions that while the situation was not at all conducive in many areas, many students had lost their books and belongings in the riots and were not able to study in temporary relief camps. the state had earlier come up with the compromise formula of holding two exams - one from march 18 and the other from may 6. but in the wake of violence breaking out in the city on friday, the state finally gave in and postponed the exams till a further date. the fresh dates will be announced after reviewing how the situation remains when the exams begin on march 18, highly-placed sources in the secretariat told tnn. in all probability, the exams will be scheduled in the second week of april, sources indicated. students who were supposed to write exams in centres in sensitive areas of the city like shahpur, dariapur, gomtipur, bapunagar and juhapura have heaved a sigh of relief. ""i am happy that the exams have been postponed. i was very scared to go to the exam centre at gomtipur. now, i hope that the situation will cool down and we will be able to write the exams in peace,"" said shveta shah, a standard 10 student of saraspur. jinal kanani too was happy that she was spared the torture of having to go to gomtipur to write her ssc exams. but there is a catch here. jinal''s uncle kamlesh bhavsar said that while the postponing of exams is a welcome decision, this is definitely not the end of the problem. ""our main opposition was giving the exam centre in gomtipur. the exams will be postponed by 10 days or a maximum of 15 days. but the situation is not going to improve by then. if our children are given the same centre, we will oppose and will not refrain from moving the court,"" said bhavsar. meanwhile, demands have been pouring in to postpone exams in other areas of the state as well. the gujarat pradesh youth congress (gpyc) has demanded that exams should also be postponed in panchmahals, bharuch, balasinore, chhota udepur and other parts of the state which were equally affected by riots and continue to re-main tense. ""students in these areas were as much affected by riots as their counterparts in ahmedabad and vadodara and the exams should be postponed there as well,"" said manish doshi of gpyc."	0	0	1	0	0

"This story is from March 25, 2002  gandhinagar: chief minister narendra modi is deliberately delaying a formal decision on the issue of forming an all-party committee under the chairmanship of gujarat governor s s bhandari for rehabilitating over one lakh riot victims staying in 100-odd camps, despite a formal communiquaEURs to this effect from prime minister vajpayee. ten days after vajpayee made the announcement in the lok sabha, the lack of any follow-up on an issue of such urgency comes as a surprise. there have been several queries from the prime minister''s office (pmo) and raj bhavan. however, according to sources, the cm has not yet responded to the queries. the sources said the governor too wasn''t very keen on the formation of the all-party committee and hasn''t adopted a proactive approach to the issue, knowing that he could become the target of the opposition parties once the committee starts functioning. though the pmo sent an official note to the chief minister''s office and the raj bhavan several days ago, the cm is yet to formally request bhandari to form the committee, on which the future of thousands of displaced families hinges. ""the note sent to the cm is accompanied by the proceedings of parliament, where the pm announced the need to form the committee,"" an official said. ""the cm now just needs to send a one-line request to raj bhavan to go ahead with formation of the committee."" insiders say the file to form the committee through a formal notification has been pending with the cm for several days now. modi reportedly wants some ''pliable'' congress leaders in the committee, whereas the congress is insisting on its discretion on who to nominate to the panel. the issue also figured at the meeting of senior congress leaders at sonia gandhi''s at 10 janpath residence on friday night and the aicc president is said to have told partymen that she would take up the matter with vajpayee once again. the cm''s unwillingness to act on forming the committee comes despite his formal assurance to opposition leader naresh raval in the state assembly last wednesday that the latter would be part of the committee. raval had sought to find out when the committee would be formed. both the cmo and raj bhavan officials have now adopted a ""we don''t know"" posture. sources say never before has it happened that despite the pm''s direction, the gujarat government has treated a matter so callously. liberals within the bjp point out that any more delay in rehabilitation work would deteriorate the law and order situation further. ""the need for the formation of the committee is particularly important because the riot victims staying in relief camps are unwilling to go back to their homes,"" an official said. at the same time, there is a section in the bjp, led by the food and civil supplies minister bharat barot, who feel that the relief camps should be wound up as they had the potential to create trouble for the neighbourhood. this section feels that the all-party committee would dictate the agenda on rehabilitation which should be left to the government."	0	0	0	0	0

"This story is from March 27, 2002  ahmedabad: miffed with the recent transfer of police officials by the state government when communal tensions are yet to die down, the ips officers'' association of gujarat has decided to call a general body meeting to protest against the placement of non-cadre officers in cadre posts. highly placed sources in the police department told tnn that the recent transfers, which jolted certain officers holding important posts before the expiry of their term, has sent wrong signals down the cadre at a time when the police are already facing flak for their role in the recent communal flare-up. president of the association rn bhattacharya confirmed to tnn that ""many officers had telephoned me suggesting that a general body meeting which is long overdue, be held soon"". a large section of the ips officers are believed to be against the ad hoc postings of 10 officers, who have been promoted from the deputy superintendent of police ranks. some of them occupy cadre posts like in the case of sg trivedi. trivedi, who takes over as sp of the sensitive kutch district, will supersede sm katara, who despite being his senior, will report to him as additional superintendent in the same district, police officers point out. ""this is against the norms and will become a bad precedent,"" said a senior ips officer from gandhinagar. the fact that ad hoc postings have become a way with the home department has further fuelled the resentment. interestingly, an unsigned rejoinder from the state government justifies these postings on the grounds that ""this practice was on for a long time and keeping important posts of sps vacant during this turbulent period would be against public interest and hence there were ad hoc postings."" the rejoinder also describes as ""baseless"" the newspaper reports which had attributed reasons, in the interest of the present establishment to the transfers. incidentally, the general body of the ips officers'' association has not met for the last three years."	0	0	1	0	0
"This story is from March 18, 2002  ahmedabad: in a long-drawn operation on saturday night, the police nabbed the prime accused in the godhra train massacre, haji bilal ismail sujela, from an area known as haiyaat ni wadi. an indian passport was found on his person which showed he had visited pakistan twice officially, although there are allegations that he made frequent visits to karachi. preliminary investigations have indicated that bilal was in touch with the isi''s yusuf kharadi alias yusuf godhrawala. it was learnt that at the behest of kharadi he had also escorted ahmedabad-based underworld don abdul latif''s wife mehrunissa and his brother-in-law abdul raoof to pakistan from delhi by using a fake passport. bilal was arrested by a joint team of the anti-terrorist squad (ats), the godhra town police and the government railway police (grp) on saturday night in an operation involving over 30 men. police sources at godhra said bilal, who was the chairman of godhra municipality''s planning committee, had earlier been booked for about 10 offences, including pick-pocketing for which the railway police have the records. ""later, he also got involved in gambling and was running a club in godhra along with husain dhantiya, another accused in this case,"" said a police officer. bilal and the rest of the accused have been booked under poto and for murder. sources said that it was at this club that all the accused used to get together. the entire operation was supervised by dig (ats) vipul vijoy singh. others involved in the operation were dy sp (ats) abhay chudasama and godhra town police inspector kandarp trivedi. meanwhile, the gujarat government is learnt to have suspended a senior clerk in the irrigation department, inayat abdul sattar, for his alleged ''involvement'' in the godhra massacre, said sources. sattar, a senior clerk with the panam dam division, was taken into custody earlier along with 26 others. earlier, state police had sent teams to mumbai, madhya pradesh and chhota udepur to arrest bilal, whose main offence in this case, is of having stopped fire-fighters from reaching the scene of crime which could have saved many lives, said a senior police official. bilal will be handed over to cid (crime, railways), which is investigating the train carnage. in all, 51 persons were arrested in this case, said railway police sources. interestingly, the police has tracked down a similar attack on kar sevaks in bharuch district in 1992 when they were returning by dehradun express from ayodhya after the demolition of ''babri masjid'' and were attacked in a similar manner at palej, sources said. but there were no casualties then. sources said the case-file of the attack on the train carrying kar sevaks at palej in 1992 is to be submitted to the state government for reference and analysis from the angle of security, intelligence and investigation."	0	1	1	0	0
ahmedabad: last year, there was a different reason for not celebrating holi in gujarat. people generally remained indoor mourning the earthquake victims of the january 26 disaster. the festival on friday could be quite a damp affair this time, but it is the tension build-up in the air which is palpable. friday's holi has got the state on its nerves' edge. this year dhuleti is going to be a festival of different colours for gujarat -- there will be the army's green battle fatigues, bright blue of the raf and the khaki of the other uniformed personnel, punctuating the lanes and the by-lanes leaving little chance for people to play as freely as they used to. the tension led to a bout of panic buying of essential commodities across the state on thursday evening, with residents fearing a fresh bout of violence, a month after the riots first began. with thousands of inflammatory leaflets threatening bloodshed on friday in circulation and rumours flying thick and fast, the state home department has decided to extend the curfew to more areas of the state. the ahmedabad police have strictly banned pillion-riding in the city. additional commissioner of police (special branch) pramod kumar said that male pillion riders would not be allowed on the road on friday. the ban on playing with colours, balloons and bulbs would also be in force. indefinite curfew would also be imposed in as many as 16 police station areas of the city, some of them as a precautionary measure. along the same lines, curfew has been clamped on certain areas of visnagar in mehsana where a mixed population resides. in vadodara, the police are likely to impose curfew in six police station areas. but in surat, police officers said imposition of blanket curfew could lead to panic. in rural vadodara, an army column was dispatched to the tribal-dominated bodeli region where the festivities are traditionally quite robust. while no extra reinforcements have been called for, the army and the bsf will patrol ahmedabad continuously on friday. on thursday, the army conducted a flag march in sarkhej where trouble broke out following incidents of arson. meanwhile, governor sunder singh bhandari has appealed to the people to create an atmosphere of mutual trust in society by celebrating the festival of holi-dhuleti with peace and simplicity. related stories  Facebook Twitter Linkedin Mail	0	0	1	0	0

"mumbai: former prime minister v p singh on wednesday virtually challenged the centre on effective implementation of the controversial prevention of terrorism act and gave a call for a ""similar"" stringent legislation to take action against ""anyone who preached communal hatred."" ""majority se sarkar chal sakti hai, desh to sahmat se hi chalega (by brute majority you can run a government but the country will run only through concensus),"" said singh, who in 1990 first toyed with the idea of a national government headed by a ""concensus"" prime minister. participating in a meet-the-press programme at press club here, singh refused to support cpm''s appeal to opposition parties to ensure that the anti-terrorism law is not used in states run by them. ""what is the legal position...if a central law is enacted can state governments say no?"", he merely asked. opposing the legislation, he said gujarat ""under a rss pracharak"" was an ideal example of ""how pota could be misused ... it was used even against minors."" he also slammed gujarat chief minister narendra modi for circulating ""the theory of action and reaction"" to communally surcharged situation and asked ""what is there if there is reaction to that reaction.""

"This story is from March 25, 2002  himmatnagar: police in the urban areas of gujarat have drawn most of the flak so far owing to their being in constant media glare; but out in the countryside, where scores were killed, their failure to secure lives, besides their putting obstacles in the legal process of bring the guilty to book, seems to have gone largely unnoticed. the role of the police in sabarkantha district, as a case in point, has only recently become the subject of debate, from the lok sabha to the police bhavan in gandhinagar. the main allegation against the sabarkantha police is that they did not do enough to protect the innocent and were now preventing the registration of firs against the individuals who led the mobs. in fact, nearly 137 petitioners from the district had to move gujarat high court to have their voices heard. they claimed that the police had not recorded their individual firs. says congress mp from sabarkantha madhusudhan mistry, who raised the matter in the lok sabha, ""the role of the district police has been very dubious, the police are accepting firs which refer to a mob and not those where individuals leading the mob have been named."" the total loss to private business establishments in himmatnagar town is said to be as high as rs 50 crore, with most of the damage being done during curfew and often in the presence of the police. it is the role of district superintendent of police nitiraj solanki that has come into question as stray incidents of violence keep the situation on the boil even today. ""the last of the few remaining shops of the minorities within the town were torched during curfew in the last three days when no one was supposed to be out on the streets,"" says khadim lalpuria who runs the biggest relief camp for the minority community at mehtapura on the outskirts of the town. ""we have communicated our desire to give an award to solanki for his services against us,"" he adds in a sarcastic vein. ""people came in tractors from the neighbouring villages, heavily armed, and torched and looted shops in the commercial complexes along the national higway, cutting through the heart of the city... and all this took place amid the presence of the police personnel who did not do anything to control the mobs,"" alleged lalpuria. in fact, since march 20 when curfew was reimposed, several shops belonging to the minorities which were still untouched were also torched along with a dargah at mehtapura, barely 200 metres from the residence of the district collector. nitiraj solanki was not available for comment, but senior officials in the state police headquarters admitted that ""solanki has got all mixed up."" locals cannot but be apprehensive. they first saw the police look the other way when their establishments and houses were set on fire. now, the police is trying its best not to let the victims lift the veil of anonymity on the mobs. take the instance of baba harsulia of raj motors, who did manage to take down the registration number and identify three of the six people who were part of the 500-strong mob that torched his sprawling 11,000 sq-ft tractor showroom on the outskirts of the city. baba mentioned the details in a written complaint, but the road to justice seems strewn with roadblocks. ""first the police tried to convince us that it would be in our best interest if the police remained the complainant. when we insisted, the local police dissuaded us, saying technical problems could crop up if the complaint was duplicated in the fir filed by the police with one given by the victim himself. but all these are ways to block filing of the individual complaint where we have been able to identify a few who were part of the mob,"" says harsulia. shabbirbhai aglodia of jahirpura was similarly stone-walled when he went to the jadar police station to file a complaint about his house being burnt down. ""around 10 houses were burnt but the police refused to take down the complaint individually even though i had identified two persons in the mob."""	0	0	1	1	0
"This story is from March 31, 2002  mumbai: gujarat chief minister narendra modi maintained on saturday that the recent violence in his state would not shake the confidence of industrialists. he claimed that the business climate in gujarat had not been substantially affected by the communal riots. ""in fact, this morning, i received a couple of new investment proposals,"" he said at his first press conference in mumbai. he was here to inaugurate a branch of the rajkot cooperative bank. it was a aEUR~new-look modiaEUR(tm) who presented himself before the mumbai press corps. sounding injured, he said the media had wrongly projected him as being communal in his handling of the recent riots. denying all allegations levelled against him, he said he had never talked of giving comparatively less compensation to the muslim victims of the riots. he said muslim and hindu victims would be treated on par. he maintained that he had never stated that the violence in ahmedabad was a reaction to the burning of kar sevaks in godhra on february 27. mr modi condemned the godhra carnage and the subsequent bloody developments in the rest of gujarat. ""no civilised society would tolerate such heinous acts,"" he said. however, he firmly declined to give statistics regarding the number of persons killed and injured as well as the estimated damage to property. ""our information department is putting out these statistics,"" he said. mr modi said he would be speaking to leaders of all communities and would ensure that the climate of mutual trust was restored. rejecting the demands for the appointment of a judge from outside gujarat to probe the violence, mr modi said the retired judge entrusted with the task could be expected to do an impartial job. he said even the opposition parties in the gujarat assembly had not questioned his governmentaEUR(tm)s decision in this regard. on applying the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) in the state, he said no decision in this regard had been taken so far. he said he was advised by the state advocate-general that poto need not be applied before a primary investigation of the riot cases was completed. also, certain legal formalities needed to be completed before invoking poto. claiming that he had the full support of prime minister atal behari vajpayee and the party leadership for his decisions and actions so far, mr modi said the centre had extended cooperation for rehabilitating the riot victims in gujarat. ""the package will be unfolded during mr vajpayeeaEUR(tm)s visit to the state early next month,"" he stated. brushing aside a question about the demand for his resignation, mr modi said the prime minister and home minister l k advani had heard his analysis of the situation in gujarat for more than 45 mintues. moreover, mr vajpayee had said the centre would contribute to the rehabilitation and compensation package in the state.""you can draw your own conclusions from this,"" he added. mr modi said he was the first chief minister gujarat to form an all-party committee and to involve leaders of various communities, religions, political parties, industries and ngos for rehabilitation work, which would be conducted under the supervision the state governor. never in the past had this happened in the state, which had witnessed communal riots off and on, he pointed out. he patted himself on the back for bringing ""the situation under control within 72 hours"". he said communal riots had never been handled so ""swiftly"" gujarat in the past. he dismissed the daily incidents of violence as of little consequence. he noted that the past, places like godhra had been under curfew for as long as a year. ""this is not the case now,"" he said. he added that people belonging to both the majority and minority communities had died in the recent riots, ""of course in different proportions"", and that nearly 25 per cent of them had been killed by police bullets. the army had been deployed within 16 hours. never had the army been deployed in less than 45 hours in the past, he said."	1	0	1	0	1

""the procession of the sants would begin around 2.15 pm. i reckon they would take about 20-25 minutes to reach the designated spot to hand over the shila,"" he explained. the designated place for the shila daan at ramkot is about 3 kilometers away from the karsevakpuram, where mahant paramhans is staying. gupta, government sources clarified, would be receiving the shila as the government receiver of the acquired land, and not as the faizabad collector. when asked about the ground situation in ayodhya, gupta said with the paramhans accepting his proposal on handing over the shila, the crisis may have been defused for the time being. ""but, that does not mean that we will relax the security bandobast,"" he explained. an estimated 15,000 security personnel are based in ayodhya to counter any untoward incidents. when asked about his response to the opposition attacking the centre on the issue of a government official accepting the shila from the sants, gupta said he would not like to answer to this question. he also said he was not aware of any minority community organisation protesting against the government decision to appoint him as the receiver of the shila. even though the administration was now geared up to accept the sacred shila, there was still some confusion on what the government would do with it.

"This story is from March 16, 2002  gandhinagar: amid slogan shouting by opposition mlas calling for narendra modi''s resignation, the congress on thursday sharply critised the gujarat government for the intelligence failure in predicting either the godhra train massacre or the communal genocide that followed thereafter. while congress legislature party leader naresh raval asked why the forces that were supposed to be linked with the isi were at all allowed to flourish in godhra, congress chief whip siddharth patel wanted to know why were the kar sevaks returning from ayodhya on february 27 not provided with any police protection. patel asked ""i want to know from the state government what were the intelligence officials were doing on that fateful day? was there any prior information of what was to happen? if yes, then why preventive steps were not taken? the way the train was burnt and the manner in which the government allowed all this to happen leads one to suspect that the officialdom messed up things very badly somewhere."" the strong questions come at a time when congress has begun making allegations that the state intelligence officials were all busy at rajkot where chief minister narendra modi had just fought his assembly bypoll. patel, son of former chief minister chimanbhai patel, also wanted to know as to why the officialdom failed to predict what was in store even when the vhp gave a bandh call for february 28. referring to minister of state for revenue haren pandya''s speech earlier, patel said, ""it seems, the state government was fully aware of what would happen as a consequence to the bandh call. yet, it did not act in time. as a result, gujarat''s image has suffered a serious setback in the world."" pandya had said, speaking in the debate, ""the events such as cross-border terrorism, attacks on the hindus in kashmir, the isi activities in mosques and madrasas, the attack on parliament in delhi had adversely impacted upon the gujarati hindu psyche. it exploded after godhra."" during his statement, pandya revealed that as many as 85,155 people lived in 91 relief camps in gujarat run all over gujarat. minister of state for home gordhan zadaphia added that post-godhra, 668 persons had died in communal violence, out of which 100 were to police firing. the two ministers, during their intervention, did not say whether there was any prior information of godhra or the communal flare-up that followed. zadaphia confined his statement to when the army was called and how the riot was controlled within 72 hours. sharply criticising the bjp for playing the hindu card, raval said, ""the congress is not a party of one community. its voters include hindus, muslims, sikhs, others. we believe in brotherhood among all the people. the electoral politics that the bjp has begun to play makes one suspect that there is something fishy. the bjp must remember hindus have always been our voters. they will support us in future also."" he added, ""i am worried about the future of gujarat because after these riots investments will suffer."" the assembly, which began session at 8.30 am, was twice adjourned before the debate could begin as 50-odd congress mlas and independents shouted slogans demanding the cm''s resignation in the wake of the state government''s alleged failure. there was also furore from bjp benches when a congress mla alleged the cm had said he would hang himself if the riots were not controlled within 72 hours. the cm explained, he had actually said, ""if controlling riots within 72 hours was a crime, i should be hanged"".

This story is from March 18, 2002  ahmedabad: the gujarat high court observed on monday that it was open for the state government and the gujarat secondary education board to restore the option of alternative exams for the students of class-x and class-xii. while making it clear that the court did not want to interfere in the decision to give an optional exam, a division bench comprising justice rk abhichandani and justice kundan singh rejected a petition filed by prakash jhaveri of new gujarat jagrut vali mandal, seeking direction on this. the court observed that holding of exams at places where there are no disturbances and holding them at some other time at places where there are disturbances does not create any discrepancy. the state has the powers to conduct the exams and has the responsibility to complete it, so the court does not find it necessary to intervene, it said. additional advocate general kb trivedi appeared for the state, while government pleader ad oza appeared for the board. senior advocate yatin oza with advocate harin raval appeared for the petitioners. it was submitted by the government that the it has appointed a committee which is keeping an eye on the overall situation. the collector, who chairs the committee, has all the powers in this regard. besides, the government stated that when the exams have already started, the court''s intervention will adversely affect the students. the petitioner requested the court that the option given earlier to the students by the board has been withdrawn and it should be restored. the option was that the students may choose to appear for the exams on may 6, if not from march 18. the court, however, ordered that whether to offer such an option is open for the state government to decide. it was submitted by the petitioners that there is curfew in the cities of dabhoi, balasinore, bhavnagar and many others. the disturbances are going to increase day by day, it was submitted. thus, there will not be any consistency in the results of the examinations and thus, the actions of the respondents is bad and illegal and deserves to be quashed and set aside. it was submitted that the action of the respondents in holding the examinations from march 18 is contradictory to their own statements and policies. it had been decided by the government itself that the students would be permitted to appear for the examination, which is starting on may 6, in case they have not opted for the current examinations. the petitioners alleged that the decision was taken by the respondents to show that except for ahmedabad and vadodara city, there is peace in whole of gujarat and there are no disturbances. it was submitted that by this decision, the students who are appearing for the examinations in the cities except ahmedabad and vadodara, where there are disturbances and there is curfew, are going to be adversely affected, as they are not able to concentrate on their studies and some of the students would not be able to reach their centre of examination. the government changed its decision to give optional exams, despite the fact that there was no change in the circumstances. communal disturbances prevail all over gujarat and there is curfew in many cities. it would not be possible for the students to appear for the examination and therefore the action of the respondents deserves to be quashed and set aside, it was submitted. it sought directions to postpone the exams and hold them at some other time.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 15, 2002  lucknow:international vice-president of the vishwa hindu parishad giriraj kishore warned that demonstrations and dharnas will be held all over the country on saturday if the district administration arrested the sants in ayodhya on friday. this would be followed by a 10-day first phased programme beginning march 17 when ramsewaks would proceed to the temple town with the slogan ayodhya jayenge, mandir baneyenge and if need be, court arrest also. addressing a press conference, kishore, who would be leaving for ayodhya around 9 am on friday, slammed governor vishnukant shastri for making ayodhya a virtual jail by deploying 95 companies of military and para military forces and setting up 18 makeshift jails. he regretted what had not taken place during the british rule or during emergency was being done under the present dispensation. kishore stressed that any movement, if suppresesed by force, becomes more virulent and said the sants would proceed with their earlier announced programme of shila daan on friday. the vhp leader added a few mps from delhi would reach lucknow on friday for proceeding to ayodhya. referring to the pran daan announced by ramchandra paramhans, kishore said he had talked to the governor in this connection and warned that if any untoward incident took place, the consequences could be serious.he said shastri had told him that he was trying his best to defuse the situation, but paramhans was not prepared to listen to him. the vhp, on its part ,has appealed to paramhans not to take such a step as temple should be constructed under his tutelage. without commenting directly on the verdict of the supreme court, kishore said nothing would have happened if the apex court had given permission for performing puja. he added puja was already being performed in the 14 mandirs on the undisputed land as also the one on the disputed land. kishore,however, refused to comment when asked if the 'suppresive measures' adopted by the vajpayee government were similar to those enforced by mulayam singh yadav. he also pervicated when asked that the two main akharas in ayodhya were opposed to the strategy adopted for temple construction.	0	0	0	0	0
This story is from March 16, 2002  nadiad: nadiad, the headquarters of kheda district, has the privilege of having the first modern district jail in gujarat, built at a cost of rs 360 crore and situated nearly 5 km from here. it was inaugurated by then minister of jail ghabaji thakor on gujarat day, may 1, 1999. however, the key post of the district jail superintendent has been vacant since june, 2001. following eruption of communal violence here, the district jail has had to accommodate double its capacity - nearly 500 prisoners as against a capacity of 251. but considering this scenario, presently only four policemen and six jail guards are watching over 500 inmates, including 69 simi activists who were brought from surat. surprisingly, when nadiad sub-jail was not upgraded, it had a strength of 11 policemen, whereas despite it now being upgraded as district jail, it has a total strength of four policemen. due to acute shortage of personnel, the four watch towers are without policemen, threatening the security of the jail. recently when one of the prisoners had abdomen pain during night time, the acting district jail superintendent k d baria rushed the ailing prisoner to the local civil hospital without police escort due to inadequate police strength. though the district jail has a separate dispensary and workshop in the jail premises, it is yet to function as both are lying idle.	0	0	1	0	0
"new delhi: in a strong indictment of the gujarat government, the nhrc said on sunday that the inability of the administration to prevent the godhra carnage and the ensuing communal violence reflected ""inaction"" and ""inefficiency"" on its part and asked the officials of the state not to seek permission to perform their duty under the law but to act. nhrc chairman justice (retd) j s vermaaEUR(tm)s remarks at a news conference here assume significance in view of reports of gujarat police top brass meeting chief minister narendra modi and seeking a free hand to act.

"This story is from March 22, 2002  gandhinagar: the state industries minister suresh mehta claimed on wednesday that the impact of the recent communal riots on trade and industry was ""negligible and transitory."" replying to the debate on budgetary demands for his department in the gujarat assembly, he said the production loss to the industry after the riots broke out was rs 600 crore as against the rs 10,000 crore figure dished out by the congress. and, an official survey shows that 325 units had suffered damage of rs 55 crore. ""riots are not new to the state,"" mehta argued. ""they took place in 1969, 1985, 1992 and now in 2002. when the industry invests in the state, it fully takes into consideration the risks involved. despite the past riots, statistics show that gujarat has steadily progressed in industrial investment."" the reply was following the leader of opposition naresh raval''s argument that the direct damage to the units due to the riots was rs 3,000 crore. raval said, ""our image is down internationally. the british queen has taken note of it."" his deputy udesinh baria said general motors was contemplating shifting its plant from the state. mehta denied this and said he had ""checked"" with the gm officials and the news was wrong. gm officials had told the industries commissionerate on tuesday that they were going ahead with their fresh plan for investing rs 600 crore for manufacturing the new multi-purpose vehicle. mehta insisted that whatever slowdown one was witnessing in the state currently was because of the international recession. the growth rate in the us was down to 0.7 per cent now from one per cent a year before. india''s growth rate was down to 2.3 per cent in 2001-02 compared to 5.8 per cent in the previous year. and, because of the two droughts and the earthquake, gujarat''s growth rate was down to 2.23 per cent. yet, the state''s industrial growth remained at 5.05 per cent. mehta quoted the government of india figures to say that despite the recession, in 2001 till october, gujarat topped the list of foreign direct investment in india. of the rs 23,266 crore fdi approved, gujarat''s share was rs 6,185 crore, followed by rs 4,651 crore in maharashtra, rs 3,590 crore in tamil nadu, rs 1,138 crore in karnataka, rs 860 crore in delhi and rs 490 crore in andhra pradesh. raval, however, quoted the centre for monitoring indian economy figures to say that in cumulative terms, during august 1991 to november 2001, the state''s fdi share was 6.4 per cent of the country as a whole, compared to 17.46 per cent in maharashtra, 12.23 per cent in delhi, 8.33 per cent in tamil nadu and 7.78 per cent in karnataka. ""we stand no. 5 in foreign collaboration, without any doubt,"" he said. raval further referred to cmie figures to say that despite a huge rs 1,68,016 crore of intended investment in gujarat, in 2000-01, the rate of implementation was 47.47 per cent, down from 66.31 per cent in 1994-95 and 56.21 per cent in 1997-98. ""this rate is lower than not only the competing states but also the backward states in the far-east,"" he said. ""even the concessional package in the wake of the quake has failed to attract investments in gujarat."" congress mla subhash shelat, former industries minister, quoted the socio-economic review: gujarat state 2001-02, to say that the state''s net value added in the factory sector has been going up only marginally since 1997-98. ""it went up drastically from rs 2,152 crore in 1985-86 to rs 17,621 crore in 1990-91, further to rs 19,293 crore in 1996-97. then it stagnated, increasing only marginally later - in 1999-2000 it was rs 19,366 crore."""	0	0	0	0	0

""let the central congress leadership question the vhp first, then we will take the cue,"" replied senior congress mla to tnn. meanwhile, the bjp mlas were all praise for urvashi devi''s sharp attacks on the madrassas, with zadaphia assuring the house that their activities would come under the scanner and the loudspeakers used without permission will be banned."	0	0	0	0	0

ahmedabad: pressure from the nda allies at the centre has finally forced the gujarat government to withdraw the application of the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) against the suspects in the godhra train carnage on february 27. gujarat government has decided to withdraw the application of poto and instead apply provisions under the indian penal code in these cases, chief minister narendra modi said on friday. modi said the state government had sought the advice of the advocate-general, before taking the decision in this matter. police had arrested 62 persons in connection with the february 27 sabarmati express carnage in which 58 passengers were charred to death. almost all these persons had been booked under poto while those arrested for the post-godhra riots, which have claimed over 700 lives, were booked under ipc sections. sources said that gujarat government was advised by the centre to withdraw the application of poto because of a hue and cry raised by the nda allies, especially the samata party, janata dal (united), telugu desam and trinamul congress, on the ground that the government was discriminating between the accused in the godhra carnage and those involved in the subsequent riots. this is the second time that the bjp government in gujarat has had to go back on its discriminatory approach towards the godhra incident and the subsequent riots. earlier, it has announced a compensation of rs 2 lakh for the godhra victims and rs 1 lakh for those killed in the post godhra riots. however, that decision was subsequently withdrawn.

ahmedabad: aEUR~aEUR~the perpetrators of the gujarat bloodbath will be brought to the book,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) resonates the political machinery at the centre, time and again. though a deluge of firs referring to mob violence accounts for the bloodied chapters of gujarat, in the end, the guardians of law may simply let loose the offenders with minor punishments. for, death sentence or life-term imprisonment may or may not be meted out to an offender, if a given case is converted from aEUR~aEUR~murderaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) to aEUR~aEUR~murder in dacoityaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm), apprehend legal experts. they even have expressed serious doubts about the real killers of the recent riots ever being prosecuted, leave alone, being held guilty of the heinous crimes. sources said cases on the gruesome killing of 128 persons in the naroda-patia and chamanpura areas of ahmedabad during the riots could be given a turn with heavy pressure to replace from the firs section 302 (murder) of the ipc with sections 396, 397 and 398 of the ipc, which relate to aEUR~aEUR~murder in dacoityaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). legal experts believe this possible move may just give a leeway to the offenders and could tone down their offence. the meghaninagar police, investigating the chamanpura incident in which former congress mp ehsan jaffri was also killed, have arrested 18 persons in the case. there are doubts too if the heavyweights named in the firs will ever be arrested. about the chamanpura case, the police say: aEUR~aEUR~to start with, we had lodged the fir under section 302. but on questioning the witnesses, it was found that there were incidents of dacoity too.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) but legal experts say while conviction in murder would automatically lead to a death sentence or life imprisonment, a conviction under sections of aEUR~aEUR~murder in dacoityaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) concludes with death or imprisonment for life and fine or rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and a fine. in other words, the guilty can get away with a 10-year term that is not possible under section 302. criminal lawyer b m gupta says: aEUR~aEUR~these are cases of brutal murder and cannot be scaled down to dacoity.aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) and, interestingly, police officers admit that they have been under pressure against arresting offenders or booking them under serious offences. joint commissioner of police m k tandon, however, said such talk of aEUR~aEUR~replacing the sections is nonsenseaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm). the riot victims may feel they are on the path to getting justice by having filed the fir. but as advocates helping some of the victims are realising, the police may have skilfully manipulated many of the firs to ensure that the accused go scot-free. all they have to do is accuse a faceless mob of the violence, effectively ensuring that the fir ends up as just another piece of paper. with no specific person accused, the police will not be able to make any arrests even if they want to. citizenaEUR(tm)s initiative, a consortium of 28 leading ngos in the city, has collected a large number of, what are known as, aEUR~omnibus firsaEUR(tm) where the name of the accused is given as aEUR~aEUR~a mob of 10,000aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) or aEUR~aEUR~an unruly mobaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm).
