The Hindu reports that the Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI Maoist) cadres killed a tribal, identified as Wadeka Nasanna, of Dandabadi village under Narayanpatna Block in Koraput District late in the night of February 16.

The Maoists left a handwritten letter at the spot claiming the victim was killed as he was opposed to the activities of the Maoists and the Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh (CMAS) in the area.
