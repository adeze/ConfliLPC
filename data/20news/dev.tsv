" assuming yours is a non turbo MR2, the gruffness is characteristic of a large inline 4 that doesn't have balance shafts.  i guess toyota didn't care about ""little"" details like that when they can brag about the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling.  myself, i automatically cross out any car from consideration (or recommendation) which has an inline 4 larger than 2 liters and no balance shafts..  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you ever want a halfway decent engine.    if the noise really bugs you, there is nothing else that you can do except to sell it and get a V6.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my Honda Accord break question. It does seem that the master cylinder is bad. I will have my mechanic double check and be sure it isn't something simpler and cheaper first, but from your responses it sounds like it is very likely to be the master cylinder.  Thanks everyone!!	0
   This is a good idea - so you can carry your (non-alcoholic) drinks without spilling or having someone hold on to them.   Fax machines, yes.  Cellular phones:  Why not get a hands-free model?   Seemingly unique to American luxury cars.  The Big Three haven't yet realized that the 1970s are over.   I agree.  Just another display of Yuppie excess.	0

Joni Ciarletta writes  You are not alone.  My '79 Honda Accord with 110,000 miles on it started   showing the same behavior.  I replaced the brake master cylinder myself.  It took about an hour and cost   about $45.  Sure beats paying $300 to have someone else do it!  If I wanted to   rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one, it would   have cost only $20 to $30 for the rebuild kit.  The Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the   engine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky   part was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench   rounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.    Wow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt   the new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.	0
addition,  Bricklins were manufactured in the 70s with engines from Ford. They are rather   odd looking with the encased front bumper. There aren't a lot of them around,   but Hemmings (Motor News) ususally has ten or so listed. Basically, they are a   performance Ford with new styling slapped on top.   Rush fan? 	0

"You can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop doesn't see it right away...Valentine is the best detector by far (as stated by Car and Driver) and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from.  It also gives the amount of ""threats"" it is picking up, so if you go through  the same place everyday, and it always goes off there, you can glance at the  number of ""threats"" the Valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop.

       ^^^^       Rears also vented   Then you shouldn't've done it. Try answering the damn question. I am well aware of the fact that there was no mention of the SC in there.   Well, my point was that the SC and the SHO both have very similar characteristics (front and rear disks (ABS on the SHO?), high output V6, 4-wheel independent suspension, very good aerodynamics, 3-point harness, fat rubber, and 130mph+ top speed). If one of them is  up to standard (and I think the SC is), but the other isn't, then why is that? No flamage, just curiousity.       James	0
"I have a '71 Buick Skylark with 148K on it.  I bought it in California, and if it'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work.  The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is stuck in the ""vent"" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air flow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't  live without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the  defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well, kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.  I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down and outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in- side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.  Two questions:   1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than  the fact that I should move from Indiana) ?   2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there  a way to ""fix"" this?

" Because Greyhound has apparently gotten around to installing their RADAR collision-prevention system. They use RADAR to monitor how close other vehicles are and how fast their relative speeds are, and signals a warning to the driver if they're coming up on something too fast or are getting too close.  This is all I remember from the news reports a few months back; at the time, they were only talking about the possibility of installing the system. (They didn't mention how it worked in bumper-to-bumper traffic, or how it discriminated between a Camaro approaching at 120mph and ye olde bridge support in the median being approached  at 60mph on a curve.)  I do recall something about progressive stages of warnings, from flashing lights to audible warnings--ie, it goes from a red ""Too close"" light to hysterically screaming ""WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!!""  :-)      James"	0

"Now, my ego with regards to my shifting ability is as big as anyone else's, but I just ordered my first car with an auto trans. I wasn't planning on it; but after driving a few I was convinced: Things have changed since the days of  ""Slip 'n' Slide Withe Powerglide"". They shift *better* than I do, there's no clutch to wear out (Honda wanted $800 for my 4WD wagon last year!- got it done for $500), it only costs about 5% in gas milage on the highway and it makes it easier to concentrate on all the radios in my car ;-)  (Oddly enough, while two of my best friends- both in the auto industry here in the  Motor City- have switched wholeheartedly to autos, their wives *insist* on  manual. Shift envy?)  Braggadocio aside, given today's technology and the warranties they're handing  out the auto trans seemed like an excellent choice. Call me a convert."	0
 Two shots at it: (1) Check the tires again - if you can see the wear bars, you're down to problem area (and some tires pass a penny test between the bars - that's no guide at all). Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning. You may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the tire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.  (2) Tires age. In particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you put them thru more heat cycles. Harder compounds don't grip as well as soft ones. Effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot very often, such as in competition, but it hits all tires.	0

I just visited the NY Auto Show, and saw two LH cars on the floor: Eagle  Vision and Dodge Intrepid.   Really nice I must say. Very attractive styling, lots of features and room,  at a competitive price.    Unfortunately, the workmanship is quite disappointing. On BOTH cars, the rubber seals around the window and door fell off. It turns out the seals are just big grooved rubber band. It goes on just by pressing the groove against the tongue on the door frame. Surely it would come off easily.  I am not sure how many of this kind of pooring engineering/assembly problems that will show up later.  I may still consider buying it, but only when it establishes a good track record.	0

 The part about spending $5000-7000 on repairs reminds me of an article I read in a magazine comparing the 5 year ownership costs of a Toyota Camry and a Ford Taurus or something like that.  The result, which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period.  That was their argument to prove that you don't go wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry.   Now, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so more in initial costs.  Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extra on repairs on the Taurus.  That is ridiculous.  Every time your car needs repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things. I would much rather spend $5000 more in initial costs than spend $4000 more in repair costs. 	0

" I would be concerned about how the car was driven and how well it was maintained.  I own a turbocharged one, and I would never buy a turbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and his/her driving/maintenance habits.   I have been wondering about that myself.  The '90 AWD models and the '91s were identical (except for the ABS option).     Yes.  Some owners had problems with the transaxles.  Using synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most cases.  The problem was not unique to the AWDs, however.  It was common to all models.  The Galant VR4 and GSX had the same transaxle, but I didn't see those listed in CR.   I don't know of any major complaints in this area, except that the battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating.    The first FWD models (those built before May 1989) were recalled for brake upgrades.  Some FWD and AWD owners had problems with warped rotors.  Those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem.   I can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one day!  It all depends on how you drive.  It seems that most owners have been getting between 40-70k on a set of pads.   First time I hear about a problem with the valve train on these cars, other than timing belt failures.   If your friend ""beats"" on the car, then his unit is not a representative sample of the car's reliability.  My suggestion is instead of listening to the useless Consumer Reports, talk to several owners (the mailing list may be the best way to reach a few of them).   #if (humor_impaired) skip_to TheEnd No matter how much you pay, you won't get all three.

I'm wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter? I've been doing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I've got over 150k. I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?  On some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless. To date I've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. Some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker & easier they where to shift.  My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window, I lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). I also skip gears some times using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5. 	0

First from the finance guy and then from the general manager, both hounding me for the extra money.  They left me alone once I told them I already had the paperwork and pointed out the clause in the contract that stated that the final price was just that: FINAL. Afterall, they wouldn't budge if I had told them I wanted another $300 off after the deal had been signed, right?  I told them not  to call again and that I would not do business with them in the future. They didn't seem to have a problem with that.  This, after all, was a used Ford at a Toyota dealership.  I had a much better experience buying a new Pathfinder about a month ago.  It certainly pays to buy a car on the last Sunday of the month.

"    I won't argue too much about anything.  I am probably one of those that  think that we can't have enough safety on the roads.

The ratio of the probability of fallen trees/rocks on the roads to  oncoming traffic is too low to even be considered.

" Well Sweden and Australia, and lord knows wherever else used to drive on the ""wrong"" side of the road, so the export market might have been larger then than just the UK.   By the 1920s, there was a very active ""good roads"" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco ""America on the Road"" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called ""The Devil Wagon in God's Country"" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or John Bell Rae's auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why.   Dan dh3q@andrew.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon University Applied History"	0
 only when the torque converter is not locked up.  there are autos out there with converter lock up in 2nd, 3rd and 4th gears.   rare.. so are 5 speed autos.. but very real.   i think that automatics have advanced far more than manuals. especially in shift intelligence.  i say that a smart automatic is better than the majority of drivers in terms of being in the right gear at the right time, which to me is more important than torque converter losses.   who says you can't have your cake and eat it too?  a well designed shifter will easily facilitate manual, clutchless shifts.  i am referring to the much copied mercedes jagged gate.  the only department where you lose out is in the number of ratios available, and of course the converter losses..  if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission, it can't be half bad..  :-) 	0
"Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6  [New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]   Many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite automotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it.  This article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard Unix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can list it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)  First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin, or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is probably not good enough.  Listserv:  There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which is available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably  look at listserv carefully.  The Alias file:  On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:  foo:   bar, baz, bletch   which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest possible email list is   my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address my-favorite-car-request: my-address  this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:  my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list my-favorite-car-request: my-address  Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory, owned by the list admin.  Bounced Mail:  this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating. Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup, by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)   school-request:   welty school-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list school: ""|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school"" owner-school: school-request owner-school-out: school-request   here's what is going on here:  the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties.  school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses, it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name; the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the actual list members.  the shell script i use is as follows:  ----------------- #!/bin/sh cd /tmp sed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \         (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \          echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \          echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \          cat -) | \         /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \                 -F ""The ${1} Mailing List"" ${1}-rebroadcast exit 0 -------------------  note that this script does not know the name of the list; the name is passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple lists (i run several out of this site.) the script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming message, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to: 99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.  For digested lists, there is some digestification software around. Hopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future version of this posting.  richard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)"	0

" Comparing the GTZ and GSR is apples to oranges, somewhat like a Mustang 5.0 and a CRX, both have very different ways of doing things and ought to appeal to different buyers, i.e., I don't think an Acura owner would be seen dead in a Chevy dealership or vice versa.  [stuff deleted]   No Integra I have seen comes with all-season tires.  The GTZ does come with much bigger 16"" wheels.   The C+D figures are almost certainly bogus and based on a hot prototype supplied by Acura. The MT figures are more plausible.  16.1 sounds reasonable, probably faster than regular Integras.   The GSR gearing is horrible for day to day driving. It needs a 6 speed box more than any other modern car. Essentially 5th in a regualr Integra equals 4th in the GSR, and the regular Integras are very buzzy at speed.   The only person I knew with a GTZ had it bought back by GM as a lemon. It was a piecve of junk, but very quick for FWD.   The only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than 5k miles, a rare screw up by Honda. Both the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars. The performance enthusiasts would take the GTZ and the CR purchase would be the GSR. "	0
 That is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live.  If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:  1) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2) a flashing red LED  These two are basic to a decent alarm system.   To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock. That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target. But, then there's always car-jacking.   Why is life so confusing? I hope I helped somewhat.	0
 Ah, we are looking for good people just like you. We are a very concerned group of citizens who are absolutely disgusted at the way that the majority of drivers simply disobey traffic rules like going above the speed limit, passing on our right, and riding our tails, while all the while we respectfully abide by the rules of this great country and maintain the mandated speed limits with our calibrated, certified cruise controls, while keeping the respectful 1.5 car length distance/10 mph speed. How many times have you been ticked off by some moron who jumps ahead in the (5.5 * 1.5)8.25 car lengths  that you have left between you and the vehicle ahead of you while driving 55 mph? Finally you have an option. We are a totally member supported group that perform functions for our own good, for the good of this great country  but MOST of all for those unfortunate ones that are too stupid to realize it, bless their souls. For a paltry $10, you can join Citizens for Rationally  Advanced Piloting(C.R.A.P), a non-profit, members only, society. But, but,but, there is a slight hitch, the initiation rite. To be a full fledged member of this exclusive club, you must proof that you are able to be in the fast lane of the busiest interstate in your area, keep the correct 1.5 car lenth/10 mph speedand I know this can be difficult with those morons around, NOT let anybody pass you, not in the next lane, not in the slow lane, not in the breakdown lane, not NOWHERE. For a complete list of acceptable interstates and times, send $5. And by the way, over 90% of our members are highly regarded attorneys in the auto field and they are completely, absolutely positively in the business ONLY to serve your best interests. As a testament to their virtues, they will give members 90% off the initial consultation fee. Feel free to drop me a line at your earliest convenience and remember, only SPEED kills!	0

"rites: something near the suburbs, people do at least glance over.  Remember, an alarm is only a deterent, not a prevention.

 This kind of behavior is what I was shocked by in my 'experience'. For   crying out loud, how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers   this way and still stay in business? Again, I don't expect sales people to   bow, scrape, and grovel in my presence but I sure don't expect to be   abused either. I was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to   me and in other 'negotiating' sessions I overheard in neighboring sales   cubicles. Evidently, their success rate is high enough that they continue   to do business this way. There must be a lot of people out there who are   easy to intimidate.  On the other hand, I'm not sure about the 'one price, no haggling'   approach that Saturn and other are starting to use. I guess if their fixed   price is fair it's OK. Maybe the best approach is to do your homework   before you go in. Find out the invoice prices of the car, add a reasonable   profit for the dealer ($200-$300??), offer them that price and stick to   it. If they get abusive, just leave. Then, don't let them try to screw you   after the deal is agreed on.	0
 Perhaps instead of this silly argument about what backup lights are for, couldn't we agree that they serve the dual purpose of letting people behind your car know that you have it in reverse and that they can also light up the area behind your car while you're backing up so you can see?  Backup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used to be on older cars. Those on my Taurus Wagon are quite bright enough to illuminate a good area behind the car, and they're  MUCH brighter than those on my earlier cars from the 60s and 70s.   Insofar as Vettes having side backup lights, look at a '92 or '93 model (or perhaps a year or two earlier too) and you'll see red side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the car's hindquarters.  Those aren't just white reflectors. 	0

   What I don't understand is why     Yep.  They are popular vehicles.  You don't see a lot of previous model year ones sitting on dealer's lots for any lenghth of time after the new ones are out.  The things sell, they are popular.  Because they are popular, and high-priced new, they are high price used, very simple.  I knew they were overpriced when I bought it... I knew they had a terrible  reliability record when I bought it.  But I didn't expect anything like I got, especially with a dealer network unable to repair it.  Personal experience has quickly cured me of my infatuation with the machine.	0

 While your 0-60 time is consistent with most car magazines and reports, I saw the PBS MotorWeek show clock a 5-speed SL2 at 7.9 seconds.  I'm sure that most SL2 owners will be VERY lucky to get this speed, but 7.9 seconds is still astonishingly fast for a small 4-door.  A new Civic EX runs about 8.2 seconds 0-60, if I'm not mistaken.  Most cars in this class are lucky to be in the 9-second range. 	0
Well the European Manta and US GT have entirely different bodies. There is little or no chance that they are the same. The Manta went through several generations as the coupe version of the Ascona and was OK in its time.   Not true. The Kadett has been in and out of the US market over the years. The LeMans (old Kadett) is only the latest version.   Craig  Different Cars. One looks like a sports-car, the other is a coupe.	0

Rob Reilly:   This is just not so - many of the earliest cars had their steering controls in the center of the vehicle, and there is no discernible pattern of left- or right-hand steering controls until a few years into the 20th century, when, in America at least, left-hand wheels became the pattern.

What about the hundreds of volunteers ( teenagers and others) who worked to clean up the mess after the Rodney King riots in LA?  Have you gone to your local high school play recently? Attended the school orchestra performances? Have you seen how many kids volunteer to pick up trash, plant trees, do walk-a-thons? How many kids have tried to sell you stuff to benefit organizations they belong to? How many girl scout cookies have you bought? How many chocolate bars for good causes?

What about the wonderful teenagers all over the place who work hard at school, get good grades, go to college (or to work) and make a real contribution to our society?  All humans are teenagers at some time in their lives! Mother Theresa was a teenager and so was Geoffrey Dahmer.

Hi,  My friend's 1983 Toyota Tercel accelerates by itself without using the gas peddel. The repairman said it has a internal leak of air in the carburetor and needs a new carburetor (costs $650). She likes to know if it is possible to fix the problem without replacing the whole carburetor.	0

 Oh PULLEEZE!  It's not biology at all, it's clothing design.  Women's clothing is generally designed to be as non-functional as possible.  It's only been in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with pockets deep enough to carry anything in.  Previously, deep pockets were virtually unknown in women's clothing.  Skirts generally have better pockets now, too.  Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty hopeless.  I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're dressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by a purse.  If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I think manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.  There's an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi's Backlash that described what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the need for functional women's clothing.  The manufactuing industry lost millions.  From a woman who would rather buy men's clothing WITH decent pockets and long legs and high waists than women's clothing without....      	0

I had exactly the same problem with a 1981 Horizon.  Third gear would just disengage.  Engine would rev up.  Kind of disconcerting.  I sold that car quite a few years back but the memory of that tranny sticks with me.  It also had a clutch chatter in first that the dealer could not fix.  If the lemon law had been in place then, that car would have been covered.  I have had several Jap cars since then (figuring the Horizon was my contribution to the American Auto Companies), and have never seen any bad behavior with the exception of a Toyota Tercel with a bit of clutch chatter that they did fix on the first try.  Anyway, from that day forward, I have sworn that I would never purchase another American car with a standard.  American manufacturers don't have a clue on how to manufacture five speed transmissions and have been doing the automatics much longer and on many more cars. However, I hate automatics, so I am still buying Jap cars.  Not sure this is any help, but other cars do this too.

   I would suggest you take the car to the nearest Chevron dealer, with your own oil and filter.  Ask for an oil change.  It will cost less than $10.  Watch him/her do it.  Just from watching someone do a job, you will be able to learn and remember the sequence, and do it right when you do it yourself the next time.  Besides, when he/she loosens the drain nut, the next time around it will be easier for you.    If it is stuck, use an impact wrench.  Not too much force though. Use a new washer each time you put the nut back.....	0

seningen@maserati.ross.com (Mike Seningen)    The funny thing about the digital dash (87 T-bird) with the 85mph speedo  limit was that if you pressed the button to convert to kilometers it would  read all the way up to 187kph.  At this point the stock anemic 302 would get  short of breath.  This of course was equivalent to about 116mph (hehe).I bet  I really coulda confused this thing if I'd toyed with the engine and rolled the stupid thing (the digits were limited to 199).

  Say, you bought your Saturn at $13k, with a dealer profit of $2k. If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for the same car.  So isn't that saving money?  Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000,  then their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:  1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.   2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.  Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even  the buyers for other cars will pay less.  Isn't that saving money?  	0

the   Not Quite the point to be considdered here! Fact: If/When Apple release system 7 (or what ever is current at the time  of release) then you will see shortly afterwards Apple no longer producing  Hardware...Look at Next with their NextStep486 to see what happens. Who is going to pay Apples Prices when they can get the same thing cheaper  else where! (Heck we can get a Sun Workstation cheaper than a Quadra, and  infact we have a number of times!!!, it ALL comes down to $$$$)  them, It   No the continued develeopment is because there is becomming less and less  profit in Hardware, So the Next Step (no pun intended...well sort of), is  to make the money in software (look at Microsoft if you think it can't  happen!), after all you can sell multiple pieces of software to ONE  hardware platform.  As you also said Windows is a nightmare for programmers, so will the  temptation to sell system 7 to a couple of MILLION dos users be too much  for Apple!

      I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images, loaded with the proper software. However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on its screen or any attached video because that ability is not in the ROM.

A week or so ago, I posted about a problem with my SE/30:  I have 20 megs or true RAM, yet if I set my extensions to use a large amount of memory (total of all extensions) then my system will crash before the finder comes up.  What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load, or sounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple's memory control panel.  Apple's cache is at 64K, mode 32 is on, and so is 32 bit addressing.  All extensions work by themselves or with the others until I increase the memory used by some of them (with methods mentioned above).  Well, here's my latest followup...  I ran NOWs System Profile and got this information:  %%% Memory info %%%  Physical RAM size: 20480K. Logical RAM size: 20480K. Size of Low Memory Area: 8K. Virtual Memory: Inactive. Addressing mode: 32bit mode in use. 32 bit System zone: Absent. Parity RAM: Not capable. Growable System Heap: True. Temporary memory support: Present. Tempory Memory Support: Real and tracked.  Note that 32 bit System zone is absent.  Could this be the problem? How can I turn this on?  Any ideas?  Can anyone help?	0

If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.  Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the end.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2 boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the ""experts"".  My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they must have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MO drive and Sharp scanner has one for each.

   I think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general.  The processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the computer is used in its designed purpose.  Comparing processor speed is pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other things.   I mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without  giving is operational conditions?  Can you say the same when  you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions. Knowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to  its FPU and 486 does, can you say that 040 is still faster?   Anyway, I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers is good or not solely on its processor.  Or how fast a processor is based on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to a processor to speed it up.     But if we restrict our arguements to, for example, pure processor architectural issues.  Or how one processor will work well and another will not based on its design, then we can get somewhere with our discussions.    - Chung Yang	0

There isn't a doubling in performance, but it _is_ quite significant. Maybe about a 70% increase in performance.  Besides, for 0 wait state performance, you'd need a cache anyway.

  How many NuBus slots do you have?  Applied Engineering has something called the QuadraLink, which is a card with 4 serial ports that you get at through the comms toolbox (in addition to the built-in ones) It also comes with software for fooling applications to open an AE port when they think they open a built-in port.  They also have a more expensive card with DMA (better performance) and I _think_ they, or someone else, have a card that handles 8 ports simultaneously.  As I said, with NuBus, you're green.

At least, Marvin's friend has not been able to : locate one and neither have I.  What is the fundamental reason for : this?  I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.  (Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive...)  NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there is no problem building an expansion box.  The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that: here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2 video cards in, and just watch them conflict! Of course, the extra  electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so guess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines?  So, yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice.	0

"If you get the Centris 650 with CD configuration, you are getting a Mac with a 68RC040 processor that has built-in math coprocessor support.  My  understanding is that the ""optional fpu"" refers to your option of purchasing the Centris 650 4/80 without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU.  Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU system.  And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system (a 68LC040) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor. Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610, which ONLY comes with a non-FPU 68LC040 processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU - the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another (again, according to Apple's memo).

Regarding the post for information about the Mac Portable and the  Powerbook 100, here are a couple of the answers: (1) Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk? Yes (2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000  running at 15.87 Mhz. (3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a  lot of memory. (4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors  that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors  sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell  memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most  memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether  the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine  California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB -  $140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that  are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here. (5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an  average access time of about 25 ms. (6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a  backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move  your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or  non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.  Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay  for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to  sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about  $650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for  about $900.   The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.  I'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable? Anybody got  one they want to sell? -- Good Luck, Gene Wright 	0
I've got the official word on the LaserWriter Pro 600 memory upgrade.  I just got off of the phone with the quite friendly Donna Rossi at Apple Customer Assistance.

stuff deleted stuff deleted  The problem mentioned last is a known Quadra SCSI problem, it was heavily discussed last year and an Apple employee pointed out that there was a one byte error in the SCSI driver routine for the Quadra's (at least the 700 and 900).  System 7.1 should not have that problem, for most people the  solution was to get an updated driver from the drive manufactor.  In my case MASS Microsystems wrote a new driver which fixed the problem on my Quadra 700, all that occured early last year.	0

 Nec Toshiba and Sony (Apple) nearly deliver the same speed. As apples prices are very low (compared to there RAM SIMMS) You should buy what is inexpencive. But think of Driver revisions. It is easier to get driver kits from Apple than from every other manufacturer  Christian Bauer	0
 I have the a CD-Technology drive with the Toshiba mechanism, and it is supposedly the fast and best now.  It has an access of 200ms and a data transfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is available from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two mail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since I've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped to my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The CD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive, which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to attract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the CD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly lower price with two free CDs.  The Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I think, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the three mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple catalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo cd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of which are pretty good.  The NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around $600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible before, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of the older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's unless you buy it in a bundle.  Of the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the Apple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's compatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's speed and performance.   BTW, the models of the drives are:  Apple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)  CD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but it is also something like with 3401)  NEC:  CDR-74   I'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems whatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am pretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not.  Also, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as the president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california, my hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is just a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the enormous chinese community.  Besides, one of my doctors in california has three Steve Liu's as patients and another Steve Liu comes to my school and lives in the next dorm.  This is to show that Liu is very common.  Steve :-)	0

I haven't seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a mac. We would like to try it, and I wonder if someone had some good advice.  We have a Mac IIcx with the original internal Quantum 40MB hard disk, and an unusable floppy drive. We also have a new spare Connor 40MB disk which we would like to use. The idea is to replace the broken floppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be some problems:  The internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only connectors for one single hard disk drive.  If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each (1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?  Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?  What about terminators? I suppose that i should remove the resistor packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave them installed in the other disk.  The SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets ID #1. The old one should have ID #0.  It is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive, as we have an external floppy that we can use if it won't boot of the hard disk.  Thank you! 	0
  The original Mac II had an Apple MMU chip installed which performs a subset of the 68851's functions.  If you look underneath your front left floppy bay you will find three chips, all approximately the same size.  One will be the 68020, the next the 68881, and the third, approximately the same size, will be the Apple chip.  It is easy to spot because it has a 'hump' in the middle of it.   Example:                            -----------                         /           \          ---------------             ---------------          |                                         |          |                                         |  That and the Apple logo should make it easy to find.	0
1)    I have an old Jasmine drive which I cannot use with my new system.

 If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to read the second session.  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.  Here is a simplified way of looking at it: The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not taking multiple directories into account.	0

I've been looking into getting a portable Mac to do some work and I've had my eye on the PB 100. Lately, I've been seeing people with the old portables, and they're selling for $300 LESS that the PB 100s. What I want to know is: what are the differences between them? All I know is that the Portable is heavier, but the PB100 doesn't have an internal drive. Here's what I NEED to know:  Does the portable support Appletalk/network connections? What's the CPU inside a Portable? (68000?) DOES THE PORTABLE SUPPORT SYSTEM 7????????? What's the maximum memory capacity of the Portable? Can you still get  RAM (meaning: does it use special SIMMS?) What kind of internal HD does it use? Does the Portable have a better screen?        THANX in advance.	0

"Hello fellow humans, and other net creatures...   If you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me: djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu   I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I have two monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces, I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one screen.   I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you don't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes for the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time service in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and flip it in your direction.

It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen, and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it.   Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - not including shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). Again, make an offer if that sounds unreasonable.

Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg SIMMS).   Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking **$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box and packaging. I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card together, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a ""bundled offer"" for these items.   ------------   Cheers.   dan keldsen - djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu "	0
 The Quadralink by AE is a possibly problematical solution to your needs. I've used one for the last 4 (?) years on my personal system, but a fatal bug has crept into their more recent s/w. The bug only shows up during heavy serial traffic but completely crashes the system (MacsBug can not reboot, time to hit the restart button).  AE told me in January that they were aware of and working on fixing the bug which I described to them. Since then they have not answered any of my faxes asking them for a status of the bug-fix.  The QL has been great, but for now I have mine sidelined. If you are only going to be using 2400 Baud or less, then you may have no, or very infrequent problems, 	0

     I've had my Duo 230 for a few weeks now and suffer from both of the above problems. I reinstalled my system software twice in an effort to combat the problems - thinking they were system software problems. Initially reinstalling the system seemed to help but not anymore. Occasionally when I try to wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on the screen - it freezes.  I also get the high-pitched hiss occasionally - but only at startup.  I've called the apple hotline (800 SOS-APPL) three times already and finally they agreed something is astray after my Duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by itselft and put itself to sleep. This problem only occured twice. Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in New York but the problem now is intermittent and I can't afford to be without my Duo at this time.

 >With that in mind...  I just recently purchased the GCC BLP Elite and I really like it.  My needs are much the same as what you describe.  In addition, I wanted to get one that I could access via AppleTalk, so that eliminated the new line of inexpensive  printers from Apple.  The print quality is good to excellent based on what  font you're using and what paper you use.  I'm still experimenting with  different papers, but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work fine.  Printing envelopes, transpariencies, letter head, or other single feed jobs is very easy.  There is an adjustable, automatic centering, guide on top of the sheet feeder which aligns the paper properly (and doesn't feed a sheet from the sheet feeder, as some do).

I have read one report of a brave soul who rewired the 40 mhz clock and a higher speed clock oscillator's outputs through a double throw switch to allow different  speeds. There was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but if the SI uses timing loops anything like a Quadra for accessing its floppy drive, dynamic switching will wreak havoc. A Quadra must reboot after having its clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its floppy drive.  	0

No.  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed. Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and I/O speed.  As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  If you have a 50MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory every 20ns.  Sure, you can put all 20ns memory in your computer, but it will cost 10 times as much as the slower 80ns SIMMs.  And roughly, the 68040 is twice as fast at a given clock speed as is the 68030. 	0

I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc. It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much).   well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell me the order of the wires.   there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.   if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.   btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of little boxes).

I like it a lot. It is worth the additional expense. The only problem I found is with MS Word (5.1a). If you have a table the is longer than a page and the cells have a visible border, the last (bottom of page) line on the first page will be missing. It makes no difference how the table is formatted. The worst is that it doesn't show up in word's page view or page preview.  --   Arie.	0

The Toshiba has a 200ms access time, the NEC has a 280ms access time, right around the Sony/Apple. Access time is, of course, somewhat important, but not as vital in the case of CDs as data transfer rate.  All the drives are double-speed drives with maximum data transfer rates of 300K/second. Any is a good choice. Apple's is very cheap when included with new Macs and I agree with Christian's comment about drivers.  Plus, Apple's is bootable on the Centris and Quadra 800. A very nice feature if you need to install System software. I don't know if the NEC or Toshiba are bootable on those machines.	0

(ie: must have 40pnt definition to print a 10pnt font)  When I upgraded,  I talked to Orange Micro, and they state that ver 1.2 of Grappler LS definitely works with System7.  However, the upgrade was US$40, so I passed.  Hope this helps?  <marc>  -- 	0
reconditioned at a (still Well, sounds like we need some kind of a Lemon Law on the hardware industry.  After all it does sound unfair to me for someone that has paid the price of a new drive for a reconditioned one.  What do you guys think? 	0
"   Dynamic RAM is not based on flip-flops; there's basically a single transistor and capacitor to store each bit!  Static RAM is based on flip-flops, and is much more expensive and much less dense.

Here is the story: I have a network with 4 Macs on Localtalk. One of them has an Ethernet Card, and is currently connected to a NeXT (don't laugh I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi). The NeXT is connected to the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem.  Currently, we can telnet from the Mac w/ Ethernet to the NeXT, and then telnet out again to the rest of the world.  What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT via the Ethernet Mac. From what we have heard, AIR doesn't do the trick.  Software solutions would be good too, but my impression is that there aren't going to be any.  Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet out again. The SLIP connection doesn't allow us to assign IP numbers to machines, so everyone shares that 1 number...oh well...  thanks in advance.	0
I have a (very old) Mac 512k and a Mac Plus, both of which  have the same problem.  Their screens blank out, sometimes after a minor physical jolt (such as inserting a floppy in the internal drive), sometimes  all by themselves (computer left to itself just goes blank).  I have replaced the wires connecting the logic boards and the  video board, because it seemed at first that jiggling the wires made the screen come back on.  This worked for a while, but the blanking out has returned.  Can I do anything?  Do I need a new power supply?  A new CRT? A new computer?  Thanks for any advice...  -------------------------- Ethan Bodin Tufts University ebodin@pearl.tufts.edu	0

Hi ... Recently I found XV for MS-DOS in a subdirectory of GNU-CC (GNUISH). I  use frequently XV on a Sun Spark Station 1 and I never had problems, but when I start it on my computer with -h option, it display the help menu and when I start it with a GIF-File my Hard disk turns 2 or 3 seconds and the prompt come back.  My computer is a little 386/25 with copro, 4 Mega rams, Tseng 4000 (1M) running MS-DOS 5.0 with HIMEM.SYS and no EMM386.SYS. I had the GO32.EXE too... but no driver who run with it.  Do somenone know the solution to run XV ??? any help would be apprecied..

G'day all,  Can anybody point me at a utility which will read/convert/crop/whatnot/ display HDF image files ? I've had a look at the HDF stuff under NCSA  and it must take an award for odd directory structure, strange storage approaches and minimalist documentation :-)  Part of the problem is that I want to look at large (5MB+) HDF files and crop out a section. Ideally I would like a hdftoppm type of utility, from which I can then use the PBMplus stuff quite merrily. I can convert the cropped part into another format for viewing/animation.  Otherwise, can someone please explain how to set up the NCSA Visualisation S/W for HDF (3.2.r5 or 3.3beta) and do the above cropping/etc. This is for Suns with SunOS 4.1.2.  Any help GREATLY appreciated. Ta muchly !

Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of doing this.  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading this group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5 different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum for discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way? Just curious. 	0
Hello again netters,  I finally received the information about Imagine for the PC.  They are presently shipping Version 2.0 of the software and will release Version 3.0 in the first quarter of 1993 (or so they say).  The upgrade from 2.0 to 3.0 is $100.00.  To purchase Imagine 2.0, it costs $495.00 or if you are upgrading from another eligible (call them for info) modeler, it is only $200.00 plus shipping & handling.   It requires a PC with 4 Megs a Math Coprocessor, and Dos 5.0 or up and a Microsoft Mouse and SVGA card.  Thanks for all your replies about the product.  I have received many contrasting replies, but once I scrounge the money together, I think I will take the plunge.  Thanks again.

"Yes I am aware CorelDraw exports in SCODAL. Version 2 did it quite well, apart from a few hassles with radial fills. Version 3 RevB is better but if you try to export in SCODAL with a bitmap image included in the drawing it will say something like ""cannot export SCODAL with bitmap""- at least it does on my version.  If anyone out there knows a way around this I am all ears.  Temporal images make a product called Filmpak which converts Autocad plots to SCODAL, postscript to SCODAL and now GIF to SCODAL but it costs $650 and I was just wondering if there was anything out there that just did the bitmap to SCODAL part a tad cheaper."	0

Hello,     I've recently had Povray draw about 10 sample files. The problem is that I accidently erased the command in my povray.def that made the image a targas file. So now the files are the dump format. How do I fix these files with out having to re-trace them? By fix I mean, turn them into targas.

 The best program I've seen for viewing such files is VPIC.  You'll want version 5.9 or later.  (6.0x is current.)  It allows you to view in 15 and 24 bit modes.  It really is QUITE nice.  Now, for a return question:  Do you run Windows?  If so, what are the dates on your drivers?  The newest ones *I* can find are from around 4-??-92!!  My problem is they conflict with Star Trek: After Dark, and other things as well.  I'm willing to bet that it's the drivers, and NOT the programs.  Anyone out there have info on newer SS24 (NOT X) drivers for windows or OS/2?	0
Hi.  The RTrace ray tracer supports 3D text as a primitive, not collections of spheres, cylinders and so on... The 3D chars are made of lines and splines that are extruded...  Please have a look at asterix.inescn.pt [192.35.246.17] in directory pub/RTrace. In pub/RTrace/tmp there are some demo images with high quality text. All of them are called Text?.jpg (JPEG encoded).

Features include:  - loading and saving bit-images (called blocks from herein) - flipping, resizing and warping blocks - loading and saving palette, fading, several in memory at once - graphics primitives such as line, circle, bar, rectangle - region fill (not the usually useless floodfill) - sprites (animated bitmaps), up to 200 onscreen at once - joystick/mouse support - SB support (VOC and CMF) - tile-based game creation using 16*16 pixel tiles to create   a 320*200 tile map (or game world) like in Duke Nuke 'Em - number of sprites increased to 1000 - Professional Sprite Creator utility and Map Maker -  routines to simplify scrolling games using maps, etc - FLI playing routines, sprites can be animated over the FLI while playing - PCX support, soon GIF - EMS/XMS coming soon as well  Leave E-mail to Barry Egerter at    egerter@obelix.gaul.csd.uwo.ca  Files available on:      (use  mget wgt*.zip)  SIMTEL20 and mirrors                pd1:<msdos.turbo-c>  nic.funet.fi                        pub/msdos/games/programming	0
I was chaining around in the anonymous ftp world looking for 3D Studio meshes and other interesting graphical stuff for the program, and found a few files with the extension 3D2.  My 3DS v2.01 doesn't know this type of file, so what are they?  And of course, the perennial... Where are some meshes, fli files, etc. out there?   I would have thought that someone would have collected a few and put them somewhere, but alas I am without this knowledge.  mucho appreciato	0
Hello,	0
Yes, there are serveral programs which can convert font files (eq the Borland fonts) to objects consisting of spheres, cones etc.  I've used a program (forgot its name/place, but i can look for it) which converted these Borland fonts to three different raytracers. Vivid, POV and Polyray (which i like more (more flexibel/faster/use of expressions etc). The program has a lot nice features. So if interested give me a mail.	0
I'm currently looking for information about different graphics formats, especially PPM, PCX BMP and perhaps GIF. Does anyone know if there exist any files at some site that describes these formats ???  Thanks !  	0
 Gamepro magazine published pictures a few months ago and Computer Chronicles (a program that is syndicated to public tv stations around the nation) spent several minutes on it when it was shown at CES.  It was very impressive what it can do in real time.  John Munsch	0
-> I am looking for source-code for the radiosity-method.   I don't know what kind of machine you want it for, but the program Radiance comes with 'C' source code - I don't have ftp access so I couldn't tell you where to get it via that way.	0

 I've got the 6.0 spec (obviously since I quoted it in my last posting).  My gripe about TIFF is that it's far too complicated and nearly infinitely easier to write than to read, which I think hurts your acceptance by anything that will need to read those images (e.g., paint programs).  In a nutshell, I don't think TIFF is salvageable unless the fat is trimmed significantly- and then it wouldn't be TIFF anymore.  They keep trying to cut it back, but it's late now.  Maybe they >will< fix it, and change that magic number to signify the lack of compatibility.  That would probably make me happy.	0

For some reason I never saw the original post on this thread, but if you are looking for fast polygon routines on vga on a PC, you really can't go past the mode X stuff from Dr Dobbs. This code is all p.domain (as far as I know), and in the original articles, the routines were all presented as dumb vga routines, and then optimised to modeX with some interesting discussion along the way. If you are interested, I could find out more details of the issues in question, (I have them at home).	0
On sunsite.unc.edu in pub/multimedia/utilities/unix find   mpeg_play-2.0.tar.Z.  I find for mono it works best as mpeg_play -dither threshold     though you can use            mpeg_play -dither mono  Face it, this is not be the best viewing situation.  Also someone has made a patch for mpeg_play that gives two more mono modes  (mono2 and halftone).  They are by jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au (Jan Newmarch). And the patch can be found on csc.canberra.edu.au (137.92.1.1) under /pub/motif/mpeg2.0.mono.patch. 	0

RADIOSITY SOURCES WANTED !!! ============================  When I read the comp.graphics group, I never found something about  radiosity. Is there anybody interested in out there? I would be glad  to hear from somebody. I am looking for source-code for the radiosity-method. I have already read common literature, e. g.Foley ... . I think little examples could  help me to understand how radiosity works. Common languages ( C, C++,  Pascal) prefered. I hope you will help me!	0
  Well....I don't know about its competing with 3D studio, but it's pretty powerful allright.    Yes, send e-mail to:   imagine-request@email.sp.paramax.com   With a header of something like subscribe.    I actually work on the FAQ (frequently asked questions).  We should have the new version out of it by next week, but if you want, I could e-mail you the previous one.  It details what the list is etc... as well as answering basic questions about Imagine.   Hope this helps!  	0
Does anybody know what Delaunay Triangulation is? Is there any reference to it?  Is it useful for creating 3-D objects? If yes, what's the advantage?  Thanks in advance.	0
hi all,  IN SHORT: looking for very fast assembly code for line/circle drawing    on SVGA graphics.  COMPLETE:  I am thinking of a simple but fast molecular graphics program to write on PC or clones. (ball-and-stick type)  Reasons: programs that I've seen are far too slow for this purpose.  Platform: 386/486 class machine.    800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics   (speed is important, 16-color for non-rendering    purpose is enough; may stay at 800x600 for    speed reason.)          (hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA           cards.  My own card is based on Trident 8900c, not VESA?)  What I'm looking for? 1) fast, very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes    on above-mentioned SVGA resolutions.    Presumably in assembly languagine.  Yes, VERY FAST please. 2) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen.    Drawings for beginning, would be lines, circles mainly, think of    text, else later.    (you know, the way molecular graphics rotates, zooms a molecule) 2) and any other codes (preferentially in C) that can help the     project.  Final remarks;- non-profit.  expected to become share-, free-ware.   Any help is appreciated.  thanks  -Frankie lau@tammy.harvard.edu	0
 Hi, It might be nice to know, what's possible on different hard ware platforms. But usually the hard ware is fixed ( in my case either Unix or DOS- PC ). So I'm not much interested in Amiga news.   In the case of Software, I won't get any comercial software mentioned in this newgroup to run on a Unix- platform, so I'm not interested in this information.  I would suggest to split the group. I don't see the problem of cross-posting. Then you need to read just 2 newgroups with half the size.   BUT WHAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE A FAQ. THIS WOULD REDUCE THE TRAFFIC A LOT.  Sincerely, Gerhard	0

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help. Don't overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DEC's FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,   and having a line containing the word 'help'.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the ""reply"" or ""answer"" command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.  BITFTP ------   For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.   Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.  Lightwave 3D mail based file-server -----------------------------------   A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images   and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.   The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list   and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for   several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.    The server resides on a BBS called ""The Graphics BBS"".  The BBS is   operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1   908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144   V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.    If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,   please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:   server@bobsbox.rent.com.

   Hello, I know that this has been discussed before.  But at the time I didn't need to teselate a sphere.  So if any kind soul has the code or the alg, that was finally decided upon as the best (as I recall it was a nice, iterative subdivision meathod), I would be very  appreciative.

Getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape is harder than it looks.  The standard VGA and EGA outputs are  very different than the NTSC format used by televisions.  While there is equipment that will do the conversion, it is hard to get your hands on and costs quite a bit.   If you have access to an Amiga computer, that has an NTSC output, you can transfer certain types of graphic files by modem and tape them from the NTSC output.  Unfortunately, this would be frame-by-frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchy animation unless you had a good Amiga animation program.	0
Actually I am trying to write something like this but I encounter some problems, amongst them:  - drawing a 3d wireframe view of a quadric/quartic requires that you have the explicit equation of the quadric/quartic (x, y, z functions of some parameters). How to convert the implicit equation used by PoV to an explicit one? Is it mathematically always possible?	0
 A very good modeling package I found is `irit' (look for irit.tar.Z). However there is no converter from it's format to POV format. I postet  a request for such a converter in this group but got no response, so I'm considering to write such a program myself.  	0
I'm getting ready to buy a multimedia workstation and would like a little advice.  I need a graphics card that will do video in and out under windows. I was originally thinking of a Targa+ but that doesn't work under Windows. What cards should I be looking into?  Thanks, Craig 	0
Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...  I'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I can help a little.    Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames per second).     It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations.  Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes.  Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.  From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.    You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. There are off-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster, being targeted directly at the VR application developer. Some of the most popular are (in no particular order):   - Division Inc.      (Redwood City, CA) - dVS  - Sens8 Inc.      (Sausalito, CA)    - WorldToolKit  - Naval Postgraduate School (Monterey, CA)     - NPSnet (FREE!)  - Gemini Technology Corp    (Irvine, CA)       - GVS Simation Series  - Paradigm Simulation Inc.  (Dallas, TX)       - VisionWorks, AudioWorks  - Silicon Graphics Inc.     (Mountain View,CA) - IRIS Performer  There are some others, but not off the top of my head...     There are too many to list here, but here is a smattering:   - Fake Space Labs     (Menlo Park,CA)    - BOOM  - Virtual Technologies Inc. (Stanford, CA)     - CyberGlove  - Digital Image Design     (New York, NY)     - The Cricket (3D input)  - Kaiser Electro Optics     (Carlsbad, CA)     - Sim Eye Helmet Displays  - Virtual Research     (Sunnyvale, CA)    - Flight Helmet display  - Virtual Reality Inc.     (Pleasantville,NY) - Head Mtd Displays, s/w  - Software Systems     (San Jose, CA)     - 3D Modeling software  - etc., etc., etc.     Read some of the VR books on the market:   - Virtual Reality - Ken Pimental and Ken Texiera (sp?)  - Virtual Mirage  - Artificial Reality - Myron Kreuger  - etc.  Or check out the newsgroup sci.virtual_worlds  Feel free to contact me for more info.

 I think one (not ideal) solution is to use the tracing utility (can't remember the name, sorry!) included in the Corel Draw s/w pack.  It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap. Result - the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODAL'ed no problem!  BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the solution less than idea, is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments.  So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image.  The obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping out the extra points by hand using Corel.  OUCH! I've done it a few times :-]                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  As I say, if you don't mind the problems, go via the route... BITMAP -> COREL (VIA TRACE) -> HAND TRIMMING (USING COREL)!!! -> COMBINE WITH MAIN COREL PIC (VIA IMPORT) -> SCODAL	0

"Hello, I purchased my new 486 with a NoName graphics card installed which is obviously  Speedstar 24 compatible. Its name is ""VGA 4000 TrueColor"".

Nowhere else, except in the ad, is any pointer to the TrueColor mode. Some articles in this group about the Speedstar 24 and some other facts made me believe that my card is compatible to that one.

          Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case with no solution that worried me.  Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere  that they are on the surface of. Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the surface of.  These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design meet these problems neatly.  When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite R. When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities they are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle) they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.  This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced  it can also be achieved by  If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle.   It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar. The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar. (4 points being colinear => coplanar)  Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points has been found is trivial.  	0

 Acorn Replay running on a 25MHz ARM 3 processor (the ARM 3 is about 20% slower than the ARM 6) does this in software (off a standard CD-ROM). 16 bit colour at about the same resolution (so what if the computer only has 8 bit colour support, real-time dithering too...). The 3D0/O is supposed to have a couple of DSPs - the ARM being used for housekeeping.   A 25MHz ARM 6xx should clock around 20 ARM MIPS, say 18 flat out. Depends really on the surrounding system and whether you are talking ARM6x or ARM6xx (the latter has a cache, and so is essential to run at this kind of speed with slower memory).  I'll stop saying things there 'cos I'll hopefully be working for ARM after graduation...

"Hi:  I am digitizing a NTSC signal and displaying on a PC video monitor. It is known that the display response of tubes is non-linear and is sometimes said to follow Gamma-Law. I am not certain if these non-linearities are ""Gamma-corrected"" before encoding NTSC signals or if the TV display is supposed to correct this.   Also, if  256 grey levels, for example, are coded in a C program do these intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a PC monitor? In other words does PC monitor display circuitry correct for ""gamma errrors""?   Your response is much appreciated.   Amjad."	0

I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing  away the afternoons since.  The programmes are all a bit buggy and definitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses, but they are very well written.   The interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once you figure out the tricks.  I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph without using the splines option.  Not sure why, since I don't have the source.  I think it was written for TP 6.0.  If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing  to work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first time just to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then  it would work... 	0

"Visual Numerics Inc. (formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0  and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent Graphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through  June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with  ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge  tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.   X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:   1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types    available through a large collection of X resources. 2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers. 3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization. 4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback. 5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget     library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar     to X programmers. 6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.    This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical    layout of an application.   C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:   1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library    is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C    standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C. 2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse     interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control    with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization. 3. Large collection of high-level application functions for ""two-call""    graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available    with minimal programming effort. 4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling    the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot    the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can     control the event loop.

Hi.  I'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database format used by a 3D graphics program I've written.  My program stores the points of a polygon in CCW order.  I've used 3D Concepts a  little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn.  Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the  points are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert, but if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know  which direction the polygon should be visible from.  If DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround? The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.  But that doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed...  Thanks in advance for any help,	0
"I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working code, which I will also include.  The intersection of 3 planes method looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in  Graphics Gems I doesn't work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.  I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution of linear equations).  To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say, P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the ""normalized"" vector from P1 to P2. These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points (for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like I need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which will require bringing in another routine I don't have (but should be easy to find).  Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define the circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel.

"  I agree with you about the upgrade path; but I think I was fair.  The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones, and (2) that DEC did.  On statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computer companies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market position/share).  In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the system.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (in computer lifetimes) relatively old.  On statement (2), I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not far superior than the industry ""average"", and that, in my opinion, SGI's history is better than DEC's.

Hi everyone,  I thought that some people may be interested in my VR software on these groups:  *******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******  Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality system, primarily focused on entertainment/research.  Features:     Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.    No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).    Generic clients.    Customizable servers.    Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).    Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).    Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily         attached.  Functionality:    Client:    The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's    viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's    actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users.     The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.     This release of the client software supports the following functionality:      o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)      o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)      o User Interface Panels      o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for  faster frame rates)      o Mouse and Keyboard Input     (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the    PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because    I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)    Server(s):    This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers:      o Transparent Client Management      o Client Message Handling     This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.     Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:      o Server Selectable Extension Installation:         What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension         initialisers you want.      o Event Handler Registration:         When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.         (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)      o Collision Detection Registration:         If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software.         Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.      This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose.      The following is all you need to make a World Server application:      o Provide an initWorld function:         This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus         any initialization you want to do.      o Provide a positionObject function:         This is where you determine where to place a new client.      o Provide an installWorldObjects function:         This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.      o Provide a getWorldType function:         This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.      o Provide an animateWorld function:         This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects         move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit         (to avoid outrunning the clients).      That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers I've provided:          generic - 81 lines         dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs! Will probably be improved with future                            versions)         dogfight - 72 lines  Location:     This software is located at the following site:    ftp.u.washington.edu     Directory:    pub/virtual-worlds     File:    multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z  Futures:     Client:      o Texture mapping.      o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading      o HMD support.      o Etc, etc....     Server:      o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).      o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction      o Etc, etc....     Both:      o Improved Comms!!!  I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse software, unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(  I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!  Finally one major disclaimer:  This is totally amateur code. By that I mean there is no support for this code other than what I, out the kindness of my heart, or you, out of pure desperation, provide. I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!  Disclaimer over!

[Please, note the Newsgroups.]  Recent discussion about XV's problems were held in some newsgroup. Here is some text users of XV might find interesting. I have added more to text to this collection article, so read on, even you so my articles a while ago.  I hope author of XV corrects those problems as best he can, so fine program XV is that it is worth of improving. (I have also minor ideas for 24bit XV, e-mail me for them.)  Any misundertanding of mine is understandable.   Juhana Kouhia   ==clip==  [ ..deleted..]  Note that 'xv' saves only 8bit/rasterized images; that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality. Also, there's three kind of 8bit quantizers; your final image quality depends on them too.   This were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago.   IMHO, it is design error of 'xv'; there should not be such confusing errors in programs. There's two errors:   -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the    original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of    original 24bit should be a special case   -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer    -- the main case should be that 'xv' quantizes the image with the    best quantizer available before saving the image to a file; lousier    quantizers should be just for viewing purposes (and a special cases    in saving the image, if at all)   ==clip==  ==clip==  [ ..deleted..]  It is limit of *XV*, but not limit of design. It is error in design. It is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs; jpeg is not designed to that.  As matter of fact, I'm sure when XV were designed 24bit displays were known. It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only at that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support 24bit images. That were not done and now we have  -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)  -the program has human interface errors.  Otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.  [ ..deleted.. ]  ==clip==  Some new items follows.  ==clip==  I have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24 option than with default option we have. The reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise) the same than used in ppmquant.  If you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found that rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv (our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly -- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.  I don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no. So, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.  I suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission. (Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I can say nothing about it.)  ==clip==  ==clip==  Some minor bugs in human interface are:  Key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens that I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong place. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away immediately. The buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.  Also, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for XV after the image is completed. Often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when I'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings then go to XV and image has gone or something weird.  In the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV updates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first and then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be updated when the setting are not ready yet. I suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.	0

Hi! Everyone,  Since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from 4 points, I suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse from its offset. For example, given 5 points on the offset, can you find the original ellipse analytically?  I spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year, but I failed. Under the pressure, I had to use other method - nonlinear programming technique to deal with this problem approximately.  Any ideas will be greatly appreciated. Please post here, let the others share our interests.	0
 For better worse, the source on this on is Michael Barnsley. His article in The Science of Fractal Images (Peitgen et al) is a fair-to-middling intro. Barnsley's book Fractals Everywhere is a more thorough treatment. The book covers Iterated Function Systems in general, and their application to image compression is clear from the text.	0

Hi to all out there.  We have this problem, and I'm not certain I'm solving it in the correct way.  I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this, or point me in the right place to look...  We have an X-ray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole passing through it at a right angle to the tube's axis:                                                            |                                      ||                   [ image                                                           |   X-ray source ]                     ||                   | screen                             metallic || tube              |                                      ||                   |                                                           |  We know source--screen centre distance, radius of the tube, radius of the hole.  We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen.  However, the calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that the object's hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen.  However, it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently.    Firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?  Secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar (the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen).  How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion?  So, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?  We'd appreciate any help, either posted or emailed.  Thanks in advance, Simon.	0
Sorry for wasting your time with a probably simple question, but I'm not an computer graphic expert. I want to read TIFF-Files with a PASCAL-program. The problem is, that the files I want to read are in compressed form  ( code 1, e.g. Huffman ). All books & articles I found describe only the plain (uncompressed) format. I don't know where to get the original TIFF specification, furthermore I haven't any access to a realy complete library. Can anybody direct me to a good book or (even better) to an  specification available via ftp ?  Thanks in advance - Thomas Wolf	0

" Off the top of my head, I might try:  Given: p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4  Find:  p_c (center of sphere determined by p_1, ..., p_4),         dist(p_c, p_i) (radius)  p_c is the same distance from our four points, so dist(p_c,p_1) = dist(p_c,p_2) = dist(p_c,p_3) = dist(p_c,p_4)   Of course, we can square the whole thing to get rid of square roots: distsq(p_c,p_1) = distsq(p_c,p_2) = distsq(p_c,p_3) = distsq(p_c,p_4)   Plug in the variables into the distance formula, simplify, and the  x^2_c, y^2_c, and z^2_c terms cancel out, leaving you with three  linearly independent equations and three unknowns (x_c, y_c, z_c).

From article <C5owCB.n3p@world.std.com>, by tombaker@world.std.com (Tom A Baker):   My understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically known bugs in the warning system software - things are checked that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't set till after launch, and suchlike. Rather than fix the code and possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew 'ok, if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff, ignore it'.	0

"Hi,     I was reading through ""The Spaceflight Handbook"" and somewhere in there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to the sun in a hyperbolic orbit. The magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very long-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of course. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration? Can this be extended to larger accelerations?"	0
"      What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?  Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution, crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.     Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?     Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?     Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)  As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the Andromeda's bursters.  The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is ""the edge of the Universe"" ;-) If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.   If we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.  The situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]     my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering    hyperspace :-)     but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they    are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered    if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

  Fred.   Try reading a bit.  THe government does lots of multi year contracts with Penalty for cancellation clauses.  They just like to be damn sure they know what they are doing before they sign a multi year contract.

 Any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections, and when its fuel runs out it will crash within months.  The orbits of the Apollo motherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a few days.  It is *possible* that there are stable orbits here and there -- the Moon's gravitational field is poorly mapped -- but we know of none.  Perturbations from Sun and Earth are relatively minor issues at low altitudes.  The big problem is that the Moon's own gravitational field is quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the Moon.	0

This might a real wierd idea or maybe not..  I have seen where people have blown up ballons then sprayed material into them that then drys and makes hard walls...  Why not do the same thing for a space station..  Fly up the docking rings and baloon materials and such, blow up the baloons, spin then around (I know a problem in micro gravity) let them dry/cure/harden? and cut a hole for the docking/attaching ring and bingo a space station..  Of course the ballons would have to be foil covered or someother radiation protective covering/heat shield(?) and the material used to make the wals would have to meet the out gasing and other specs or atleast the paint/covering of the inner wall would have to be human safe.. Maybe a special congrete or maybe the same material as makes caplets but with some changes (saw where someone instea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture, got a mix that was just as strong as congret but easier to carry around and such..)  Sorry for any spelling errors, I missed school today.. (grin)..  Why musta  space station be so difficult?? why must we have girders? why be confined to earth based ideas, lets think new ideas, after all space is not earth, why be limited by earth based ideas??	0

 The Proton has been used in 2, 3, and 4 stage versions.  The two stage version was used for the first 3 launches, while the 3 and 4 stage versions are used today.  The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?) orbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.  Since this is the version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir), as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fit under the shroud.  I vaguely recall that the Russians are developing a LH2/LOX upper stage for the Proton.	0
  Well it rolled out two weeks ago. As we speak it is at White Sands getting ready. I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out of town (in NM).  As for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work on SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have some. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital prototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with major modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.  Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of this program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next year for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.  Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made for spending half on DC.  Public support is STILL critical. Meet with your Congressperson (I'll help you do it) and get his/her support. Also call your local media ans get them to cover the flight tests.     Allen	0
  Well, there already is a sulfate process for TiO2 purification.  The chlorine process is cleaner, however, and for that reason is achieving dominance in the marketplace.  Most Ti is used in pigment, btw (as the oxide), where it replaced white lead pigment some decades ago.  Very little is reduced to the metal.   Which merely evades the issue of why those lunatics are there at all (and, why their children would want to stay.)	0
";From the article ""What's New"" Apr-16-93 in sci.physics.research: ; ;........ ;WHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC ; ;1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE ""SPINOFFS"" WE WERE PROMISED? ;What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that ;it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night). ;Is NASA really supporting this junk? ;Are protesting groups being organized in the States? ;Really, really depressed. ; ;             Enzo  I wouldn't worry about it.  There's enough space debris up there that a mile-long inflatable would probably deflate in some very short period of time (less than a year) while cleaning up LEO somewhat. Sort of a giant fly-paper in orbit.  Hmm, that could actually be useful.  As for advertising -- sure, why not?  A NASA friend and I spent one drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization on the face of the Moon.  Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning."	0
  What do you mean? Are you saying they thought the effort was profitable or that the money was efficiently spent (providing max value per money spent)?  I think they would answer yes on ballance to both questions. Exceptions would be places like the US from the French Indian War to the end of the US Revolution.   But even after the colonies revolted or where given independance the British engaged in very lucrative trading with the former colonies. Five years after the American Revolution England was still the largest US trading partner.    Allen 	0
"""Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be Impossible""  Today (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the headline shown above. The article starts with ""A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible."" O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research ""is a real question for me."" O'Connor said ""everything is fair game,"" including ""dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry, chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country, working closely with the Russian space station Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet.""  O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost.  The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [""wingless Orbiter""] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a ""moderate"" cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the ""high cost"" option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as ""one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure."""	0

" Wishful thinking mostly. It's more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,  and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat  sink capacity could offer some military utility for ""high ground"" military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space  travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as  Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor  activity in the global scope of things.  Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries, if not much longer.  Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little ultimate profit either.  Gary"	0
Hello everyone,   I was hoping someone could help me out.  I'm writing a program  for my astronautics class for assent of the shuttle into a low  orbit.  There are two things I'd like to know, First, how much   time elapses between launch and the pitch over. Second, what is  the cross-sectional area of the shuttle, srb's, and ext. tank.   Thanks for any information, post or e-mail.	0

I've been following discussions about the Delta Clipper program, and I have one small question.  As I understand it, the DC-X derived orbital vehicle (DC-Y & 1) is to reenter the atmosphere sort of sideways, not completely nose-first.  So why is the DC-Y look symmetric in every drawing I've seen?  I would think that an asymmetric design, sort of like  wingless Orbiter, may work better, since less shielding is required on the top side.  Can anybody explain?    - Ken Kobayashi kkobayas@husc.harvard.edu  -- 	0
  George.   It's called a democracy.  The majority rules.  sorry. If ytou don't like it, I suggest you modify the constitution to include a constitutional right to Dark Skies.   The theory of government here is that the majority rules,  except in the nature of fundamental civil rights.   If you really are annoyed,   get some legislation to create a dark sky zone,  where in all light emissions are protected in the zone.  Kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  Did you know about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia, they have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can prevent you from running light AC motors, like air conditioners and Vacuums. In practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.	0
"   I hate to pour cold water on this, but currently seawater extracted uranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from Japan, is about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market. Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources (for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before uranium reached $200/lb.  ""Demand and supply balance will collapse"" is nonsense.  Supply and demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century? Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built at a sufficient rate.  Uranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of self-sufficiency."	0

Is anybody out there willing to discuss with me careers in the Army that deal with space?  After I graduate, I will have a commitment to serve in the Army,  and I would like to spend it in a space-related field.

"I'm not very impressed by the old so-called ""prospecting"" work from LPI, it has almost all been geared towards industrially silly processes on the moon as an excuse to put astronauts there.   [...]  Translation:  It doesn't support the Nick Szabo Vision of the Future to Which You MUST Subscribe...  Fred, we're all supporting what each of us thinks should be done, to some degree.  If you have a problem with what Nick thinks should be done, address it, instead of just complaining about his doing so.  You really don't get what the 'complaints' are about, do you?   [not incredibly clear explanation of complaints...something between    feelings regarding Nick's method, and judgments about his meaning]  T  F  *** Fred's issue #1;  Nick's alleged trashing of others ***  I only got it when you stopped trashing, and made your point patently, instead of 'allegorically'.  That was my point all along, Fred.      I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last point.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective point-of-view?  And, as usual, you defend your insults with ""he started it.""  ""Yeah, I took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.""  ""So what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.""  Besides that, I think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it. So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.  Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  ""I never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you gave it to me.""  Make up yer mind, Fred!      First, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded with a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am not clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly interpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win, can I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that between stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.   *** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***  Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had.  My reading of what Nick actually said is that ""people aren't required in all parts of all space processes"", so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program, I read as ""People are required in all parts of all space processes.""  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm so patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat your terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)  The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your job, Fred.  And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points, simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan' that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone.   No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made you imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though it's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself.      Of course, Socrates.  How could it be otherwise?   Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years. If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's no worse than your own.  Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling isn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might see it better, Fred.  ""Net.ghod wannabe""?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted my motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as your insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a jerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands. Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.  Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) job with NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well, I just hope you're happy.  Please leave me alone, now.  I just don't have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me.

I applaud the SDIO for funding DC-X devlopment and I hope it works, and, no, launcher development is not NASAs primary goal either, IMHO they are supposed to provide the enabling technology research for others to do launcher development, and secondarily operate such launchers as they require - but that's just me.	0

 Nope, you're confusing separate programs.  Atlas was the first-generation US ICBM; Titan I was the second-generation one; Titan II, which all the Titan launchers are based on, was the third-generation heavy ICBM.  There was essentially nothing in common between these three programs.  (Yes, *three* programs.  Despite the similarity of names, Titan I and Titan II were completely different missiles.  They didn't even use the same fuels, never mind the same launch facilities.) 	0
The European Space Agency has involvement with remote earth  observation, and I presume this includes surveillance (optical etc.). So it's not just the US/USSR(ex) who are in the game.  But what *is* the game? What can be done with space observation? The military functions of missile spotting, troop spotting etc. are well documented, but what about anything else?  The biggest eg I can think of is to get a  metal sensing sat over a paying country and scan their territory for  precious metals.  More importantly, if radar can spot water vapour (clouds), presumably a radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers,open water and  *underground water* from space. This would be a positive life saver for African or other drought affected countries. Implementing a clean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to such countries and should cut down mortalities considerably.  So how about it? Is there a charity or government agency that would pay for a third world country to have their minerals and water deposits mapped?  Or is this still sci-fi?  Mail replies would be great.

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9, all payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning beginning at 10:30 AM.  Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator testing will take place on Monday .  The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument. This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.	0
  As an Amateur Radio operator (VHF 2metres) I like to keep up with what is  going up (and for that matter what is coming down too).   In about 30 days I have learned ALOT about satellites current, future and  past all the way back to Vanguard series and up to Astro D observatory  (space).  I borrowed a book from the library called Weater Satellites (I  think, it has a photo of the earth with a TIROS type satellite on it.)

 Actually, the idea, like most good ideas, comes from Jules Verne, not _The Gods Must Be Crazy._  In one of his lesser known books (I can't remember which one right now), the protagonists are in a balloon gondola, travelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon, when one of them drops a fob watch.  They then speculate about the reaction of the natives to finding such a thing, dropped straight down from heaven. But the notion is not pursued further than that.	0
   Actually, that is no longer true. In the last few years Congress has ammended laws to provide whatever is needed. Note that both Spacehab and Comet are funded this way.  The problems aren't legal nor technical. The problem is NASA's culture.    Allen 	0
Could someone please send me the basics of the NASP project: 1. The proposal/objectives 2. The current status of the project/obstacles encountered 3. Chance that the project shall ever be completed or any other interesting information about this project.  Any help will be much appreciated 	0
"  The company was probably ""Public Missiles, Inc"" of Michigan.   Yup.   Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an ""F"" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.   That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about our hobby.   True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get  hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. "	0
Many of you at this point have seen a copy of the  Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act by now. This bill, also known as the Back to  the Moon bill, would authorize the U.S.  government to purchase lunar science data from private  and non-profit vendors, selected on the basis of competitive bidding, with an  aggregate cap on bid awards of $65 million.          If you have a copy of the bill, and can't or don't want to go through  all of the legalese contained in all Federal legislation,don't both - you have  a free resource to evaluate the bill for you. Your local congressional office,  listed in the phone book,is staffed by people who can forward a copy of the bill to legal experts. Simply ask them to do so, and to consider supporting the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act.          If you do get feedback, negative or positive, from your congressional  office, please forward it to: David Anderman 3136 E. Yorba Linda Blvd., Apt G-14, Fullerton, CA 92631, or via E-Mail to: David.Anderman@ofa123.fidonet.org.          Another resource is your local chapter of the National Space Society.  Members of the chapter will be happy to work with you to evaluate and support  the Back to the Moon bill. For the address and telephone number of the nearest  chapter to you, please send E-mail, or check the latest issue of Ad Astra, in  a library near you.         Finally, if you have requested, and not received, information about the Back to the Moon bill, please re-send your request. The database for the bill was recently corrupted, and some information was lost. The authors of the  bill thank you for your patience. 	0
"       TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the  Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The  satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section  housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof  mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The  proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation  pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered  around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.       TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The  2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a  single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be  powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).       Further info on TRIAD, DISCOS, etc. can be found in ""Spacecraft Design  Innovations in the APL Space Department,"" Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest,  Vol. 13, No. 1 (1992)."	0
    It may be that they just didn't mention it, or that they actually haven't  thought about it.  I got the vague impression from their mission proposal that they weren't taking a very holistic aproach to the whole thing.  They seemed to want to land people on the Moon by the end of the decade without  explaining why, or what they would do once they got there.  The only application I remember from the Av Week article was placing a telescope on the Moon.  That's great, but they don't explain why it can't be done robotically.     But I'm a _member_.  Besides Bill, I hang out with you :)  	0
Hi guys,  I've been hearing lots of talk on the net about DC-X and DC-Y, but none of the many posts actually explain what they are !!! Sorry if this is a FAQ, but would somebody please explain to me what they are. Reply by Email please . . . thanks.   Andy  ajjb@adam4.bnsc.rl.ac.uk -- 	0
"There has been something bothering me while watching NASA Select for a while.  Well, I should'nt say bothering, maybe wondering would be better.  When they are going to launch they say (sorry but I forget exactly who is saying what, OTC to PLT I think) ""Clear caution & warning memory.  Verify no unexpected errors. ..."".  I am wondering what an ""expected error"" might be.  Sorry if this is a really dumb question, but inquiring minds just gotta know............"	0
   There is a whole constellation of custom built navigation beacon satellites in the process of being phased out right now. The TRANSIT/OSCAR satellites are being replaced by GPS. Or were you thinking of deep space navigation, which is best done with doppler/VLBI/ stellar measurements. I do not think additional radio beacons would help much.	0
   Depends. If you assume the existance of a working SSTO like DC, on billion $$ would be enough to put about a quarter million pounds of stuff on the moon. If some of that mass went to send equipment to make LOX for the transfer vehicle, you could send a lot more. Either way, its a lot more than needed.  This prize isn't big enough to warrent developing a SSTO, but it is enough to do it if the vehicle exists.    Allen 	0

"I have a nice quote that I like (or as close as I can remember it).  If I say something that you think is crazy, ask me what I mean before you think its crazy..   So some of my ideas are a bit odd, off the wall and such, but so was Wilbur and Orville Wright, and quite a few others.. Sorry if I do not have the big degrees and such, but I think (I might be wrong, to error is human) I have something that is in many ways just as important, I have imagination, dreams. And without dreams all the knowledge is worthless..   Sorry my two cents worth. Or is it two rubles worth?  The basic quote idea is from H. Beam Pipers book ""Space Vikings"". Its a good book on how civilization can fall, and how it can be raised to new heights."	0
 The Orion concept as actually proposed (as opposed to the way it has been somewhat misrepresented in some fiction) included wrapping a thick layer of reaction mass -- probably plastic of some sort -- around each bomb. The bomb vaporizes the reaction mass, and it's that which transfers momentum to the pusher plate.	0
" The CU people have been, and continue to be big ozone scientists. So  this is consistent. It is also consistent with the new ""Comercial  applications"" that NASA and Clinton are pushing so hard.   Did anyone catch the rocket that was launched with a movie advert  all over it? I think the rocket people got alot of $$ for painting  up the sides with the movie stuff. What about the Coke/Pepsi thing  a few years back? NASA has been trying to find ways to get other  people into the space funding business for some time. Frankly, I've  thought about trying it too. When the funding gets tight, only the  innovative get funded. One of the things NASA is big on is co-funding.  If a PI can show co-funding for any proposal, that proposal has a SIGNIFICANTLY higher probability of being funded than a proposal with more merit but no  co-funding. Once again, money talks!  "	0
"Archive-name: space/data Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:07 $  ONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES, DATA, ETC.   INTRODUCTION      A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and     other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.     A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the     remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as     providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on     the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP     directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via     email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com     or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions     on how to make requests.      The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames     SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.      Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is     huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.   VIEWING IMAGES      The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly     large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To     read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,     use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu     (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP     sites.      The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image     formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document     is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at     pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory     pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.   ONLINE ARCHIVES      NASA AMES      Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via     anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and     a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press     releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please     note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.      FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in     pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the     archive (the index is about 200K by itself).      To access the archives by email, send a letter to     archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the     subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:   send SPACE Index  send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.      The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in     caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use     one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this     section for images or programs.      The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image     disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The     disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are     available in these collections.      The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory     contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in     the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is     found in the IMDISP directory (see the item ""VIEWING IMAGES"" below).      The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to     contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing     specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.      Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee     (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).       NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM      The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and     provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data     from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140     data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can     be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS     also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,     ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to     query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,     keywords, title words, or abstract text words.      ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to     become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu.

     >Very cost effective if you use the right accounting method :-)     Sherzer Methodology!!!!!!  Hell, yes. I'm not going to let a bunch of seven suits tell me what the right way to estimate cost effectiveness is, at least not until they can make their mind up long enough to leave their scheme stable for a fiscal year or two.   Seriously though. If you were to ask the British government whether their colonisation efforts in the Americas were cost effective, what answer do you think you'd get? What if you asked in 1765, 1815, 1865, 1915 and 1945 respectively? ;-)	0
  But with cheaper fuel from space based sources it will be cheaper to  reach more orbits than from the ground.  Also remember, that the presence of a repair/supply facility adds value to the space around it. If you can put your satellite in an orbit where it can be reached by a ready source of supply you can make it cheaper and gain benefit from economies of scale.    Allen	0

"      I note that you make no such case as you claim can be 'even more easily made'.  Yes, the argument can (and has) been made that current government policy creates even larger market barriers than there were in the first place, but there is no such term as 'government failure', since the government can change policies whenever it pleases.  The market doesn't do that and is governed by (relatively) well-understood forces.  This libertopican bilge about 'moral arguments' about taxation, etc., is, at bottom, so much simplistic economic thinking. It can only be 'justified' by cliche derision of anyone who knows more about economics than the libertopian -- which is what invariably happens.  Tripe a la Tommy, the new libertopian dish.

"Archive-name: space/probe Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:19 $  PLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS      This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes     (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression ""R-dot-bar sub n"" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a ""dead"" world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a ""dead"" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:       SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first       craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was       also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images       from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8       accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were       unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil        to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in        1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's        surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished        with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in        1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions         lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with         VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in         February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.         Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe         became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending         through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before         reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles         similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet         in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in         1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the         first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar         mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.   VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of   planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian       atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on       to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in       March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased       enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian       surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian       surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red       Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander       signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to       fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in       1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.       probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit       with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest         moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to         human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did         enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week         before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:   Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km  Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km  Inclination : 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)  Period  : 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and periodicals:      NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

Suppose the Soviets had managed to get their moon rocket working and had made it first.  They could have beaten us if either:  * Their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back,  and/or  * A Saturn V went boom.  If they had beaten us, I speculate that the US would have gone head and done some landings, but we also would have been more determined to set up a base (both in Earth Orbit and on the Moon).  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend upon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to Mars (at least in the short run).  Thus we would have concentrated on the moon. 	0

     > Why Paul, it's obvious.    > Once chlorine chemistry has been banned on Earth,    > as is being advocated by some groups, Ti prices will     > :-) :-) :-)      Well, there already is a sulfate process for TiO2 purification.  The    chlorine process is cleaner, however, and for that reason is achieving    dominance in the marketplace.  Darn, caught by the white hot heat of technological progress again...

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Contact:  OASIS (310) 364-2290     15 April 1993                                Los Angeles, CA       LOCAL NATIONAL SPACE SOCIETY CHAPTERS SPONSOR TALK BY L.A.   ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier. The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.         WHERE:  Rockwell Science Center Auditorium, 1049 Camino                Dos Rios, Thousand Oaks, CA.	0

 Well said.    Okay, Del, so Michael was being unfair, but you are being unfair back.   He is taking college courses now, I presume he is studying hard, and his postings reveal that he is *somewhat* hip to the technical issues of astronautics.  Plus, he is attentively following the erudite discourse of the Big Brains who post to sci.space; is it not inevitable that he will get a splendid technical education from reading the likes of you and me? [1]  Like others involved in sci.space, Mr. Adams shows symptoms of being a fledgling member of the technoculture, and I think he's soaking it up fast.  I was a young guy with dreams once, and they led me to get a technical education to follow them up.  Too bad I wound up in an assembly-line job stamping out identical neutrinos day after day...

 I would guess not.  Dr. Neil Gehrels of CGRO is the son of Dr. Tom Gehrels of the University of Arizona.  Since he's long had research interests in asteroids and other solar-system astronomy, Tom is the one more likely to have discovered  a comet (and thus had his name attached to it).  Tom Gehrels is a leader in the Spacewatch project, which has recently increased mankind's discovery rate on near-Earth asteroids (they're finding a couple every month).

"ARIANESPACE FLIGHT 56  (Flight V.56 was originally intended to carry the Hughes HS-601 series  Galaxy IV satellite, but the payload was withdrawn just prior to flight.)  The 56th Ariane launch is now scheduled to place the ASTRA 1C and ARSENE  satellites into an improved geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), with  inclination reduced to 5 degrees and apogee altitude increased by 150 km. This will be the 28th launch of an Ariane 4 and the first in the 42L  configuration, with 2 liquid strap-on boosters (PAL).  It will be launched from the newly refurbished Ariane launch complex ELA 2, in Kourou - French  Guiana.  The launch vehicle performance requirement for this mission is 3,147 kg of which 2,944 kg represents the satellite mass.  The total vehicle mass at liftoff is 361,778 kg.

" Could it be Public Missile, Inc in Michigan?  From the description of ad here, it sounds like they're talking about ""High Power Rocketry"", an outgrowth of model rocketry.  This hobby uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P.  The hobby has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular. Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.  Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a total impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch. Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and all of the launches are then covered under this ""blanket waiver"". There is also a ""High Power Safety Code"" which designates more specific rules such as launch field size, etc.  Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket  motors you need to certified through either the National Association of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association. Certification procedures require a demonstarted handling and ""safe"" flight at a total impulse level.  For more information, watch rec.models.rockets newsgroup."	0

      Phil> Didn't one of the early jet fighters have these?  I also think Phil> the germans did some work on these in WWII.  The NACA came up with them before World War II.  NASA is directly descended from the NACA, with space added in.  You'll notice that I didn't mention sweep wings even though the X-5, tested at what's now Dryden, had them.  We did steal that one dirctly from the Germans.  The difference is that swept wings don't change their angle of sweep, sweep wings do.  Perhaps the similarity of names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings, F-111s have sweep wings.   Phil> A lot of this was also done by the military...  After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams demonstrated them.  Richard Whitcomb and R.T. Jones, at Langley Research Center, were giants in the field.  Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area ruling (in the 70s and 50s, respectively).  It's true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement.  The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was bailed to us.  The Air Force, of course, was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts.  Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were. General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how successful we were.  (Mind you, the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog.)  Phil> Egad! I'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer!    The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.  On the other hand, all those second-hand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance to fold the wings--something most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base can't do.  	0
 Lets hear it for Dan Goldin...now if he can only convince the rest of our federal government that the space program is a worth while investment!  I hope that I will live to see the day we walk on Mars, but we need to address the technical hurdles first!  If there's sufficient interest, maybe we should consider starting a sci.space group  devoted to the technical analysis of long-duration human spaceflight. Most of you regulars know that I'm interested in starting this analysis as soon as possible.	0
" [Excellent discussion of DC-X landing techniques by Henry deleted]   The DC-X will not take of horizontally.  It takes of vertically.    For several reasons.  Vertical landings don't require miles of runway and limit noise pollution.  They don't require wheels or wings.  Just turn on the engines and touch down.  Of course, as Henry pointed out, vetical landings aren't quite that simple.   Well, to be blunt, yes.  But at least you're learning.   The Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets just before they hit the ground.  Parachutes are, however, not especially practical if you want to reuse something without much effort.  The landings are also not very comfortable.  However, in the words of Georgy Grechko, ""I prefer to have bruises, not to sink.""  "	0

a  What about positional uncertainties in S-L 1993e?   I assume we know where and what Galileo is doing within a few meters.   But without the HGA,  don't we have to have some pretty good ideas, of where to look before imaging?  If the HGA was working,  they could slew around in near real time (Less speed of light delay).  But when they were imaging toutatis????  didn't someone have to get lucky on a guess to find the first images?     Also, I imagine S-L 1993e will be mostly a visual image.  so how will that affect the other imaging missions.  with the LGA,  there is a real tight allocation of bandwidth.   It may be premature to hope for answers, but I thought i'd throw it on the floor.	0

I don't hear any of these other idiots doing a funny show and getting into some serious topics at the same time, he get's people to think and entertains them at the same time,  so try listening to his show a little closer before you tell them that they are WRONG, and by the way, if he is such a flash in the pan, why do his ratings sustain so well?

"     Actually all the liberals I've seen have deplored the burning of  children. I would far preferred that the Davidians had not set the  fire that burned themselves and their children to death, but I don't  believe that the responsibility for the fire (or the almost complete  absense of attempts to escape the blaze) can be placed at the door of  the Federal authorities.       Not so. My wife got me a convenient plastic ""drip pan"" for Christmas...       Yeah, those Nazis. You know how we liberals just love those Nazis.

" Was THAT your argument.  Well, you didn't make it very well.  You started  from the questionable premise that the fire was necessarily an act of insanity, rather than an act of negligence or an accident.  Recall, one survivor claims that the fire started when a tank knocked over a kerosene  lamp.  Kind of makes arguments regarding relative sanity somewhat moot, no?   ""Nice evasive maneuver, Mr. Chekov, but they're still on our tail.""  Let me ask it more plainly.  Which of the above complaints about David  Koresh's religious or sexual proclivities justified an armed raid by the  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms?      It's not entirely far-fetched.  Nobody outside the compound would know  EVERYBODY inside the compound.  Don't forget, the BATF admits having  agents inside the compound, in any case.   I'm simply being the devil's advocate.  There's reasonable doubt by the boatload standing in the way of anybody totally swallowing the official  government story on Waco. -- "	1
         As perhaps some insight into how this sort of thing works, the local college newspaper had a big crusade to have the U.T. police release crime stats.  (The school claimed that to do so would violate federal education records privacy laws).  They swore up and down they weren't interested in student discipline records, only for stats so people could make an evaluation of how safe the campus was.         It was barely a week after crime stats were released before the Daily Beacon had an editorial calling for student disciplinary stats to be released, because they complained certain segments of the campus population were treated administratively rather than turned over to the police and therefore the criminal states weren't accurate.         What people say they want public today may not be what they say tomorrow. 	1

  Just want to back this up with a personal anecdote.  My grandparents have a Navajo rug made in the 1920's, which they received in trade  from the weaver while living in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The decorative motif consists of 4 large black swastikas, one in each corner.  What's more, the color scheme is black, white, and red.  To the casual glance it would undoubtedly appear to be a Nazi relic of some kind.  Yet they owned it ten years before Hitler and the National Socialists came to power.    As I recall, they took it down in the 30's, and didn't feel quite right about putting it back up until the 60's.  It still draws comments from  those who don't know what it is.  --ccm  --  Christopher C. May * U. of Ariz.

  Well, may I point out that paranoia is an IRRATIONAL fear, without basis in reality.  As we've seen here in the US, there is nothing irrational about it.  Perhaps you folks in Finland have been down on your knees being good little boys and girls so that the former Soviet Union didn't come across the border and stomp the snot out of you for so long that you just figure everybody should be so accomodating to tyranny.     If you don't like us talking about political issues involving attacks on people for owning guns, don't read talk.politics.guns.    Nobody's trying to save YOU from anything, so butt out.  I couldn't care less about what somebody on the other side of the world thinks  about this. Of course, you do have a right to an opinion...  but I've always figured that opinons are like hemmorhoids.  Every asshole's got them, I just don't care about yours.   	1
 I can't speak for the organizations you cited but everywhere you look in our society and government, one can see the relentless movement toward one world government.  The fact that the media demeans such charished  values as patriotism, nationalism and protectionism are some of the clues.  The fact that we are sapping the economic strength of americans to prop up a former and possibly future enemy is just another.  The fact the words like community of nations, global village and international business are in vogue are others.  International corporations are  destroying our identy and economy and the propaganda they are playing through the media and government is over powering our ability to resist. Our porous border both people and trade are an indiciation that we have already lost a great deal of sovergnty.  The bottome line is that the single most evil aspect of One World Government is that you have nowhere to run to and history has proven that would be a disaster.  	1
" Not so.  Surveys have shown while the public thinks certain types of gun control may be acceptable they do believe they have an individual right to keep and bear arms, and that the police should not have /discretion/ over who may and may not own firearms.   By the end of the Clinton administration a lot of things will be screwed up.  Hell, we'll probably be just like England.   ""Tough titty"" ?  My how eloquent you are.  As for your claim, I think Clinton has a big fight ahead of him if he thinks he's going to pass some comprehensive gun legislation. He will sign the Brady Bill if it gets to his desk.  We will do whatever we can to either keep that from happening, or modify it such that it is acceptable to us.   Sorry, that's not possible.  And that's why we won't give them up either.  Legally or illegally, American's will keep their firearms. The number of unregistered weapons in New York City is in the millions. There aren't even close to that number of violent criminals there.   If the gov't was serious about stopping violent crime they would keep violent criminals in jail for a long long time where they belong instead of letting them out on early release.   Hey, we can go into politics too if we feel like it.   I don't believe this one bit.   Snore.  Like I take advice on the RKBA from a Brit.  No way.   You watch too much ""Star Trek"".  Actually, this is an understandable attitude from a Brit; you are a subject of the state.   Not necessarily.  There are ways of resisting oppression without getting caught by the gov't.   The ""abstract criminal"" like the ones who killed a relative of mine while she was working in a carry-out.   While undesirable, they are sometimes unavoidable.  If you don't want to resist a criminal attack by all means do nothing.  I will (a) take my chances resisting violent attack, and (b) stand a better chance of being unharmed than someone who does nothing.   What a joke.  Criminals want a disarmed population.  How can you keep criminals from preying on us after our best means of self defense is taken away ?"	1
" Please tell me what you think would have happened had the people  come out with their hands up several weeks ago.   More than someone who would not release children from the compound.

I am not pleased with the BATF handling of the affair.  I think they  bungled it badly from the start.  But I don't think they are  responsible for the fire, which started in two different places.

"  There are several ways in which one can choose to intrepret any  constitutational issue :     (a) Original intent    (b) Subjectively intrepreted accordiong to political whims of the day.  If we use original intent as the basis for intrepreting the constitution,  it is clear that the founding fathers intended that the individual citizen  be allowed to bear arms similar to those used by soldiers of the day.  For references, I cite :    - Federalist papers      - ""The Embarassing Second Ammendment"", Yale Law Review,      Prof. Stanford Levinson [sorry, I don't have the date handy]         Prof Levinson sought to prove that the 2nd ammendment did not        convey an individual right, but concluded that it did, hence the         ""embarassing"" in his title.     - Report of the Subcomittee on the Consititution, United States Sendate,     97th Congress, Second Session February 1982.    - U.S. vs. Verguido Urguidez (Supreme court case in recent years).

   Killed by handgun, or killed?  If I'm dead, I don't much care if it was by being shot or stabbed to death.      I don't think you can get an accurate indicator of how safe England is compared to Switzerland by concentrating only on handgun murders and   completely ignoring murders by other weapons, not to mention the rate of other violent crimes.  If there are more guns in circulation, if follows that more people will be killed with them 'cause they are available to the person intent on committing a crime _regardless_ of whether they have to do it with a gun, knife, or bare hands.    The gun control lobby doesn't seem to understand this point.  If people are intent on committing a crime, they will do it with whatever means are available to them.  	1
" Well, if police think they are so special that only _THEY_ are worthy of self-defense, perhaps we start putting the arm on police; maybe we should start demanding that police are only police when ON-DUTY, that after that they are just like the ordinary disarmed helpless chumps they consider ""civilians.""  Let's prohibit arms carrying by police when off-duty. Or, if they make the assertion that ""Well, I need to maintain my gun"" let's make it regulation that they can carry an UNLOADED firearm home, that it's only fair that they be just as helpless as poor schmuck coming home from his computer operator job...  NRA Director/ex-San Jose cop Leroy Pyle states in the latest SWAT magazine that anti-cops better watch out for this schism between RKBA folks and the police.

"/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider) /  8:51 pm  Apr 12, 1993 /   I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even contributed a few comments) but this stuff ""I'd rather face a knife than a gun"" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the same thing, then I got 'educated.'  People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick (within a minute or so) death.  The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.  Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as the attacker.  Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison.  If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the pointed end.)  Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'  This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.  The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually do this.  Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive.  I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes."	1
" Of course, if you're a criminal, or hang around with criminals, or flash large wads of cash in the wilder parts of town, or utter verbal bigotry in the right public places, your chances of being shot are much higher.  Avoiding these behaviors, on the other hand, decreases your chances of being shot.  Something like 60% of all murders are criminals killing criminals.  Over 90% of murders are committed by people with a prior *known* history of violence.  Simplistic moral, suitable for my three year old, and most inane posters:  ""Bad people do bad things - repeatedly."" "	1
I predict that the outcome of the study of what went wrong with the Federal Assault in Waco will result in future assaults of that type being conducted as full-scale military operations with explicit shoot-to-kill directives. --  Dave Feustel N9MYI <feustel@netcom.com>	1
"        Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There are verifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments abusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove.          I'd love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.           It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed to do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies total government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.          This is very likely.          The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many people would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're here.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should have always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't. Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more magical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.          No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S., two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide rates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate.         The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The fct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody, whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent.        Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.        Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.           In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms. (50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per  se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's countries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got more knives or fists.           In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S. have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they are doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is  violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The *vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of 99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.          The situation is not ""good"" in that people fear for their lives. But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots, protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they, too, lost their livelihoods?          The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't. However, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can be appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.         You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough, as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)          45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun. That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans. Firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.         You may take that for what it's worth. "	1

If they blast away a few good fokes then that is : :With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with :mega fire power.

I will NOT support the BATF until they clean up their act... Maybe...  As to equipment, the BATF has damn near anything it wants...  Their faults were in intelligence (military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting negotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms and tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the child-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco issues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with no violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then the FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence, murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the  public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault on American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue, the Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for BATF wrongdoing.  James  btw, if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability.   	1
"Just to shed some light on the fire, it was widely reported (AP, etc.) that there WERE several witnesses to BD folks starting the fires.  It has also been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once, which rules out a Bradley knocking over a lamp, etc. as the cause.  What I would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident.  I believe the moves made were right and proper, but I still have some problems with some of the tactics.  After watching the ABC special on it tonight, as well as CNN and Nightline, I question some of the ATF and FBI actions.  1) Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound at some time before the Feb. 28th raid?  2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.  3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the ""right"" course of action?  And a few other questions.  Like I said, I believe the actions taken, in general, were proper.  But I still have some reservations."	1

That the BBC banned Paul McCartney's ""Give Ireland Back to the Irish"" as well as John Lennon's ""Give Peace a Chance"" during the Gulf War.  Yes, England is very very funny.  And very pathetic.

Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one (though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.   Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?   Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.   In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though, were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just registering the shotgun?   ""Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!  Here's a slightly-used short sword, *THE* battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh century!  Only $39.95 with trade-in.  Easy financing!""  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  You guys still slicing each other with long knives, or is this really not a problem?   I'm all for that.  What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I'm only a couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing. Maybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become civilized with?   Yes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as ""Americans"" first and foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage, whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke ""low Dane,"" whereas others spoke ""high Dane.""  It was shortly after World War II, as I remember, that ""low Dane"" was abolished so there was one common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem, because we have even more obvious means of identifying an ""outsider.""

"jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:     Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not    be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be    local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill    AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.    High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but    the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun    - and would pay through the nose for it.  Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude, homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns.  Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible. The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing, hand tools and a welder.  I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I think the demand for ""real"" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have firearms, and ""bad guys"" will continue to have access to them, one way or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation."	1
" I think the point is being missed - that it is apparantly acceptable for Big Government (Big Brother?) to use TANKS to control the people, as long as they don't use the BIG GUN (but everything else is allright...).  Tanks deployed against civilians, let alone FIRING on them with crew served weaponry (a .50 Heavy Machine Gun is crew-served) is something both our press and government howl about instantly when done in some other country.  Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time LIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind the tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle or pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And ""snipers"" too often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.  I don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but the idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that pretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels it is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even violent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally out of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war on its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility, government of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other elites who want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel the need to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military boot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced that it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances redressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that will exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been unresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse to open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever. Its the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a government going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simply squash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances in other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too inconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them in the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...  And these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things so that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are than expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn't PROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...  Unbelievable.  And I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation, that it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun into a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many explosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000 pound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall, and some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources of buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as gunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much, and could be explained by ""musta been a gas leak... "".  I think it could be done and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is not like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning and firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossible to cover up.   "	1

"        Here's a question:  If most marijuana is domestic and producing it here is economical, why would we expect it to be imported?          Yet it was done.  Done quite successfully for a number of years. *Somebody* thought it was worth the risk.          Your assumption is that this ""low"" dollar/pound area is sufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable.  On what do you base this?           And given that smuggling channels are already established, and given the economies of scale, would it really add significantly more expense to start smuggling firearms, especially considering doing so would be less hazardous (in terms of getting caught) than drugs?          Now *that* was a jump.  In any case, define ""local.""  It's a big country.           Wow, you gotta love the speculation.         As I posted before, we import billions upon billions of raw ores across the Mexican border.  Not only that but ships come in and out of U.S. harbors every day full stuff.  And customs doesn't even have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.           I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be worth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteed to get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold of every ship which came through.         It's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but how much *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihood of being caught.  Less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle. "	1

"Could someone email me a USNail address for the NRA? I'd like to write them a letter encouraging them to see to it VERY EMPHATICALLY that the 2nd amendment is restored to the form that the founding fathers intended.  People like Howard Metzenbaum seem very intent on diluting the 2nd amendment to the point where it is no effort for the governmentski to do what they did in Waco.  After all, from what I know of the Federalist papers, it is this kind of tyranny the 2nd amendment was supposed to be designed to protect against.  Honestly! M-60 tanks against the civilian population! Attack helicopters!  We need the right to keep and bear anti-tank weapons. Actually, if they intend to mass armour against the (weakly-armed, at that) civilian population, we need the right to field tactical nukes. Government tyranny! Who would have ever thought it would happen here!  I wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next, because the gov. SUSPECTS child abuse. Maybe yours! Maybe mine! And what is an Illegal Weapon (which they have yet to show us), if the 2nd amendment is designed to do what I believe it is, and the gov. uses tanks against you? Government self-serving? Naaaah. Not here.  Time was when the U.S. used armour/attack helicopters against small countries. Now, we're down to using them against to what amounts to a busload and a half of civilians.

" Is the license required for driving a car exclusively on private property, such as a farm? Here in the United States, the license is required only for the use of public roads.   We also have a nation of 250 million people, _many_ issues and usually only two candidates for a given office. A President might be willing to abuse mild gun control laws and create a de-facto ban (something a majority of the people would object to) and still be elected: The voters might look at issues like the civil rights of minorities, health care, etc... and vote for the ""lesser of two evils."" I don't think this is a matter of paranoia, since local governments in (for example) New York and Chicago have abused existing, mild gun control laws to  create a virtual ban.   In which case, the United States already has adaquate gun control laws: According to federal statistic, only 7% of gun-wielding criminals legally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers. If that's the point of gun control (to prevent criminals from legally purchasing guns) then America doesn't need any additional laws to accomplish this.   How is this any different from guns? There are legal purposes for owning and using a gun: They are appropriate tools for hunting, target shooting and self-defence. Like cars, murder isn't their only (or even a common) use.   I certainly couldn't imagine the American public accepting regulation of axes. While the politics of other nations may be different, in America there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that primarily would effect the average, law-abiding citizen who had not done anything wrong.   A good way to deal with which problem? It is an excelent way to deal  with the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course, it doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. But at this point, what can these individuals do about long-term social problems?    There are, according to surveys, guns in 40% of American homes. In many parts of the country, this is closer to 100%. Those places where almost everyone owns a gun are, on average, safer than those where guns are less common.   This is, I think, a fundamental difference between American government and that of other nations. Here it is not acceptable to punish or restrict the average, law-abiding citizen in the name of some vague ""common good."" "	1

" Kratz comments above show otherwise.   Bingo - now the question is, does the Glock's qualify?  Let's see the evidence that Kratz uses.   But first an aside.  Having an air gun proves nothing.  Moreover, my comments are based on what Kratz writes.  He's free to argue that he babbles in text but actually knows something off-line.   Harder than what?  I note that almost all revolvers work the same way, so it can't be ""harder than revolvers"".   Sure they can.  (Moreover, we know now that Kratz' sample is unrepresentative.)  We can look at the reasoning.  It is basically ""these Glocks are dangerous because they're not like my 1911/S&W third generation.""  Part of that is true, but since those same people don't claim that revolvers, which share the relevant property, are dangerous, we see that the argument fails.   Why would I care?

"Dennis Deconcini, 1982   ...In these and similar areas, the Bureau has violated not only the dictates of common sense, but of 5 U.S.C. Sec 552, which was intended to prevent ""secret lawmaking"" by administrative bodies.    These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub- committee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United States.    It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.    It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search- ing and seizing private property.    It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with- out regard for their right to due process of law.    The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was utterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the Treasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities were aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille- gally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to be used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently made great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen- tation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before BATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into unknowning technical violations.

It has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which funds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly professional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government. The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in successful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use of firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It enforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an illegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in preventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known gangs from access to weapons.   The Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession (automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs and other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to trace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF is the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with state and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state and local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members of the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a Sunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would be separated from the women and children and not in the area where it was known that the illegal weapons were stored.   As you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending execution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and prepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation presented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and firepower of the Branch Davidians.   Based on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian raid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the cult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the Waco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick and peaceful conclusion.   Sincerely,   Dennis DeConcini Chairman Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government   April 7, 1993  "	1

This would be much better if it said ""everyone except those who have been striped of this right by due process of law"" or some such thing.  Also, I don't care for the Federal Government stepping on states rights regardless of which state right is being stepped on.  If the constitution doesn't give the Feds some power then they have to just shut up about it.  The only way the Feds should have anything to say is if the Constitution prohibits localities from infringing on the RKBA.  In which case this bill should just reiterate that the RKBA is guaranteed by the Constitution and that the Feds will take appropriate action if it is infringed.  "	1

 When will you people realize that our right to keep and bear isn't primarily intended to be for protecting against criminals and beasties in the wild?  Granted, it is a big part, but we also need military style weapons so we can fight off the government when they come to our door. When ten agents come to my door, it would be nice to be able to shoot all of them for 'not upholding the constitution to the best of their ability'.  It will be a lot harder doing that with the puny weapons you listed above.  Please read the Federalist papers for all clarification on RKBA.

"   Well the attorneys of the Davidians reported on Larry King that the tanks had actually damaged the structure to the extent that effectuating egress from the building was difficult at best. With a rapidly spreading fire and large amounts of smoke and tear gas, finding the right exits, or acceptible holes in the walls were nearly impossible.  I find this explanation to be completely  plausible.  Doesn't mean that it's true, but I don't find it intrinsically less believable than the government stories.    I concur.   Indeed.  According to the lawyers, the Davidian survivors say that lanterns were knocked over during the ""probing"" and that's how the fire started.  A tragic accident, if true.    See above.  This one is going to be thoroughly investigated.  Maybe we'll eventually get some idea of what happened.  My view is that, from beginning to end, this operation was a botch and that it is completely possible that nut cases who were otherwise law-abiding citizens were victims of a bureaucratic execution. --  paul hager  hagerp@moose.cs.indiana.edu"	1

" Unfortunately, elections can, and are, bought.  Promise the voters money, and they will vote for you.   Same here.  Convicted felons may not legally purchase firearms.   That you know of.  While I lived in the DBR, a gang robbed a joint US Army/Bundewehr armoury and got several hundred M-16s, ammunition, handguns and some explosives.  When I left two years later, there were no clues.   Who uses them is the problem.  Crime, in the U.S., is ""no big deal"" if you are the criminal.  How about 5 years for murder.  Credit for time served (in jail, waiting for trial) and you are out in 12 months, worst case.  If we would put criminals, especially violent ones, in the slam for true sentences, crime would drop.  Instead, we reward them for being good and let them out early, very early.   Serbs, Croats and Muslims have been killing each other almost since before the invention of guns.  Old women are throwing stones at UN trucks.  This is a hatred that goes beyond reason.  Yes, the problem is the user.  Question back (since you are one of the rational ones):  If all gun crime were to stop, would you support dropping all gun controls?   They did not believe, from experience, that the ""police"" (including National Guard) could/would protect them.  Unless you want to argue that a human being does not have a right to protect him/herself, they did the right thing.  What would you suggest as a defense against a mob throwing bottles and rocks, and also likely armed with stolen firearms?   Criminals would move to Scandinavia??? :-)  The average criminal would look for a less hazardous job, and the rest would likely be buried at county expense.   Personally, I criticize the fools who send money to the IRA to ""make Ireland free"".  Of course, this is the last thing the IRA wants, because they lose power if England pulls out.  But that's for another group.   The U.S. has roughly 20 times the major sporting events as the U.K..  How many riots did we have at sporting events last year (off the playing field)?  Hooligan is a word never used when reffering to sports fans here.  I guess that's where the different cultures thing comes in.   Yes.  The question is, is the problem one of too many guns (mostly from the army) or not enough (nonSerbians can not defend themselves.   But disarming responsible gun owners is not the solution.  Yet, that is exactly what HCI is proposing."	1
   As I recall, in the 60's the Kennedy Administration had sub-kiloton nuclear weapons withdrawn from Europe and destroyed.  They were man- portable and made for use in shoulder-mount rocket launchers.  The smallest nuclear test I've seen data for was a .1 (yes, one-tenth) kiloton weapon tested either in the late 40's or early 50's.	1

"  Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits?  There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting.   Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much  freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket).   By ""cannot now be justified"" I guess you mean that you personally don't see any justification.  Fine--but what makes your opinion so important?   Certainly the last point is correct.  If politicians don't see any votes for themselves in opposing stupid legislation or in developing and supporting measures which might be effective in reducing the  incidence of violent crime they won't do these things."	1
" re: is ""John Q. Public with a gun"" protected?     Miller was convicted of owning a sawed-off shotgun and not paying the NFA '34 tax.  Snatches of the court's decision:  The Second Amendment was intended to ""assure the continuation and render  possible the effectiveness of such a force [the militia]... It must be  interpreted and applied with that end in view.""  The militia includes ""all males physically capable of acting in concert  for the common defense.""  However, regarding sawed-off shotguns, ""certainly it is not within  judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military  equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.""  ""Judicial notice"" is the term of art here -- it meant that no such evidence had been formally presented.  This is different from claiming that they had ruled that it wasn't.   I'm not talking about plain shotguns in war -- I'm talking about short- barrelled (""sawed-off"") shotguns in war.  Compare Revolutionary War blunderbusses; luparas in the Spanish-American  War; and trench-cleaners in WW I.  They were also put to good use by US soldiers in WW II, not to mention being invaluable to ""tunnel rats""  in Vietnam, but, of course, ""Miller"" took place in 1939.   Here is my quandary:  you seem to be arguing that certain types of  guns fall outside the scope of the Second.  This isn't a useful argument  unless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs in that class.    I think we both agree that zip guns probably aren't protected.  Maybe  we also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments  have been banning or trying to ban because they have ""no sporting purpose""  and ""no provate citizen would ever need these guns"" DO fall under the  protection of the Second.    So, given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at  some time been used by the military, even if only for marksmanship  training purposes, I need to understand why you are intent on pressing  this point, arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second.   Often, what makes someone unpopular is what other people say about him. How much did any of us fear or abhor the Branch Davidians six months ago? How many of us feared or abhorred Saddam Hussein five years ago? -- "	1

 As I understand it was considered unsafe for the tv networks to get any closer. Surely the networks can judge the risks of reporting for themselves. I haven't noticed CNN being banned from Baghdad hotels yet despite the (all too real) risk of having a cruise missile land in the lobby. Incidentally has that ever been explained or are we to assume that out of the whole of the city an off-course missile just happened to hit that hotel at a probability of about 1 in some very large number?

" That's an interesting statement.  There's quite a difference between Hollywood's ""Old West"" and the real one.  Yes, there were drunks, saloons, mining camps, and thugs.  However, as McGrath showed, the thugs preyed almost exclusively on one another.  McGrath claims that this was due to the fact that no one much cared if someone who insisted on getting into a fight got his way, even if he lost, while they really did care when thugs preyed on others.   We haven't figured out that those distinctions don't actually work. Machine guns have been strictly regulated since 1934.  Said regulation is both perfect (legally owned machine guns aren't ever used criminally) and a complete waste of time (the criminal use of machine guns hasn't change at all).  The result - we're now arguing about guns that LOOK like machine guns, but are no different than other guns.  -andy"	1
"  We've heard a lot of talk about brainwashing in Waco but the brainwashing of the general population never ceases to amaze me.

NO THEY DIDN'T. They either did not have enough information to act in good faith or else they acted knowing the risk.

  There are, but not any that would help Texans: In many states, such laws have been found to violate the state constitution.  But the federal Second Amendment does not apply directly to the states. It was written to limit the federal government only.  The Fourteenth Amendment was written to extend the restrictions of the Bill of Rights to the state level. However, the exact wording of the Fourteenth Amendment is very vague. The Supreme Court has been dancing around the issue without facing it directly for over 100 years. In practice, the Bill of Right (indirectly applies through the Fourteenth) applies to the state governments only if the Supreme Court has ruled that  particular provision. The Court has made no such rulings on the Second Amendment.	1

"        Tennessee, at least, does not require any sort of safety class to get a driver's license.  All that is required is one twenty question quiz and to drive a car around the block without crashing.         In all probability, no you don't.  You are required to be licensed to drive on public roads.  A license is not necessary on private property.          Most states do not require the registration of cars that are not used on public roads.  Those that do (California I know of) do so for tax purposes more than anything else.              Many states do not currently require this, and most, again, only make this requirement for public roads.  A car sitting unused  is not required to have insurance.          The two are not the same, as I pointed out above.  There are significant difference between making rules for *use on public property* and *making rules for ownership*.         The other half of the objection is trust.  Similar things to this have been tried in many local jurisdications across the country, and have been abused in far too many cases.   Safety classes which are never sheduled, never funded, or only one or two is held a year for a limited number of participants.  Registration lists in New York, Chicago, and California have been used for confiscation.  *Many* gun owners would, in theory, support these planes.

In the USA, that is a weapon of mass destruction, biological in nature, because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water.

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard Scanjet IIp was purchased this week.  Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:  John Sorenson Carol Sigelman Carla Moore Barbara Moose Judith Schrier  Again, thank you to all who gave!  I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to  review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.   It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett  Packard Scanners.    When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options;  (1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3)  automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image.   I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which  parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.  Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The  software gives you two ""errors"" at this point.  Blue which are words that were  converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.   Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted  correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more  credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue,  you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal  dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited,  considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary.   After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word  processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a  seperate TIFF or PCX file format.  I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.   While most of my faxes were received in ""standard"" mode (200x100 dpi), the  accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent.   Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the  limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just  too small.   If anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has  been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g.,  Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus,  Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences  of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera,  malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore,  control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug  resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease,  salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging  infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those  in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and  minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of  emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more  effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs  (3).       This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, ""Emerging Infectious  Diseases."" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as  surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and  public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation  of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4).   References  1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that  identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from  one restaurant chain. Washington       On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of  Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an  increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a  case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or  postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls  implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset  (matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January  18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants  was initiated.       As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January- February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the  state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case  definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS  (Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with  confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of  symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A  restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients  who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating  a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17  through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30  developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years  (range: 0-74 years). Idaho       Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health,  Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture- confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December  11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were  hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13  (93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California       In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was  notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died.  Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with  E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993.  Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was  reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27%  increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January  1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as  postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured,  or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.       Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The  outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen  persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median  age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of  the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community  controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched  OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients  who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular- sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).  Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada       On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten  at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District  issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea  contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody  diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness  with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local  laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools  for E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After  SMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of  one patient 38 days after illness onset.       Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine  were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range:  0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex- matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during  the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence  limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients  also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7- 49.8). Other Investigation Findings       During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases  primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November  19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in ""jumbo"" patties produced on  November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11  lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed  to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672  (20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.       A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the  United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing  the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter  plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one  slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.       Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in  families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first  identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody  diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since  emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common  cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked  most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other  food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been  implicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter  study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7  that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10  participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a  higher rate than for any other pathogen.       Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most  clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses  associated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea  (often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups  and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and  complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients  develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,  renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.       This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community  outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite  the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in  three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington  (1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from  persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5).  When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported  to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public  health action to prevent further cases.       E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can  contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S.  Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify  critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce  the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply.  Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with  pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens  from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be  internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook  ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices  are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played  an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim  recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to  155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).       Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report  and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be  consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of  outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of  this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections  caused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E.  coli O157:H7.

Long-term use of  smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of  oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who  currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1).  To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products,  CDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease  Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing  tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian,  noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This  report summarizes findings from this survey.       The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked ""Have you used snuff at least 20  times in your entire life?"" and ""Do you use snuff now?"" Similar questions were  asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of  smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco  use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the  time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having  used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the  time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and  former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at  least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as  those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not  smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on  smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or  equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide  national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using  standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN)  (3).       In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users  of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%)  women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco  use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was  highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was  highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan  Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American  Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was  substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in  rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only  for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).       Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those  aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of  chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although  women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest  among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.       An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being  former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were  former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons  aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users  (56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95%  CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users  was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5%  95% CI=68.9-78.1).       Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0)  currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95%  CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95%  CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.       Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3%  95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6- 49.6).   Reported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease  Prevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National  Center for Health Statistics, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless  tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in  particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that  link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral  snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this  behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for  nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4).       Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among  racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels  and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require  further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role  in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the  differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6).       In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current  smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the  prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco  users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous  study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked  reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to  stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health  implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.       The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special  population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless  tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year  2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more  than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the  prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless  tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts,  enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes  commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to  routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based  prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit  tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

The only good thing about nystatin is that it's (relatively) cheap and when taken orally, non-toxic.  But oral nystatin is without any systemic effect, so unless it were given IV, it would be without any effect on your sinuses.  I wish these quacks would first use IV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you.  That would solve the ""yeast"" problem once and for all.

rousseaua@immunex.com writes about heat shock proteins (HSP's) and DNA.  I hate to be derogatory, but in this case I think it's warranted.  HSP's are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY protein- because it's DEAD!    Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be  completely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2.    Some of you worry WAY too much.  Eat a healthy, balanced diet and relax.  My advice is, if you don't know what you are talking about, it is better to keep your mouth shut than to open it and remove all doubt about your ignorance.

"Does the Bates method work?  I first heard about it in this newsgroup  several years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, ""How to improve your sight - simple daily drills in relaxation"", by Margaret D. Corbett,  ('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It  talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by  actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing  the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the  too-long eyeball?  Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process, i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by  changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of  eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the  eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's  idea, right?)"	0

=Surprise surprise, different people react differently to different things. One =slightly off the subject case in point. My brother got stung by a bee. I know =he is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localized =swelling, not anaphylactic shock. I could not convince the doctors of that, =however, because that's not written in their little rule book.  Of course, bee venom isn't a single chemical.  Could be your brother is reacting to a different component than the one that causes anaphylactic shock in other people.  Similarly, Chinese food isn't just MSG.  There are a lot of other ingredients in it.  Why, when someone eats something with lots of ingredients they don't normally consume, one of which happens to be MSG, do they immediately conclude that any negative reaction is to the MSG?  =I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad =reactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting.

I love the FAQ.         The comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining correction after RK and possibly after PRK is interresting.  Why is this?  Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well?  Also, why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of only about 5% of the corneal depth, while RK is done to a depth of up to 95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilar with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must not be understanding all of the differences.  In the FAQ, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than with glasses alone.  If this is completly attributable to the intentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for when necessary with glasses (or contacts, if they CAN be worn afterall!).  It is important to know if that is not the case, however, and some other consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision.  The first thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense, which glasses couldn't help.   would not help. 	0

 Elevated levels of Glu and Asp in the blood are able to bypass the Blood-brain barrier through the circumventricular organs (or CVO), in particular the adeno and neurohypophysis (pituitary gland) areas.  The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the median eminence regions are particularly effected.  CVO areas are not subject to the blood-brain barrier. These areas control the release of gonadotropin, which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development, especially sexual development. Changes in adult rats, which are less sensitive to Glu than humans, have been observed: after ingesting Glu, on a chronic basis, cycles of several steroids are disrupted. Blood levels of somatostatin are significantly reduced, and cyclic release of steroids becomes flattened.	0

MSG is common in many food we eat, including Chinese (though some oriental restaurants might put a tad too much in them).  I've noticed that when I go out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants, I will usually get a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards.  This happens to many of my friends and relatives too.  And, heh, we eat Chinese food all the time at home :) (but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves)  So, when we put one and one together, it can be safely assumed that MSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people.  Stick with natural things.  MSG doesn't do body any good (and possibly harms, for that matter).  So, why bother with it?  Taste food as it should be tasted, and don't cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of MSG.  -michael 	0

My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.    Speaking as a physician who works in an urgent care center, the above behavior is completely inappropriate. If a patient who requires extensive care shows up at the last minute, we always see them and give them appropriate care. It is reasonable for a clinic to refuse to see patients outside of its posted hours, but what you describe is misbehavior. Ask to speak to the clinic director, and complain. Whatever their attitude, they have nothing to gain from angering patients."	0
" Hi Janet,  Sounds exactly like mine.  Same circumstance, same onset symptoms,  same cafergot uselessness, same duration.  In fact, of all the people I know who have migraines, none have been so similar.  There is such a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their headaches, that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learned about mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.  I don't think it's heat, per se (I've had more in winter than summer). Dehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up before playing rather than after.  Being in shape doesn't seem to help me much, either.  I've identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in  descending order of importance):  1) Heavy exercise 2) Sleep deprivation 3) Fasting  (e.g., skipped breakfast) 4) Physical trauma (e.g., head bonk)  Heavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but I  don't get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of  the other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discovered  this, I've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two  or three years when I get cocky (""It's been so long, maybe I just don't  get them anymore"") and stop being careful.  Hope this is helpful."	0

" Probably because most of them come packaged with some absurd theory behind them.  E.G. homoeopathy: like cures like.  The more you dilute things, the more powerful they get, even if you dilute them so much there is no ingredient but water left.  Chiropractic: all illness stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Such systems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidental and not related to the theory.  The only exception is probably herbalism, because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants that have active and useful substances.  But that isn't what  is meant by alternative medicine, usually.  If you get into the Qi, accupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories that probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases.  Perhaps another reason they are reluctant is the Rhine experience.

"[reply to aldridge@netcom.com (Jacquelin Aldridge)]     The acquisition of scientific knowledge is completely scientific.  The application of that knowledge in individual cases may be more art than science.     Certainly we don't have all the answers.  The question is, what is the most reliable means of acquiring further medical knowledge?  The scientific method has proven itself to be reliable.  The *only* reason alternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that their practitioners refuse to submit their theories to rigorous scientific scrutiny, insisting that ""tradition"" or anecdotal evidence are sufficient.  These have been shown many times in the past to be very unreliable ways of acquiring reliable knowledge.  Crook's ideas have never been backed up by scientific evidence.

 Endometriosis is where cells that would normally be lining the uteris exist outside the uteris.  Sometimes this causes problems, often it doesn't.

" No, there is something called the ""Delany Amendment"" which makes carcinogenic food additives illegal in any amount.  This was passed by Congress in the 1950's, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increased detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude.  This is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the Act they are banned.  This also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember a time back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good, and never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned. This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves.  If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someone would do it, in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicates that enforcement is still in effect."	0
I don't mean to be disrespectful to your concerns, but it seems to me  that you're getting all wound up in a non-issue.    As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally  occurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.  When food  manufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because it's a  known flavor enhancer.   Your wife's theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite,  may well be true.  But I don't believe it's ALWAYS the reason it's  added.  People are (largely, for the most part) in charge of their  own appetites.   You don't know much about cats, do you?   Cats will Take Advantage of You.  Resign yourself:  you will never   understand a cat.  Their tastes are whimsical.    I also suspect, though it's been a while since I've checked ingredients  on commercial cat food, that there are much more stringent requirements  on pet food additives than human.    See, the FDA has this stupid idea that human beings have the intelligence  to look out after their own interests.  	0

But what is the difference between Einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or Korzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose your own.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong. Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this.    Let me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many kinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of criticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either not important or not interesting.  The first difference is the one that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the one that Lee Lady seems to be discussing.    I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered  scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims, not just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work; what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the presence of qi.   Certainly a ""theoretical structure that makes sense"" is the goal. In areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let's face it: we cannot always wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything clear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. "	0
    It's worse than that -- there *is* no such thing as    a double-blind study on the effects of MSG, by    virtue of the fact that MSG changes the taste of food in    a characteristic way that is detectable by the subject and    that cannot be duplicated by a placebo.  Common! You can easily disguise  to flavor of  MSG by putting  it in a capsule. Then,  the  study  becomes  a  double  blind of  MSG capsules against control  capsules (containing exactly  the same contents minus the MSG). --	0

Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive _Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by either obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when not entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted).    OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.    Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having  recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.   The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather than being from an external source.  Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing, or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety.  In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships.  Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions.  The standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the DSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .        kind regards,	0
Ihave had a frozen shoulder for over a year or about a year.  It is still partially frozen, and I am still in physical therapy every week.  But the pain has subsided almost completely.  UNTIL last week when I mowed the lawn for twenty minutes each, two days in a row.  I have a push type power mower.  The pain started back up a little bit for the first time in quite a while, and I used ice and medicine again.  Can anybody explain why this particular activity, which does not seem to stress me very much generally, should cause this shoulder problem?  Thanks.	0

"GREAT post Martin.  Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian without neglecting the need for scientific rigor.   (Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing will be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med since most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the replies, if any, will be med-related.)     They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS). Oops, that is not a recognized ""illness"" in the psychological community, better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)  Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system, just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general population, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage - any help here a.p.p.er's?)  One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are also extroverted, they are best described as ""Field Marshalls"".  This trait is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge, to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically- minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However, when the NT person has self-image challenges, the ""dark-side"" of this personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.  A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling), and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).  Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)  Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.    You've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent.    In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged. I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal therapy below).   The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween infection.    I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal, he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin) supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene. Call me carrot face.  :^)  Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.    Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that demonstrate candida ""blooms"" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal).  BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious) aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion.    My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive. Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a  threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post, one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a  Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.  BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, ""Sinus Survival"", has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.  This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit, lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.    This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture the yeast ""bloom"" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.  It's a real Catch-22.  Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets, you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.  It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue -  excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...    Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia?    Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus species can grow hyphae (""roots"") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long- term treatment of GI tract ""candidiasis"".  It's like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away.  The $60000 question is whether a contained candida ""bloom"" can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming ""systemic"" in the classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal.    Also, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior post, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)    As I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work. For example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated. Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to ""live with it"".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total ""cure"".  The anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above. Be sure to get the revised edition.)    Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said ""you'll just have to live with it"".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- ""yeast hypothesis"" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as, ""it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases"", to put it mildly. I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient.  Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the ""hypothetical yeast overgrowth"" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things - you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice? Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with ""scientific correctness"" that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment, and as a result I have found significant relief.  Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me: ""well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State Board.""  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine, and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all (true quackery).  I better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.    What dosage of B6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper working of the mucos memebranes?    I'd like to see the role of complex carbohydrates, such as starch.    Brave soul you are.  The venom on Usenet can be quite toxic unless one develops an immunity to it.  One year ago, my phlegmatic self would have backed down right away from an attack of cholericitis.  But my immune system, and my computer system, have been hardened from gradual desensitization.  I now kind of like being called ""anal retentive"" - it has a nice ring to it.  I also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the post - truly classic, worthy of a blue (or maybe brown) ribbon.  I might even cross-post it to alt.best.of.internet.  Hmmm...    Thanks again for a great and informative post.  I hope others who have researched this area and are lurking in the background will post their thoughts as well, no matter their views on this subject.

  Maybe, maybe not.  A new graduate would obviously be well trained (but perhaps without sufficient experience). A radiologist trained 10 or 15 years ago who has not kept his continuing education current is a  whole 'nuther matter.

If you have questions, you want to send mail to Richard, not me.  -- Dan           Software Tools to help with RSI       -------------------------------   This file describes tools, primarily software, to help prevent or manage RSI. This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches...   Please let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have information or opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ.  I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them.

TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use, by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to   warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.  Often, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening. These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your  body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.        Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)     Available from:  Bright Star  Tel: +1 (206) 451 3697     Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows     Description:  Provides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info.   Warns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations  on posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best   with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible  to record your own messages to warn of break.

El Camino Real  Suite 109  Mailstop 403  Sunnyvale, CA  Tel: +1 (408) 730 8410     Platforms: DOS     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or  after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.  It gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from  a set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work  you do - data entry, word processing, information processing.  Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on  how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.   CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use   to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information  on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.  A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.   CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then  warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear  useful when used with Windows.   Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.      Comments:  The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better  to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to  measure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff  is very good and includes some summaries of research papers,  as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company   to pay up for RSI management tools.

Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts  for resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).       Comments:  I have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say  it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it  does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it  interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which  is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on  Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure  why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has  one window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not  require any sound hardware.      Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)     Available from:  Visionary Software  P.O.

It is also the only  tool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it  on your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!  Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does   have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,  which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.      Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)     Available from:  Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar     Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)     Description:  This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you  to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously  typing.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check  that you really do take a break, and tells you when you  can start typing again.     Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing  today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you  know how much you *really* type.  It also logs information  to a file that you can analyse or simply print out.     The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),  in a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message  (for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu>   has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for   X, Zephyr and Mach.   Not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  (for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,  X Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give   feedback.      Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs     Available from:  Various sources     Platforms: Various     Description:  Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming  appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.  Or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit  a program to run at a specific time to display a message to  the screen.   Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and  include this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so  you get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you  want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.  Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter  9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break  is for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat   for the next appointment.   By using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes  that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this  file on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with  a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments  with RSI exercises.   The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs.   An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job  that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will  depend a lot on your operating system.   While these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing   yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI   management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to  write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating  system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.      Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers     Available from:  Various sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.     Description:  Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable  number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either  manually or automatically.     While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you  are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from  a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great  advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you  are doing.       Comments:  My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to  my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which  actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left  arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been  very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.   I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but  these are not much good because they do not give an audible  warning of the end of the time period!   KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.   One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how  you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing, and may therefore make matters worse.      Tool: hsh (public domain)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar     Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)     Description:  Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.  Only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or  an xterm, but not most X programs).      Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c  Also built into Windows 3.x.      Description:  The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout  that involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent  RSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since   it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)   "	0
"    From THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY GUIDE TO TOTAL NUTRITION: Stanley Gershoff,     Ph.D., Dean of Tufts University School of Nutrition; HarperPerennial, 1991    (ISBN #0-06-272007-4):   ""The greatest hazard of barbecuing is that the cook will not use   enough caution and get burned.  Some people suggest that the   barbecuing itself is dangerous, because the smoke, which is    absorbed by the meat, contains benzopyrene, which, in its pure form,   has been known to cause cancer in laboratory animals.  However,   in order to experience the same results, people would have to   consume unrealistically large quantities of barbecued meat at a   time."" "	0
A very simple question : it seems to me that the contraceptive pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to fall every month. But it does not prevent the fertilzation of the  ovule. Is it true ? If yes, is there a risk of extra-uterine pregnancy, that is the development of the ovule inside the Fallopian tube ?	0
 The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without doing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something that's been known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still rather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concerned about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, and even a small increase in risk is significant there. 	0

 I've had PRK.  I would suggest asking a doctor about contacts. Mine said yes to contacts. I think the scars from RK would preclude contacts.   No. RK makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea, up to 8 I think, and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress chages. PRK vaporizes (burns) away a thin layer from the front of the cornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter. The laser doesn't cut in PRK, it vaporizes. In RK, the eye is cut into.   I find my vision is more clear for some things, and less clear for others, only at night. I notice a definite haloing at night in the darkness when I look at automobile headlamps, though this is not something I spend inordinate amounts of time doing. For ordinary things, my vision, in particular having a fully-operating peripheral vision, is clearer than with glasses, or contacts. 	0
INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language courses this summer.  Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.   FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

  Okay Mr. Dyer, we're properly impressed with your philosophical skills and ability to insult people. You're a wonderful speaker and an adept politician. However, I believe that all you were asked to do, was simply provide scientific research refuting the work of Olney. I don't think the original poster sought to start a philisophical debate. she wanted some information. Given a little effort one could justify that shooting oneself with a .45 before breakfast is a healthy practice. But we're not particularily interested in what you can verbally prove/disprove or rationalize. Where's the research? Where are the studies?  I appoligize if this sounds flamish. I simply would like to see the thread get back on track.    Lone Wolf	0
  Two thoughts.   - I think that psychologically it will be easier for the next  generation to accept genetic manipulation.  It seems that people frown upon 'messing with Nature', ignoring our eons-old practice of doing just that. Any new human intervention is 'arrogance and hubris' and manipulation we routinely do is 'natural' and certainly 'not a big deal'.   - Most interesting human traits will probably be massively polygenetic and be full of trade-offs.  In addition, without a positive social environment for the cultivation of genetic gifts, having them won't be the advantage it's made out to be.  Some people will certainly pursue it as if it is the Grail, but we know how most of those quests turn out.	0

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically     reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.   For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical     Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from  chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second  6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the     women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection  were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.      The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.   It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The    researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some     brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus          thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used   in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a          protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to   try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists      acidophilus in its contents.                                             --- end ---                                                ===================================  InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92   THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED   ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS   MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

In some circumstances, though, the     organisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,     intestines, vagina, or skin. When the mouth or vagina are infected, the  disease is commonly called thrush.                                         Vaginitis caused by Candida often afflicts women on birth control      pills or antibiotics. There is itching and a white, cheesy discharge.    Among narcotic addicts, Candida infections can lead to heart valve       inflammation.                                                              Diagnosis of Candida infections is confirmed by cultures and blood     tests. Treatment can be with amphotericin B or orally with ketoconazole. There is no evidence that Candida in the intestine of normal individuals leads to disease. All people at one time or another have Candida in      their intestines. Claims for any benefit from special diets or chronic   antifungal agents is not based on any solid evidence.                    --- end ---    ========================== I hope this is informative.

 As I understood it, MSG *is* natural.  Isn't it found in  tomatoes?  Anyway, lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural things; peanuts, onions, tomatoes, milk, etc.  Just because something is 'natural' doesn't mean it won't cause problems with some folks.  As for how foods taste:  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like the taste of it, why shouldn't I use it?  Saying I shouldn't use it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor has an ulcer.  People have long modified the taste of food by additives, whether they be chiles, black pepper, salt, cream sauces, etc.  All of these things cloud the flavor of the food.  Why do we bother with them? How should food be tasted?  Isn't it better left to the diner?	0
A friend of mine has a trouble with her ears ringing.  The ringing is so loud that she has great difficulty sleeping at night.  She says that she hasn't  had a normal night's sleep in about 6 months (she looks like it too :-(). This is making her depressed so her doctor has put her on anti-depressants.  The ringing started rather suddenly about 6 months ago.  She is quickly losing sleep, social life and sanity over this.  Does anyone know of any treatments for this?  Any experience?  Coping mechanisms?  Any opinions on the anti-depressant drugs?	0
[reply to geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks)]       I made a decision a while back that I will not be bullied into getting studies like a CT or MRI when I don't think they are indicated.

" But it is quite a leap in logic to observe one situation where anecdotal evidence led nowhere and therefore conclude that anecdotal evidence will NEVER lead anywhere.  I'm sure somebody here can provide an example where anecdotal evidence (and the interpretation of it) was upheld/verified by follow-on rigorous clinical trials.    Good point.  There has been a tendency by some on this newsgroup to ""circle the wagons"" to the viewpoint that anecdotal medical evidence is worthless (maybe to counter the claims of those who are presenting anecdotal evidence to support controversial subjects, such as the ""yeast hypothesis"").  But evidence is evidence - it requires a ""jury"" or a process to sort it out and determine the truth from the junk.  Medicine must continue to strive to better understand the workings of the body/mind for the purpose of alleviating illness - anecdotal evidence is just one piece of the puzzle;  it is not worthless.  Rather, it can help focus limited resources in the right direction.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club."	0

Anthony Fauci, director of the  U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said,  ""We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly  can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will  get around microbial resistance.""  He said any delay would signify questions  over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co- authored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the   argument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery  indicates that ""$1 billion spent on vaccine trials"" has been ""a waste of time  and money"" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were  infected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of  Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument  for  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.  AIDS activists  welcomed the  new information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand  the significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.  ""We've known about this  for five years, but we're  glad it is now in the public domain,"" said Jesse  Dobson of the  California-based Project Inform.  But Peter Duesberg, who   believes that AIDS is independent of HIV and is a result of drug  abuse in the  West, said, ""We are several paradoxes away from an  explanation of AIDS--even  if these papers are right.""       ======================================================================                                    April 14, 1993      ======================================================================     ""Risk of AIDS Virus From Doctors Found to Be Minimal"" Washington Post  (04/14/93), P. A9        The risk of HIV being transmitted from infected health-care   professionals to patients is minimal, according to new research  published in  today's Journal of the American Medical Association  (JAMA).  This finding  supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of  contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the  JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive  surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies  were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and  Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and  tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found  that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an   HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.  In Maryland, 413 of 1,131  patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at  Johns Hopkins Hospital  were found to be HIV-negative.

The Florida researchers, led by  Gordon  M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine, said,  ""This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal  precautions are strictly observed.""

The OAM is a small division of  the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10  billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available  research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be  available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for  Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid  to become involved in AIDS.  ""They have to look successful and there is no  easy answer in AIDS,"" she said.    There is also a common perception that the  OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening,  such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an  advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS  community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists'  general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic  will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, ""The OAM advisory  panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It   will take them several years to accept the nature of research.""    Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator  at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, ""Here is a  wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the  Office time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much  more [than  public relations].""  ======================================================================    ""Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers"" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143,  No. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.)        Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus- 6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack  causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in  the immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a  factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research   found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte,  which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural  killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's   research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural  killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony  L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube  findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the  body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor   molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface  receptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that  herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.       ======================================================================                                    April 15, 1993       ====================================================================     ""AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor"" Journal of the  American Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert,  George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)        All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only  ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health  problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert  and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana,  Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,   respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care  about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for  the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should  be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it  is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many   respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic  development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.   Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have  on many developing countries, and the increased need for international  assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political  aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there  is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach  to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in  particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book ""Earth in the  Balance"" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable  international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child  survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the  developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically   change the future of worldwide health.  ====================================================================    ""AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply"" Journal of the American   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)        Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible  before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less  attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller  Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and  Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as  malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited   economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention  than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is  receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most  developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic  diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another  year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS  and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden  but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a  rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each  individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley  says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and   economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he  concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the  United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries  with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic   has been the rule.

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90  children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV- infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease.   HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as ""a  hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected  children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.""   Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial ""is  the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay  disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.""  If these  vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their  therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in  the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health  Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide.   The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which  funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial  at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the  ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development.   Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows  that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers  know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease.   The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined  closely for other reasons as well.  ""This trial will provide the first insight  into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,"" said  Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  ""We need this  information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent  HIV infection in children.""   In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city  areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic.   Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during  pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than  a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing  numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection  drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding  increase in the numbers of infected children.   HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.   The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV  develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These  infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of  childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms  leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays.   At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger  to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older  participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no  symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen  liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study.   Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical  School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of  Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical  officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS.   ""We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children  for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or  fevers, for example, than another,"" said Dr. McNamara.  ""We'll also look at  whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other  significant laboratory or clinical effects.""   He emphasized that the small  study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  products.   The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from  recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically  engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults.   One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a  protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.   Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is  the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug  Administration.   Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco  and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in  Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus  adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine  contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in  other Phase I vaccine trials in adults.   A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15  children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the  experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone,  considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will  be told what they receive.   If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the  experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will  begin.   Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six  months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling  skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the  HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals'  immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV  itself caused the skin disease.   Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease  without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the  National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues  described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human  Retroviruses.   Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most  animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this  problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for  HIV as well as their own genetic material.   NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse  eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters  contained both normal and transgenic animals.   Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV  genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon  after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an  incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer.   Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their  necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin  lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No  skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates.   Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a  type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can  cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the  animals.   Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the  presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were ""turned  on,"" or active, said Dr. Kopp.   The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the  mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common  infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune  systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the  skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said.   Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists  exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV  genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.   Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the  genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No  lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light.   The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter  Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases.   Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs.  Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR;  Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney,  formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

Shalala today announced the first nationwide  clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care  professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV  infection or AIDS.       The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a  physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on  drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is  funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of  San Francisco General Hospital.       Secretary Shalala said, ""One goal of this project is to share expertise  so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health  care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces  treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and  community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients  with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.""       Secretary Shalala said, ""This clinical expertise should be especially  helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in  communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.""       The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and  it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST)  Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer  questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and  health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be  answered as quickly as possible.       Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question  related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment  information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral,  literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health  care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate  sources of information or materials.       When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken  by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse  practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and  inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant  asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current  medications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history.       This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern  California.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health  Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and  by the American Academy of Family Physicians.       ""When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of  care they are able to provide to their patients,"" said HRSA Administrator  Robert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  ""This project will be a great resource for  health care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.""       ""This service has opened a new means of communication between health care  professionals and experts on HIV care management,"" said HRSA's associate  administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources  Development, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  ""Providers who treat people with  HIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment  methods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS.""

 Surprise surprise, different people react differently to different things. One slightly off the subject case in point. My brother got stung by a bee. I know he is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localized swelling, not anaphylactic shock. I could not convince the doctors of that, however, because that's not written in their little rule book.  I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad reactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting. Not that the stuff is BAD or POISON and needs to be banned, but people need to be aware that it can have a bad effect on SOME people.  Lone Wolf	0
"  The funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to MSG vary so greatly. Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some claim their heart ""skipped"" beats once in a while. Some reacted with headache, some stomach ache. Some had watery eyes or running nose, some had itchy skin or rashes. More serious accusations include respiration  difficulty and brain damage.   Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food poisoning. But if you heard things about MSG, you may think it must be it."	0

[reply to Daniel.Prince@f129.n102.z1.calcom.socal.com (Daniel Prince]     Yes.     It seems to work equally well for CFS, another hint that these may be different facets of the same underlying process.     Yes.  The benefit is usually evident within a few days of starting it. Most of the patients for whom it has worked well continued low-dose amitriptyline, daily aerobic excersise, and a regular sleep schedule (current standard therapy).  Because of the cost (usually > $150/mo., depending on dose) and potential for significant side effects like corneal injury and birth defects, I currently reserve it for those who fail conventional treatment.  It is important that the person prescribing it have some experience with it and follow the patient closely.     As far as I know, I am the only person looking at it currently.

 If she is having problems with fresh vegetables, the guess is that there is some obstruction of the intestine.  Without knowing more it is not possible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring, or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  In general, there are no dietary limitations in patients with Crohn's except as they relate to obstruction.  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on  recurrence of Crohn's.  It is important to distinguish recurrence from recurrent symptoms.  A physician would think of new inflammation as  recurrence, while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the intestine.

A friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to post the following information.  A few weeks ago, she noticed that some of her hair was starting to fall out.  She would touch her head and strands of hair would just fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old).   It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the size of a half dollar.  Since that time, she  has gotten two more bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she's described include:  several months of an irregular menstrual cycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been extremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake up one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day it's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5 very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.  She went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected thyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everything came back normal.    She's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she should see an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea?  ** By the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recently taken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn't recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm,  coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall out.	0

" No one else seems to know, so I'll post this.  This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion flap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice. They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman constant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter, and you get sick and die.  I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this book, I would imagine you would have to:  1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy    water.  2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other    molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.  During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy.  You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here.  Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.  The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids would literally be ""heavy"".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?

"A bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin was discovered.  It had produced a dull pain in that area.  The hernia was repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and a ""plug and patch"".  The doctor considered the procedure a success.  A few months later the same pain returned.  The doctor said that he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair.  Now the pain occurs more often.  My GP couldn't identify any specific problem.

"As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous question ""WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?"" I must assume that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.  She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she  believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.   (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the  food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit forming) ?  This brings up a side question of mine.

"  I think we agree on much.  However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of ""progress"" and ""rationality"" in science.  Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past, I won't go into them again now.  What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps even the ""correct"") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes ""forward"" (and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the ""critical function"" of science.  (Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true of the application of any ""critical function"" concerning replication. This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an ""anything goes"" view.)  True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is *not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science."	0
For several years I have been dealing with reccurring corneal  erosion.    There does  not  seem  to be much known about the cause of such a problem.  My current episode is pretty bad since it is located in the middle of the cornea.  If  it's bad  enough, the usual treatment for it is puncture therapy.  However, my doctor this time is trying to let it heal by  itself  by  putting  a  contact  lens  to protect the area.

 In order to excitotoxin effects of MSG, MSG that in blood must go through  blood-brain barrier that I am not sure MSG can go through or not. In normal condition, the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about  2 uM that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptor-the NMDA receptor. But the question is Neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into Neuron or glial. So no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons. 	0
"  For a brief, but pretty detailed account, try Hempel's _Philosophy of Natural Science_.   This smacks a bit of ideology -- the supposition being that Toricelli's subsequent descriptions of his reasoning are not veridical.  It gets dangerously close to an unfalsifiable view of the history and methodology of science if we deny that no subsequent reports of experimenters are reliable descriptions of their ""real"" reasons.   But my point is that this type of case is *not* a rarity.  In fact, I was going to point to Pasteur as yet another rather common example -- particularly the studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation.  I will readily concede that ""ridiculous reasons"" can play an important role in how scientists spend their time.  But one should not confuse motivation with methodology nor suppose that ridiculous reasons provide the impetus in the majority of cases based on relatively infrequent anecdotal evidence."	0
" Sometimes I have a problem with doctor's prescribing medicine like this.

Usually they are, but you get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what I've read about it... not just from my own personal experience.    Millions have it, according to my physician.  You just learn to cope with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually becomes unconscious.  The doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine) and stress, but I haven't changed my lifestyle much, and it just comes and goes (it is always there somewhat, but now I rarely notice it when it really ""kicks in"").  Also, it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss, either caused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, and passed.  In fact, my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as good of care of my hearing as I should.  Her reaction is normal.

"KS> From: keith@actrix.gen.nz (Keith Stewart) KS>My wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome KS>This apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg KS>chest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information  I'm not sure that this condition is ""recognised"" anywhere (in the sense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries between it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic features, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.  Post-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease by clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities are mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of ongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of declining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks. Musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless contributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows muscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old denervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit action potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation (fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation with reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active denervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme staining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.  Post-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically evident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio, the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one year to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio before who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among polio survivors than among people who never had polio.  The cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little evidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or destructive immunologic response to virus antigen.  There is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have anything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells, motor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration. Both groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason for these ""acute"" changes in a ""chronic"" disease (old polio) is unknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge numbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several years.  There are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny deterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe polio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain. They also tend to score higher on depression scales of neuropsychologic tests.  My take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery from severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or degenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing pain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads to progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS patient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe that PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than non-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but without PPS complaints)."	0

" Rutin is a bioflavonoid, compounds found (among other places) in the rinds of citrus fruits.  These have been popular, especially in Europe, to treat ""capillary fragility"", and seemingly in even more extreme cases-- a few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he'd had hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously, I asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active ingredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical sputtering.  I have no idea how he's doing hemorrhoid-wise these days. The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.

Low blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlying heart disease to develop arrhythmias.

"Hi  I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3 86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say ""Buy the memory from us"" or something like that.)   The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256. Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I asked them why, and all I got was ""Your point is well taken, but Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects.""   So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken.   If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are ""less busy"".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805 product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?), although evenn that might be a misprint.   Please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out there, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL."	0

 I have been able to successfully use both 16 and 24 bit color modes on my Gateway system, although my setup is less complicated than yours.  It sounds as if you may have a hardware conflict or problem.  Is your memory aperture above 16M?  I have heard rumors of incompatibilities with that SCSI card with a variety of systems.  Call up Gateway and give them hell until they help you fix it.  Dan 	0

 Not completly true.  For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 is reserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel port in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an interrupt.  On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1, a Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight with a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problem was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon as we disabled COM3, our problems went away.  Grumble ... after several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work.	0
"The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI: SCSI-I: 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}, synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer  base. SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides  SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers. SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit},  and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.  The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses TEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put}  From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out as for ""20% faster then IDE"" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2  contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1 and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip.  The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2  controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device {As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the ""20% faster then IDE"" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 controller chip. SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips {becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips {or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware (port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes."	0

 I think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system.  Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX, I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5, that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.  And you know what, when I go to CLK/2(17MHz BUS), my HD refuse to boot.    Just my 2 cent.	0

     You might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one may be comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware).  I say this because the conversion seems more geared toward a PC user wanting to use that monitor, than an Atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they want to really go wild - converting the monitor to VGA, then using it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon :-)     As for graphics cards, assuming that the Atari monitor can be modified/adapted to handle VGA signals, you should probably be able to use any VGA card (at least with a res around 640x400).

"Hi there.  We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI Ultra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit modes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup, and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally unintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire about this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it was version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I'm simply amazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).  One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none of the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers for Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've been running a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have ""Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer.""

     One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was the Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed several monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the Nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.  Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading reviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product testing was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the ranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you don't also understand the scoring.	0

"I'm trying to transfer some software between two machines   and I'm having real trouble.  My own Intel 14.4k (  v32/v32bis/v42/v42bis) works fine--I just talk to it  at 56k and everything comes out clear.  This other modem,  at the other machine, is a ""Turbomodem+"" from ""The   Complete PC"" (the machines are in seperate houses,   so a direct serial link is impossible, and copying this  much data to disk is a pain--easier to turn the machines  on for a few hours and go see a movie--no, this is not  pirated software).

I don't have a comm program that can  do precisely 14.4k.     I looked at the manual but it was unclear.  All I know is,  I didn't have this trouble with the Intel--it came  ready to connect this way.  Do I need to initialize it  any way in particular?

one way to get the system going with one floppy drive and one hard disk on a 63 watt power supply is to first disconnect the power from the floppy drive than turn on the pc, you will notice the hard drive having a real difficult time getting up to speed, but it manages. when booting is finished, plug in your floppy drive, now it will work.

 Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus. (ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow) Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when compared to IDE?   I get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed.   IDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that's how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platforms.  Is there any argument that  IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because of a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?   If data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives  at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?   A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245 million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?   So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type, considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.   But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you get more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI choice really give them more performance than IDE?   True, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.   No argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the best reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer eventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single hard drive system?   With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are,  is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/ partitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?   So the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this really a problem?     After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers, I have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or to/from the same drive.   That is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that there is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC. 	0

The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and  Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to access the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.  I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me. I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and then to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received,  the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do nothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt int86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 ) the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits ) and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).  Currently, I am at a loss as to what may be wrong.  Any hardware gurus out there want to comment?

 I just talked to a rep for my AT&T mastercard regarding this:  There is no maximum claim, and you only have to notify them of the warranty when the  item needs repair.  If it can't be repaired, you get the amount you paid for it. Curiously though, the AT&T Gold mastercard has a limit of $1000 on claims. Definitely not upgrading to that card...:)  -Bryan 	0
About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with a CD-ROM drive.  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver (I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled correctly by the ASW-410 driver.  So, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their FAX number?  Any assistance appreciated.  Regards  BTW: everything else works fine, certainly seems that Sony have caught up with      the rest with the 641.	0

"  Windows Sources Magazine reviewed a number of 17"" monitors recently and they too said that the Nanao T560i was the best monitor to get if you had the money. But they also said that the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 17 is the next best choice and that it has superb picture quality. This monitor can be had for around $1070.  Has anyone actually seen any of these?

 I don't know the exact meaning of UART, but I think it is something like Universal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter. Normally, the older boards have a 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char they received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the right software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars.    If you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are running a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the cpu cannot work the whole time with one task.   The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.   NO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board, whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port which has the UART on board.   I use a Zyxel1496B with a 16550UART under COHERENT 4.0. I'm very satisfied with it but I think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem.  Michael	0
I recently bought a monichrome VGA monitor for $99 that will do 1024x768 non-interlaced, which seems like a good deal. However, it is a fixed-scan rate monitor, and only handles 52 kHz horizontal, I think. With my Trident card it works only in graphics modes 5e and 62 - not much use, since just about any application will set the mode to something else, especially if it wants to do text, I suppose. Anyway:   - is there any way that I can use this as a general-purpose VGA    display with a 1-meg trident 8900C card?   - if not, can I do so with some sort of different VGA card?

 I think the original respondent (Guy Dawson?) was refering to something much more elementary.  Every partition (whether it is the entire disk or not) has two FATs and an initial directory.  If you have a small disk (50 meg or less), I would recommend that it remain a single partition. Unless you have some other consideration.  If you have a large disk (greater than 200 meg), multiple partitions can make sense. 	0
   Someone Else, could you please comment on that. I have just bought a Twincom 14.4DFi, which has a Rockwell chipset. It wasn't cheap so I would like to hear of problems I'm likely to run into.   Phew, I was lucky! The Twincom internal version has a 550A and one of the Rockwell chips is marked RC144DP.  But still I would like to hear more of the above mentioned firmware problems.	0
" Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI-1 for hard drives YES the ""figure includes a hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers""  This is sloppy people and DUMB.  Ok once again with the SCSI spec list: SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s  asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s. SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}  Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1  so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.  SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit  hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1  devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds} SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak: Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower  {Range 0-5MB/s}  One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by people.  Its PROPER meaning is ""The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2"" Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote: (My comments in {})  PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 ""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI, {This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..."" {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read: {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} ""Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the  speed of IDE..."" or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2} ""Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as ESDI, 20% faster than IDE...""  NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.  SCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers  are VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed degridation(the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.)}"	0
 What group is this?  This is not a MAC group.   Why the spec list again?  We are talking SCSI on a PC, not on a MAC or a UNIX box.  And we are talking ISA bus, or possibly EISA or VLB.  This isin't comp.periphs.SCSI. Tell me what the performance figures are with a single SCSI drive on a PC with an ISA (or EISA or VLB) bus.  Theoretical performance figures are not relevant to this group or this debate.  I'm sure that there are some platforms out there that can handle the 40 megs/sec of SCSI xyz wide'n'fast, but the PC isin't one of them. 	0
"  Your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered to/CMOS is set to (usually wait states) regardless of what speed RAM is installed.  No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use ""slower"" RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash.  Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster RAM.    Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus  slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

" There were an assortment of firmware problems, but that is pretty much expected with any FAX/modem talking with a different FAX or modem which may have also been revised or is new.  I'm pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it from someone else.  However, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation. This is because the MPU used ""speed buffering"" instead of having a 16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the ""speed buffering"" works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial port board.  Hope this helps... Tom "	0

        I've been told by our local computer guru that you can't do this unless you  perform a low level format on your existing hard drive and set your system  up for two hard drives from the beginning.

If anyone knows for sure what the  scoop is, I would like to know also.  Thanks in advance also.	0
 I would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive. XT drives usually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The two are not compatible on the same controller. However, you might be able to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be able to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I think). You might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the XT.	0

 There is a premium of approx $200 for the controller. What is nice is  being able to run hard disks, tape drives, cd-roms and scanners of one dma channel and interupt!  SCSI makes sense is you are going to load up a machine, if you just want a standard box for Windows then IDE makes sense.  I have one loaded box that uses SCSI and run Unix and one standard box that runs DOS/Windows that uses IDE.

 Once in a while you have to put in a good word for something that works well.  I have had no problems with my Toshiba 3401.  It works very well with DOS and OS/2.  For OS/2, you don't need to load any special drivers.  The installation will detect that it is a Toshiba drive and you are done.  BTW, it's also very fast!	0
 Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for!  V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster. This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to video memory.  Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making  cards to fit in the other two.   How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at 130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at just over 1Mb/s.  [ Do do however free the local bus for other cards ]  Some times you need fast busses and sometimes you don't!   Guy	0
Hi, VLB is defined for 3 cards by 33MHz and 2 cards by 40MHz  there are designs with 50MHz and 2 VLB-Slots. (s. C't 9.92, 10.92, 11.92)  50MHz and 2 Slots are realy difficult to design.	0

This is advertised as SCSI-2 in BYTE 4/93:159 FOR the  PC and AT THESE SPEEDS.{NOT the Mac, the PC.}  {I have not seen the following for EITHER the Mac or the PC} SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:  asynchronous range: 0-5MB/s {infered from BYTE 4/93:159}  synchronous range: 0-8.3MB/s.  Note that I ALSO give the AVERAGE through put for SCSI-2 which holds true a Mac OR IBM/PC clone with the correct hardware and software. And since PC ADVERSIZEMENTS are using Theoretical performance figures WHY  CANNOT WE?   With PC articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is NOT with SCSI but with the PEOPLE WHO REPORT IT! {Like YOU.} Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote:  (My comments in {}) ""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..."" {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with  a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 The ARTICLE is confused, NOT SCSI.  The TERM is a mess from inconsitant use NOT because the interface itself is a mess.  SCSI means ""The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2"" NOT 'SCSI-1' as some people want to use it.  To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read: {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} ""Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the  speed of IDE..."" or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2} ""Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as ESDI, 20% faster than IDE...""  NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity."	0

Plus, I get : >technical support over the phone, free software package. : > : Have fun trying to get hold of technical support over the phone.  At least : locally you can walk right up to the dealer and tell him what is wrong, and : he has to fix it.  Phone support is quick and competent from many mail order firms, but not so quick and not so competent from others (Gateway included).  But my experience with computer retailers (which is significant) has lead to the conclusion that sales personnel and retail-technical personnel are forbidden to actually learn about the products they sell.  Talk about incompetent!  O.K., so a few percent of their answers are correct, but those salesmen don't even realize how stupid they are.   ...  .......  O.K.  ...I'll settle down now....  .... let me catch my breath.....  ..  Fact: retail stores never provide a better value in terms of price per product.  Retail outlets are desirable, however, to those people who aren't interested in learning about computers enough to make their own decisions.  This is fine; for example most of my education about carpeting, wall paper, lawn mowers, microwave ovens, etc. has come from sales personnel.  I assume I must be an idiot.  But I don't care about those things.  I do, however, care about my computer - i.e. I demand features and performance, and I'll be damned if I'll pay some high-school drop out commission on an over-rated, over-priced system and in the process be subjected to his distorted B.S.

I recently acquired an AST Hot Shot 286 accellerator board for an 8088 sans documentation.    Does anyone know what the dip switches on the back of the card do?    Did it come with software?

 Maybe its a monitor problem.  You mentioned that you swapped cards, but not monitors.  Perhaps that could be it.  Dan 	0
 No, but some OS's ( COHERENT , etc ) are able to drive one of the ports in polled mode without using the IRQ. In your example, after accessing the modem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used by the modem.   Yes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your other hardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.  If you have only one printerport  ( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4, you can assign IRQ2, if its free. As far as I know, no other IRQ can be used until your I/O-card is 16bit and caould access IRQ's > 8.  Michael	0

"B(>i am interested in getting the pulse of this group regarding B(>extended operation of my G2K 486-33V with the cover removed B(>from the enclosure.  there are a # of reasons i am considering B(>this, including quick access to jumpers during complex i/o card B(>setups.  B(>my concern is that without a complete enclosure to direct the B(>cooling flow of air from the fan, ""hot spots"" may develop on my B(>motherboard or elsewhere.  If you have an adequate supply of air moving over the system (most offices or homes have positive ventilation) you can generally run a system without the cover for extended periods without a problem. (I'm talking about completely removing the cover - not just leaving the slots uncovered.) HOWEVER, the biggest reason you have a cover to begin with is RF sheilding. Operating a system without the full cover may create problems with other equipment such as your neighbor's TV or Ham radio station - very much a no-no in the eyes of the law.    * SLMR 2.1a * Remember - They're only tools, not a way of life!

"OK..... thanks to all of you who responded to my post. here's the ""official"" response from orchid.. Orchid is aware of the problem, the new rev of the board (rev d) SHOULD         (not would) take care of the problem. production was scheduled to start on april 15, I have no confirmation that production did start on this day just the word of the tech on the other line.  now the flame...... you would think a company like Orchid who has produced good quality products in the past would be more helpfull and willing to make right on a screwup of theirs.  very poor tech support (the first 2 times I called I must have spoke with the janitor because they where talking craziness) the last time I talked to a tech  named ""paul"" and he seemed to have a pretty good idea what was going on. until these problems are resovled neither myself nor my department will buy or recommend orchid products.  flame off.....  again thanks to all of you who answered my post."	0
"Hi Netters!  I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about my situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario:  1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).     The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both      systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup /      restore program.  Both systems have 3.5"" and 5.25"" floppies.  2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).  From what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these  options, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees  any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking  (I don't know very much about these beasts):  1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.     Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?     What do the floppies themselves cost?   2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and     continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a     few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any     happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?    3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and     (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)   4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha's or      recommendations for manufacturers?    I appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will summarize all responses for the net.  Thanks,"	0
  you  need to massage few switches in your system.ini. in the virtual memory section, flip the 32bitaccess switch on and the  associated driver (wdctl or some such) switch on.  this will enable 32bit access, but be sure you can use it, as not all hard drives and controllers support it !     ...for seriously fast disk access:  1)  throw out WINDOZE 2)  install OS/2  i did this weekend - OS/2 is incredible.  finally a REAL OS for the humble PC  :)	0

"I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for mine to arrive in the mail. There seems to be a lot of complaints about minor alignment problems with the MX15F. One article contained a comment that the owner called the factory and was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4"").  Well, my monitor arrived last night and, sure enough, it has a very noticable barrel distortion. It's not dramatic, but it is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't fill the entire screen. The fact that it is worse on the right side doesn't help matters.  What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't want to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse problem. Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment?  Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?  -- "	0
"Thanks to all who responded to my original post.  I got the number for Western Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade the BIOS to the Super BIOS.

I mess with this older stuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)       First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.        Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on the board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read  either :     62-000042-015 or              62-000094-0x2       If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.       Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.       Looks right.    [art deleted]         I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:                5 + +    open               6 + +    open                            7 + +    open                       8 + +    open               4 + +    closed               3 + +    closed               2 + +    open               1 + +    open      Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block. Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8 select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the second drive (drive 1).           If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.         See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.         The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few times and banged my head for a day.....        Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:                 -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)         This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.         If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).                       -->   Bob Valentine  <--                     --> ravalent@mailbox.syr.edu <--      From chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za Mon Apr  5 06:33:46 1993 Received: from unitrix.utr.ac.za by ponder (5.61/1.36)  id AA16194; Mon, 5 Apr 93 06:32:59 -0500 Received: by unitrix.utr.ac.za (Smail3.1.28.1 #1)  id m0nfpMA-0001X7C; Mon, 5 Apr 93 13:28 GMT Message-Id: <m0nfpMA-0001X7C@unitrix.utr.ac.za> From: chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za (Prof P.

To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital             XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3            or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT            controller you are using).                                                   -2-                        NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1,            WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in            Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or            ""A"" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2)            instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or            the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the            etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then            solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the            modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1            (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION            TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY            ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the            WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must            be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the            interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

Anybody seen the date get stuck?  I'm running MS-DOS 5.0 with a menu system alive all the time.  The machine is left running all the time.  Suddenly, the date no longer rolls over.  The time is (reasonably) accurate allways, but we have to change the date by hand every morning.  This involves exiting the menu system to get to DOS.  Anyone have the slightest idea why this should be?  Even a clue as to whether the hardware (battery? CMOS?) or DOS is broken?	0
"Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB, I can look up the model number if it's important) and I've been trying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest, since my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.] He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model number but I can find out.)  Anyway, I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both at the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup - never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction sheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS correctly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't know PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers properly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).  The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've tried several combinations:  controller - master - slave controller - slave - master master - controller - slave  None of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.  Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into two seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for ""C: drive"" and ""D: drive"" setup info rather than ""drive 1"" and ""drive 2"" like most others I've seen.  Could this be confusing things?  So, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some info for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper about the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so it looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!  Many, many thanks in advance!  This is practically an emergency (I have two papers to do on this thing for Monday!)!  Help! -- "	0
I own an 8088 640K clone which does all I want except run 1 game I want to buy.  The game says it requires a 80286 with 640K.  Game tech. support says game will run on 8088 but uses a some digitized graphics which would make it run really *slow* (it's a card game - Hoyles Classic Card Games, digitized graphics are photos artwork of game fictional card players).  What can I do to speed up how this game would run, short of an 80286 motherboard upgrade.  Co-processor?  Accelerator card mimicking 80286? My 8088 can run at 10 Mhz.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	0
"  I agree that the image is as sharp as it gets with these SONY tubes, however in the 17"" monitors using these tubes, the 2 annoying black lines on the top and bottom quarters of the tube, which are created due to the wires holding up the Invar Shadow Mask, are quite annoying after a while.  That is the only thing that is making me lean more in favor of the NEC 5FG (or now also available the NEC 5FGe - only difference, no ACCUCOLOR ).

Hi,    I'm currently in the process of writing a number of PD programs for the sound blaster. The first of which is a CMF voice editor which is hopefully going to be available soon (as soon as I can get it to  an FTP site).  Anyway the next stage is to use the midi port to enter music and play the FM synth remotely. The problem is that I have little or no info on the SB midi port.  I have tried using the Sound blaster freedom project routines, however this just results in the port locking after a couple of accesses and loss the of note velocity data byte.  I am using Turbo C and would be grateful for any info or source fragments may help. When I was in Berlin this summer I saw a book which seemed to have all this information, but my German is poor to say the least, if anyone has this book could they please mail me.  My second request for help concerns standard file formats (how can a file  format be standard if you keep it secret ?) I need to know the file format  for instrument bank files *.BNK and Roland music files *.ROL.  Finally does anyone have a source for displaying PCX or GIF files to EGA or VGA monitors.  Please Help, You know it makes sense.	0
  From a recent BYTE magazine i got the following:  [Question and part of the answer deleted]    If you are handy with a soldering iron, the loopback plugs are easy to make.  On a serial RS-232 nine-pin port, use a female DB-9 connector and connect pins 1 to 7 to 8; 2 to 3; and 4 to 6 to 9.  For serial RS-232  25-pin ports, you'll need a female DB-25 connector with pins 1 to 7; 2 to 3; 4 to 5 to 8; 6 to 11 to 20 to 22; 15 to 17 to 23; and 18 to 25 connected.  To test a Centronics 25-pin parallel port, you'll need to connect pins 1 to 13; 2 to 15; 10 to 16; 11 to 17; and 12 to 14 in a male DB-25 connector.       -Stan Wszola ---  I haven't tried it.

I recently purchased the then current Pkg.# 486dx-33 for $2395 (but changed to NEC 3FGx monitor upgrade). Buy this Pkg. #3 now - for $100 more, you now get a bigger HD - 340mb with @256 HD cache. 30 days ago, when I bought this pkg., it was 245mb with @132K HD cache. This is a great deal although it is generally recommended you at least upgrade to the 15' Zeos (CTX) monitor for $99 more I believe.  Whether you also upgrade to the Diamond Viper video card is your choice. I stayed with the Diamond Speedstar Pro. Zeos Tech Support is really good - call after normal business hours to get the  fastest access. The hardest part about buying a Zeos is the wait till it is delivered - once you order you can hardly wait to get it! There are quite a few good mail order houses around - lots of bang for buck with Zeos. 	0
I was just reading in PC Magazine that the peripherals in a PC with an ISA bus can only access 16MB of memory.  Also, that some video cards on the ISA bus look for a memory aperture to map their memory to.  So that if I wanted to put 16MB of memory on my PC, my video card wouldn't have anywhere to map it's memory to.  Can someone explain this in more detail.  Is there a way around this limit.  If you email me a response, I will summarize.  -Bo begolej@csgrad.cs.vt.edu	0
Hi,      I've just replaced my existing DTC SCSI controller with an Adaptec 1542B, and am now having trouble restoring from a Jumbo 250 tape drive.      I had no trouble installing the Adaptec and DOS recognises both the SCSI drive and an existing IDE drive - however when I went to restore the backups from the Jumbo tape I found that it was extremely slow (estimated time 3 mins actual time 15 min!) I have no trouble restoring from the same tape to the IDE drive.      I seem to remember reading that some settings had to be changed to  enable the Jumbo drive and the Adaptec to work together but I can't find any mention of it in the manuals.   My system config is:    i486DX/33 4Mb     Adaptec 1542B running 180Mb Fujitsu SCSI    IDE Controller running 200Mb IDE    Jumbo 250 running off floppy controller on IDE    Any help would be appreciated      Thanks,     Ron.

I have a 486DX33 ISA system with 4 meg.  I am using a Diamond Speedstar HiColor video card with 1 meg VRAM and a standard CTX 14-in SVGA monitor.  When I am running Windows, and I have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping the program manager window), and I close the active application, window erasure is very slow.  The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first, very slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application.  The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it does not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.  Is this slow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there something else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of?  Thanks.	0
   The problem is with ISA bus-masters which can only address the first 16MBs of system memory.  Bus-masters do not use the CPU nor the system DMA to do the actual data transfer but transfer their data directly to the system RAM.  rp93	0

 I purchased a Super Voyager VLB 33Mhz board from Washburn & Company a month ago. I don't have the mailing address-- Clyde Washburn advertises regularly in PC Week.  He can also be reached via CompuServe.    The phone number is     1-800-836-8027.  I think Washburn has very competitive prices compared to other AMI distributers,plus I liked  the fact he's a EE that knows what he's talking about concerning hardware, and he can be easily reached via CompuServe for non   critcle questions, and is very informative to his customers over the phone.	0

    The last I heard, the author was having some problems in his immediate family and had delayed the continuation of development for a time. This was some months ago.  It's a shame.  The driver is the best memory manager I have found ANYWHERE.  It doesn't require V8086 mode (like QEMM) so it works with Ultima 7.  It doesn't take ANY memory (runs, then exits).

there is a file out there (look for it with archie) that is called 'theref22.zip' which has lots of info on various PC things, amongst which is also a detailed description of all Floppy controller commands, I think hard drive controller commands are not there.  it is possible to read an entire track including all gaps, sector headers etc.   by setting sector size to something very large (like 8K).	0

I'm thinking of splashing out on a new motherboard for my PC. I am running Linux as my main OS, with a small DOS partition left for my flatmates' games.  My current setup is a 386SX-25 (AMD) with 387SX-25 (ITT - I think) and 9 Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS, and (120+100)Mbyte IDE.  Basically I have two choices  1) Get a 386DX-40 + 387DX-40  or 2) Get some sort of 486.  Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high. The first option works out at about \pounds 200. 486 m/boards start at this price for a SX-25.  I have a couple of questions.  1) How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a 386DX+copro. Remember I'm using a 32 bit OS, and alot of Floating Point operations.  2) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ?  Should I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait for AMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ?   Any experiences will be most helpful ...    Kenny.  PS. Example prices:   386DX-40+copro M/board ~$270  486DX33 M/board  ~$580  ----------------------------------------------------------- Kenneth MacDonald  E-mail kenny@castle.ed.ac.uk Dept. of Geology & Geophysics University of Edinburgh  Scotland	0
" XGA or XGA-2?  For the original XGA you just need something that can do 1024x768 at 45/90Hz interlaced (just tell them ""8514 compatible"" and they should get the idea).

" I had this problem some time ago.  Some BIOSes do not automatically install  COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which  write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call  fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put  ""device=pf.sys"" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat.  This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS  tables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and  such also if that is of any value to you."	0

Today (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, and you get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of them with 17"" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.  Do not buy a 486SX sytem.  My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When you earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they get you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large steps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX models and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models."	0

We have a Gateway 486DX50 with a SMC Elite16 Series Ethercard Plus.  When we use NCSA FTP to send from the Gateway with hash turned on, we see 4 hash marks immediately.  Then the computer  r e a l l y  drags.  If we turn  off the internal cache of the 486, the speed is better, but doesn't match the speed when we receive to the Gateway.  It doesn't matter if we send from the Gateway or get to it: 4 hash marks and  then extreme slowness if the cache is not disabled.  Does anyone know any more about this?  Is there a fix?

[Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated] If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from?  SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.  SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}  asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}  synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a  rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}  SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from  SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs  this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers  AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the   slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode   4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous  mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}  SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things  over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the  machine and the external device.  Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver  software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.  Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.  SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this  requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING  devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY  expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts  	0
Re: Problems with S3-initialization  As described the manual the following steps must be done for th initialization of the S3 card.  InitDisplay;  (*BIOS-Call   with AX-Reg = 4F02H   with BX-Reg = 105H for 1024 x 768 x 256 resolution   Interrupt 10H *) Unlock Register Lock 1 (CR38)  (* For access to S3 Register Set *) Unlock Register Lock 2 (CR39)  (* For access to Syst. Control and Syst. Extension Register *) Unlock Graphic Command Group (CR40)  (* Set Bit 0 to 1 in Syst. Configuration Register *) Unlock Advanced Display Functions  (* Set Bit 0 to 1 in Function Control Register *)  After these operations the FIFO-stack of the S3 should be empty. When we watch the status (Graph. Proc. Status), we always get the value 0FH instead of 0H. Full would mean 0FFH (8 places occupied), empty would mean 0H (0 places occupied).  It is possible to read this register in two different ways.  Both times we get different results.    Our machine is a 486 DX/2 with EISA bus and a S3 86C805 local bus.   --> any ideas?	0
H E L P !  I have  a problem in which I'm getting increasing frustrated every day...  Some background about my PC:  - American Megatrend BIOS (clone 386 SX) with 32M of RAM - config.sys file:   device=c:\dos\himem.sys  dos=high,umb  device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems  files=30  buffers=30  stack=9,256  - autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c - CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram.  The problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31  I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL. Run excel, no problem. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place for windows.  Ok, I then proceed to install Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:). The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse) from the desktop. First of all, I always get the application error screen followed by another application error screen with various different messages. The following are some of them:  - Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some   number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture) - General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address - Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address  Some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address 0001:XXXX means?   I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the TSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help.  Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.  Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to try anything. 	0
"Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways lately on here, I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. My machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in.      Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the  peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway  documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and  has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a  lot to do with it.      It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications.  I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then ""maps"" the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can ""cd"" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the  peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.     My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!    So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)        John  "	0

I just installed a DX2-66 CPU in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a CPU  cooler on the chip.  After about 1/2 hour, the weight of the cooler was enough  to dislodge the CPU from its mount.  It ended up bending a few pins on the CPU, but luckily the power was not on yet.  I ended up pressing the CPU deeply into its socket and then putting the CPU cooler back on.  So far so good.  Have others had this problem?  How do you ensure that the weight of the CPU fan and heatsink do not eventually work the CPU out of its socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case? 	0

As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of   late.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every   day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I   can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same   application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I   need to re-boot.  Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I   first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many   GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows   (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.  The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves   the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't.   I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's   in the sppace of 20 minutes?  What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software   problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After   Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or   gdi.exe.  Any help is truly appreciated.....  -Eric	0

Perusing through my Windows 3.1 directory, I came across a file called REGLOAD.EXE.  I assume this is part of the registration database, but neither my Windows manual, Win Resource Kit, nor PC Mag's description of files in the Windows directory had a reference to it.  At least not one that I could find.  Does REGEDIT.EXE use it?  Or am I way off base? 	0
Hi, anyone have the latest drivers for the Actix Graphics Accelerator Card?  (32 plus) The one I have (version 1.21) seem to have a lot of problems.  I believe the latest version is 1.3 and would someone please  upload it to some ftp site so that I can download it.   Thanks    --    Daniel Y.H.

"This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two new newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The proposed groups are described below:  NAME:   comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about   system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.  NAME:  comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,   including issues such as security, networking features, console   mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.  RATIONALE:  Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family  of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish  to argue about the meaning of an ""OS"").  The family ranges from  Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to  Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over  50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the  actual release is slated for May/June '93.   While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares  an application programming interface with the other members of the  Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-  dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking  and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for  Windows 3.1.   The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows  3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses  Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-  sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced  Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and  NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.   Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following  groups with the other members of the Windows family:   comp.os.ms-windows.apps   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32    The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as  well as Windows 3.1:   comp.os.ms-windows.announce   comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy    In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the  Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal  structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating  systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have  undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate  newsgroup hierarchies.   Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --  when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-  generation Windows, ""Chicago"", debuts next year, surely it should  remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-  tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?   DISCUSSION PERIOD:  The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.    VOTING:  The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on  the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will  be accepted prior to the CFV."	0
   I have the same card, TVGA-8900c. When I checked, the latest driver for windows 3.1 is dated Aug. 92 in garbo.uwasa.fi in /win31/drivers/video. If you find a better version (updated) please let me know, Thanks. 	0

(NOTE: The followups are set to comp.os.os2.misc.  DMQS files describe monitors and valid modes to be used by the XGA-2 under both Windows and OS/2.)  THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  IBM has nothing to do with these files or this post.  It's personal this time (and every time I post -- see the signature).  Due to demand and requests, here are some additional DMQS files I've collected for the XGA-2.  These files function with the latest revision of the drivers for the XGA-2.  Not all these files will work under Windows with the drivers available to the general public at this time.  All files will function under the most recent OS/2 2.1 beta and those I've tried have worked under OS/2 2.0+SP.  Not all files have been fully tested.  THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  They represent a personal collection, not anything resembling an officially supported set.  As a standard disclaimer I would like to point out the following facts: 1) Some of these files may run your adapter out of spec.  Doing so can    stress the ICs on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in    shorter life (how short depends on how much out of spec [boom!] :-). 2) Some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of    spec for your monitor, resulting in damage to your monitor. 3) You should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter's ability    to use the mode you select.  Using these files represents hacking    in a very true sense, so practice safe computing and don't play    around too much if you don't like the risks and aren't knowledgable    about what you're doing. 4) If you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings, use the DMQS files    you have or wait until IBM releases official, tested DMQS files.    Although you should be aware of warning 2) even with the IBM files.  THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  By using them you may invalidate your warrenty.  Not all have been fully tested -- I don't have that many monitors.  Installation: unpack in your DMQSPATH environment variable, usually c:\xga$dmqs.  Then use the methods described in your XGA-2 installation diskette to change your adapter or settings.  Packing: these files have been packed with the latest INFOZIP utility.   You will need PKZip 2.x if you don't have the INFOZIP utilities.  Submitting:  feel free to send me uuencoded versions of your favorite DMQS files for your favorite monitors.  I'm always interested in collecting more.  Archive:  these files have been uploaded to ftp-os2.nmsu.edu in pub/uploads/xga2dmqs.zip.	0
Is their a pd/freeware hard drive utility that can handle a compressed IDE drive without screwwing it up?  Need to document occasional failures in reading/writing, check overall integrity of disk's hardware and sectors.  I believe that all of my problems with DOS/Windows can be isolated to my drive.  Getting occasional corrupted files, even with smartdrive, 32 bit access turned off. Had these problems under DOS 5.  Only with drive C. Drive D may have had one failure, but that file was under the control of Win/Winword on drive C.  All utilities available to me report no problems. DOS, NDD (NU4.5).  Another symptom, SD took forever on C, and kicked me out with a suspension till NDD run 6 to 8 times.  Thanks. 	0

Hello,      I'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application Framework.  I have come across a few that look good:    Zapp 1.1 from Inmark   Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software   C++/Views from Liant   Win++ from Blaise  Some considerations I'm using:    Being new to Windows programming (I'm from the UNIX/X world), the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very  important.  However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows programming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the sake of changing the API, are valuable.    Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less important.     We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch components from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff  (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.  The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).  A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:  ZApp ----   Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and     also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.   Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)   Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.   Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.   Zinc ----   Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)   Comes with a interface builder tool   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.     Had a better demo :-)  Both have source code availability options Both are lacking OLE support Neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff   Any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated,  Thanks,   Brett Harper 	0
"In comp.os.ms-windows.misc you write:   you might want to look in windows FAQ for this one, but here is my best explanation.  But I can't guarantee that I'm not way off base...  The permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that). Windows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that points to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file.  compressed disks are actually ""logical"" disks.  These disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the BIOS level).  Because of this ""inbetween"" program, windows cannot use direct methods to read from the ""logical"" disk.  a permenant swap file is only there to ""reserve"" an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don't know if it does or doesn't...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows.)  a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows via DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded the file access must go through DOS...TSR'S (disk compression)...and BIOS in order to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER)  more on permenent swap files...  i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message ""you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested size...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan't to create this swap file anyway"" or something like that.  well, a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why. what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers.  They also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size.  Well...that's what he  said!  I call bull@#$#.  If this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if it's not going to use it?  any takers?  James"	0

"Hi there,  We are running a 120 node Token ring with Windows 3.1 and Novell 3.11.  Every once in a while, we run into ""The Black Screen of Death"", a phrase coined by Robert X. Cringely in a recent InfoWorld column.    Basically, sometimes when you quit Windows, the screen goes black and you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your screen.  Also, sometimes when you exit to DOS, the same effect occurs. Cringely hints that Microsoft and/or Novell has a patch for Windows' virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this.  Neither company seems to know what I am talking about when I call them.  Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon?    Is there a fix for it?  Any response is welcome."	0

  If you need just to change the wallpaper, then I've written a short program in VB that does this by using SystemParametersInfo-function. The bad news is that you need VBRUN200.DLL to run it, and the DLL is some 350kb (the program is about 7kb). The order of pictures depends on the system date and the number of BMP-files in the directory, so the picture remains the same if you execute the program multiple times during the same day and the number of BMPs has not changed.  If you feel this is what you need then I could uuencode it and email it to you. (It is unavailable via ftp.) 	0

Hi.  I am having some interesting problems with my Boca graphics card, which  is based on the Cirrus Logic chipset (I am not sure exactly which one).  The problem is as follows:  If I use any Windows driver at 800x600 except for the 64K-colour driver (ie 16 colour or 256 colour), the image on screen becomes too tall - no amount of resizing on the monitor will make it fit.  And if I use Excel with the 64K- colour driver, it hangs as soon as it loads.  Anyone out there used this card/experienced anything similar.  Please reply by mail, and I will post any solutions here.  Regards    - Simon   -- 	0

Hi,   I am working on gathering data on the way that users use computers. This involves getting subjects to type and use a  mouse. I want to be able to watch what they are doing without  being in the same room. It would be ideal if I could watch the session on another monitor without the subjects knowledge. I believe that spliting the monitor cable will only work for short distances, ie <5m. I will need to be approx 10m away, as the cable travels.

I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using mouse.com 8.00 (was using 8.20  I think, but switched to 8.00 to see if it was any better).  Vertical motion  is nice and smooth, but horizontal motion is so bad I sometimes can't click  on something because my mouse jumps around.  I can be moving the mouse to  the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly  for a bit, then jump to the right, then move smoothly for a bit then jump  again (maybe this time to the left about .5 inch!).  This is crazy!  I have  never had so much trouble with a mouse before.  Anyone have any solutions?

   I think George is referring to switch.zip in the ~ftp/pub/pc/win3/drivers/video directory. Description reads -- Switcher: Windows Video Mode Switcher. 	0

 I've been using MS Access (still available from some stores for $99.00) and I am quite pleased with it.  It's relatively easy to learn, very easy to use and somewhat easy to program.  I highly recomend it, particularly at $99.00!  I have not used Paradox for Windows, but I don't expect it to be $30.00 better than Access (IMHO). 	0
Does anyone out there use a SIGMA designs VIDEO/SOUND card ? The model is called WIN-STORM-PC  . They also have one model the  Legend-24lx  Any info on these like performance and compatibility, or even problems encountered will be appreciated.	0

 There are some things you might be interested to know about today's RISC processors.  It is true that there are fewer instructions, but what is  not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to swell, so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications. As a compromise, many RISC processors today are actually a cross between a Reduced Instructions Set, and a Complex one.  This is not to say that there is no future in CISC processors, Intel has  certainly proved that.  What I want to know, is what does this have to do with this group?  -dave    Subject: Re: WP-PCF, Linux, RISC?

Whenever I exit Windows, I can't use control-alt DEL to reboot my   computer, because the system hangs when I do this. I can still reboot   using the reset key, but I would like to know why this happens..  Eric	0
"To all hardware and firmware gurus:  My current home project is to build a huge paddle keyboard for a  physically handicapped relative of mine.  My goal is for this keyboard to look exactly like an AT sytle keyboard to its host system. This will be a highly endowed keyboard with a Little PCL from Z World at its heart.  The only thing I lack is detailed information on the hardware signaling that the 486 (with  Windows 3.1  and DOS 5.0) will be  expecting.  My project is independant of Windows, my hope is that some of you fellow Window's users/programmers will recognize what I need and be  willing to point me in the right direction.   I have The Winn L. Rosch Hardware Bible (2nd edition).  The HB gives most (if not all) of the information I will need concerning scan codes  and even a wire diagram for the PS/2 style connector I will need, but it  leaves a number of important questions unanswered. 1.  Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication?  I'm     guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock.  In either     event, how is the data framed? 2.  Is it half-duplex or truly one way?  I'm guessing half-duplex     since the host can turn LEDs on and off. 3.  Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the ""AT     keyboard standard"" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)?  If anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source of information) on the above, please advise me at gamet@erg.sri.com. Whatever I do it must be safe for I cannot afford to replace the 486 in the event of a booboo.  Thank you for your time. Danke fuer Ihre Zeit."	0
Hi,  We've been having problems on a few setups when printing to a serial printer (dmp or Laser). I have used Works and Windows Write. The output is OK from DOS and if I send plain text output, but anything fancy garbles or just doesn't output. The exception is outputting to a Lserjet 4 which 'appears' to be fast enough receiving data, not to bother about handshaking messages. I'm sure I'm not alone in this. I've tried most of the Print/Network manager options I can think of. Anyone had similar problems they've cured and would like to tell me 'bout it?? Thanks	0
"Walther, I'd have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card and screen would have without flickering. I'd only suggest using the color screen if it does 800*600 without flickering. If this is not too small for your tastes at a 14"".... Personally I'd prefer the mono-screen as I always have quite a few windows open. If you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the color 'surplus' is worth trading in  the smaller size. If you want to develop programs you will always have to check the colors. I used a 14"" mono screen (worst of both worlds) and was surprised how the colors looked I choose on a color screen."	0
 Not true! Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.  TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.   Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.    Hope this clears up some of the confusion. Feel free to contact me if anyone would like more info.  Regards,	0

What files do I need to download for GhostScript 2.5.2?  I have never used GhostScript before, so I don't have any files for it.  What I *do* have is gs252win.zip, which I downloaded from Cica.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work on it's own, but needs some more files that I don't have.  I want to run GhostScript both in Windows 3.1 and in MS-DOS on a 386 PC (I understand there's versions for both environments).  What are all the files I need to download and where can I get them?  Any info would be appeciated.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Steve W Brewer                                                rewerB W evetS   cl238405@ulkyvx.louisville.edu                ude.ellivsiuol.xvyklu@504832lc	0
I recently purchased a Diamond Stealth 24 Video card and received the wrong drivers.  Does anyone know where I can ftp the windows video drivers for the Stealth 24. I tried the drivers at cica and they don't work. The right drivers are on the Diamond BBS but the file is almost 1 meg and it would take a while to download them at 2400 baud.  Any information would be appreciated.  Please contact me at doug@sun.sws.uiuc.edu  Thank you	0

"   ...stuff deleted   According to the April issue of PC Magazine (pg. 139), and I quote,  ""Eventually, Windows NT is likely to be ported to every successful RISC architecture.  PowerPC and HP's PA-RISC are the two most likely candidates, with SPARC somewhat less likely because of Sun's relatively strong UNIX software base."""	0
  Yup.  We're using both and they work just fine.  Hopefully, someday WFWG will communicate over LWP TCPIP.  Right now we have to load NetBeui.	0
Does anyone out there know if there are print drivers for Windows for the Panasonic KX-P1091i 9-pin dot matrix printer? 	0
  This is silly. Is Unix a mature OS? Depends on who you ask, and how you define mature. System 7 is, if anything, less mature than Windows 3.1.    So why do you need something like BeHierarchic to create groups under the Apple Menu? Everyone knows that Apple Menu Items are a ripoff of the Program Manager. If you want a hierarchic program launcher there are lots available.   And this is easy on a Mac? Give me a break. Having spent hours moving System Extensions around and restarting the Mac to see why a certain app crashes all the time, I find this laughable.   Oh great. Ever hear of aliases? Wonder why Apple implemented them.   Eh?? I don't follow.   Why is it that I find the Mac desktop incredibly annoying whenever I use it?    Yeah right. You post flame bait, yet ask for no flames.          -- 	0

"I have been experiencing several end-user problems with various commercial software packages (WordPerfect 5.2/WIN, Publish It!/WIN 3.1) and printing landscape mode on a Citizen PN48 (the little guy) or the Citizen GSX-140+.  In a nutshell the problem is that I lose the first 0.625 inches of information from my left margin, be it white space or TrueType font output, and margins are not preserved on subsequent pages past the first.  WordPerfect had a workaround consisting of using the ""Default"" location for the printers instead of ""Tractor"" or ""Manual"".  They have also filed this as a bug and are continuing to investigate it.  MS Write, of course, has no problem with these printer drivers, proving that Microsoft knows something the rest of us don't!  Are you surprised?  I'm not.  Publish It!/WIN is still investigating this problem, and while I was consider- my options (rejecting the one about buying an $800 DTP package, for *surely* they wouldn't have this problem, right?) I stumbled onto a global workaround.  WORKAROUND ---------- Go into the Windows 3.1 control panel, select printers, select your Citizen printer driver, select SETUP, and select a custom size of 850 x 1132.  Like magic, all of your problems will go away.  Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies!  -- Mike   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Disclaimer: My opinions do not necessarily reflect those of my employer. ========================================================================"	0
A couple of weeks ago I posted a question concerning communicating between VB and MSACCESS using DDE. The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However, during this process I have come up with new problems.  1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB?  2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.      The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends.  Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any signs of an ODBC driver for Access?	0
"Reposting and summarizing, for your information or additional comment.  *** THIS IS LONG ***  I have 16MB of memory on my 386SX (25 MHz), an Intel math coprocessor, and a 120MB hard drive with 20MB free (no compression).  I have been running Mathcad 3.1, under Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode, with a 5MB RAM drive, 2MB/1MB Smart drive, and no swap file (permanent or temporary) for several months.  I am interested in the faster Mathcad 4.0, but I am concerned about reported swap file requirements and the legitimacy of Mathsoft's claim about increased speed.

Hi,   I have a simple question. Is it possible to create a OVERLAPPED THICKFRAME window without a title bar; ie   (WS_OVERLAPPED | WS_THICKFRAME) & ~WS_CAPTION    I don't seem to be able to get rid off the title bar.  I have another question:  I have a overlapped window(say V) which has few child windows (a,b,c, etc) The window shows up with all it's children fine. Now, I create another  child(t) with a WS_THICKFRAME style and placed on top of one or more of it's siblings. Style WS_THICKFRAME is used so that I can resize it. How do I make sure that the child 't' will always be at the top of it's siblings. I used SetWindowPos() and BringWindowToTop() without success. What's happening is that while I am resizing 't' it shows up but as soon as I let go, it goes behild it's siblings.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Manu 	0
"Please reply via EMail...  When I use the terminal software for Windows such as TERMINAL.EXE or  Crossttalk, it doesn't use the whole window.  I mean, when the software's window size is max, it still scrolls around the 2/3 of window.  It does not use whole window.  I set ""stty rows 30"", but still the same. Scrolls at 2/3 from the top of the windows.  Could anyone tell me how to setup these software to use whole window?"	0

Chicago from what I have read is projected to run in 4M on 386 and higher. It is definitely aimed at the desktop.  It  is rumored to offer preemptive multitasking, multithreading but will not offer multiprocessing. Is 32 bit and no reliance on DOS. It is rumored to have an integrated file and program manager.  DOS 7 is rumored to be similar to Chicago but without the GUI. Is also a step towards CAIRO (the next generation OS) which is rumored to be  object oriented. I wonder where Windows 4.0 fits here is it a stepping stone to Chicago? Hope this helps. Thx Dave L    	0

When I execute it under windows the screen goes blank and my PC locks up.  The only way for me to return is to reset the machine.  Does anyone have any insight on what I may have to do in order for the program to correctly under windows?

   The 5426 has its own set of drivers. You may be using the drivers intended for the 5420 or 5422 by mistake.  Be sure you have the 5426 driver version 1.2   Don't quote me on this one, but I'd steer clear of the multi resolution driver that allows you to change resolution without exiting Windows.  I think it's buggy.   Version 1.3 drivers are due to be release by Cirrus soon. Unfortunately, their not available via FTP, you have to dial up their BBS in the USA.

Is anyone out there running a MS-DOS system with a LocalTalk board? I am on an Appletalk network, hooked up with a DayStar Digital LT200 MC LocalTalk Interface Board, running on a PS/2 Model 70. I'm using the AppleShare PC software for file server and network access. It works fine under DOS or the Window or OS/2 DOS box. But when I try to load it *before* Windows, so that every application I run could get access to it, the machine crashes hard as soon as I start up an application. And of course, things look pretty hopeless for OS/2 (but who knows).   So, does anyone have experience with this bizarre and obsolete setup?	0

" I hope this will clear it up :  (Taken from one of my lecture notes)   "" ...  The alternative approach (to CISC),  which has been adopted by many in  recent years, has come to be known as ""RISC"": the Reduced  Instruction Set Computer.  This can be characterised simply as  ""Simpler is Faster""; by simplifying the design (e.g.  by reducing  the variety of instructions & addressing modes), the hardware can be  designed to run faster.  Even at the cost of needing more  instructions, the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler,  faster design.   A typical RISC processor will:      o provide a large number of registers (e.g.  32);      o perform all data operations on registers;      o provide few addressing modes (e.g. immediate or 'register + offset');      o only allow load & store operations to access memory;      o only use a few instruction formats;      o only support a few data types (e.g. integer, unsigned, floating)."	0

I am having something very unusual happen.  First  some background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive,  and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on  it.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician  Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by  having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is  necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it,  and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard  drive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad  sectors a week.           Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with  an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this  message twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program  and did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining  for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about  sectors for a brief period of time.           I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the  exact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the  same error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went  to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough  there was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG,  but removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors,  either audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the  cache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.           Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix  them, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are  no errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other  files, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them  for a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to  completely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through  the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.           Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on  my hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in  about every 100 files are affected.             I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s  system, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about  smartdrv to help me out. 	0

     I had the same problem.  At first, I thought it was the video driver and    made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most   evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didn't help and after a bit of   experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard VGA   resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.      My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It   worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the    guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed   a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.   So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer   one.      --  signoff	0
A co-worker of mine needs to convert a postscript file to a form readable (ie ascii) in windows or DOS. Does anybody know of a utility that will do this? I have a vague memory of a shareware utility someone mentioned once...  Thanks for any info,	0

Our student association runs a small Novell network which has a subnetwork of Windows for Workgroups and Microsoft Mail. The Director of Finance, en electrical engineering student, would like to gateway this system, either via SLIP or not, into the University's network and thus the Internet, at the very least to exchange e-mail, but possibly also to do ftp's etc. For now, this would be done via a 9600 bps modem.  He would like to set it up so that it would periodically call in to check mail, but would otherwise connect whenever needed.  What is the best way to do this? Gatewaying software is available, but what works best?  Please reply to me: dkmiller@unixg.ubc.ca  or the D of F    : dleung@ee.ubc.ca  with a cc: to the other. I don't read all of these groups regularly, so mail is best. If this is a common question, please pot me to a FAQ or ftp site.	0
Hi!  I will like to know if there is a FORTRAN library for MS-Windows v3+ out there.  I have several lots of source code written by past A/Ps in MS-FORTRAN, and recently have needed to port them to MS-Windows... I would like to avoid a major code-rewrite if possible - maybe a WINDOWS library is all I need?  Please help - reply by E-mail to:  traversmorgan@swell.actrix.gen.nz	0
  ...   Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the   maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the  characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility  in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font  file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters  appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on.  Well, yes, both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters. And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI in Windows, and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac.  No difference there between T1 and TT!     And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliaty rather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 characters is very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy price in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment there is only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')   For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows  char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font  is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac  char set.    Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which is a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.  The question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example, you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though a font may very well have them.  ANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a new Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allow you do this.  How do I reencode a TrueType font?  How can I get at the `fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows (or on the Mac)?  Are there utilities that make it possible to circumvent the hard-wired Windows ANSI encoding?      > Regards,                                            1001-A East Harmony Road    > Bob Niland                                          Suite 503    > Internet:  rjn@csn.org                              Fort Collins CO 80525    > CompuServe: 71044,2124                              (303) 223-5209 	0
Hi I'm having a problem with TrueType fonts in WIndows 3.1. I have installed the Cyrillic fonts I found on CICA and now a strange thing happens: Sometimes windows uses Cyrillic when its supposed to use Times Roman. Examples: The PC-Tools Backup (version 7.1) has one line of Cyrillic text in its opening banner, the next to last line. Importing a Word for Windows text written in Times into WP5.2 also results in Cyrillic. Does anyone have an idea where to look for the problem? Thanks	0
I am not sure whether I am here in the right area, but does  anybody here know whether Windows NT does/will include a X  Windows server so that it can run X Window applications  remotely? This is because we are considering at our university  to use PC's for word processing and program development,  whereas the bigger jobs are to be run either on SUN  workstations or on Fujitsu super computers.   Thank you very much in advance, Hein.	0

While there are too many PS clones to count, some of which are quite poor, trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require some patience. Three questions come to mid real quick for something like this.  Q: Which version of Adobe PS will we clone?  Aside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, Adobe has in the past released  new code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other  software vendors do. The level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but I assure  you,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to  dwindle in the face of competition. This allows them to shift people to  maintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3.  Q: Do we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly?  From the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs. (If I had  a number to call at HP or Adobe, they'ld have heard from me.) Deciding  which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate.  Q: Do we follow the Red Book, or do we follow someone's implementation?  Without a doubt, there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's  PS. With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does  leave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. It would be  nice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two  different implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given  an identical set of conditions.  Q: PSCRIPT.DRV?  Having done a lot of PS clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of  testing is the limited number of sources for test files. The primary  source we use is Genoa. And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files,  (1300+ of them) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV. It may not ideal,  but the ATS files are what the printer vendors use. I'm sure that Adobe  uses them too, but Adobe's output is by definition correct, even if its  wrong.  Yes, there are some very poor clones. We've seen them here at Rastek (a sub of Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript). Some are poor for lack of design, some are poor because they followed the Red Book, and some are poor because the vendors don't know what PS is.	0
Does anyone know of bigger raster fonts?  I'm using a Mag 15H monitor with a Diamond SS24X in 1280x1024 mode and would prefer to have larger characters for the windows heading (practically for everything).  I'm already using the 8514 character sets.  mark	0

Hi,  I found what I believe is an undocumented feature in my windows directory, Microsoft Diagnostics, ver 2.00. I am specifically interested in a more in depth explanation of the legends in the memory mapping report.  Thanks.	0

"Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for Windows 3.1.  I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's MS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some sites in the U.S.  The three I found were:  1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)                                 This was the smallest and simplest    of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.    It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra    button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the    title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press    a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would    have been nice if there was an ""ALWAYS ON TOP"" setting for the little    window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified    strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be    a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace    manager makes it an attractive package.  2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)                                While this workspace manager offered a    few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming    to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace    is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take ""snapshots""    of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what     applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,    but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.    With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in    a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this    viewing functionality which is quite useful.  3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)                             This is an interesting package, which contains    a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies    include ""Backmenu"", which provides a pop-up root menu when you    press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu    is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,    which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could    say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also    bundled in ""backdesk.zip"" is a program called ""WRUN"", which allows    you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS    instead of using the File Manager to run applications.      The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite    differently to the other two workspace managers in that it    doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.    In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,    and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to    focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different    viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which    each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window    allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically    the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area    while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up    of a particular section."	0

It is correct that VC++ is NOT considered an upgrade for C7. C7 is basically a DOS product, VC++ is a Windows product. As Windows is not an upgrade for DOS, it is a separate operating system product line, its utilities cannot be upgrades for DOS utilities. However, I have also been told that it is NOT an upgrade for QCWIN, which it should be! 	0

Software that comes together with the VideoBlaster is designed to work together with the SoundBlaster (from the same manufacturer).  Since I do not own a SoundBlaster: is there a possibility to use the PC Speaker driver to play audio files for the VideoBlaster (.AVI = audio video interleave files) ?  I think what I should have is a device driver for the Media Player that controls the PC Speaker Driver instead of the SoundBlaster card (something like MCISPKR.DRV).  Has anybody heard of such a driver? Or am I on the wrong track?  Any information on this appreciated!  (Please send e-mail, since I don't watch this group regularly.) 	0

 Somewhere (ftp.cica.indiana.edu or SIMTEL20 mirror) there is a program   called winlogo.zip that does the trick. It works great.

  While I do not speak for Peter Tattam, I am fairly sure he is planning a  Winsock compliant version.  While this will definitely not make the initial public release of WinTrumpet, it will follow on shortly thereafter.  Currently WinTrumpet is in very late beta.  It looks like an excellent  product, with several features beyond the DOS version.  WinTrumpet supports the Trumpet TCP, Novell LWP, and there is also a direct to  packet driver version that some people are using with the dis_pkt shim.  Ashok  	0

  I don't believe IRQ5 is the problem. I tried a mouse on COM3, IRQ4 (the usual place) and it still did not like it. Simply, Windows seems to only support mice on COM1 or COM2. The funny part is, though, that Microsoft's own mouse driver (8.xx) was quite happy with my mouse sitting on COM3. Why can't Windows use the mouse driver, or at least support COM3? :-)   I've tried this too. Actually, I wanted to be able to use my second modem (COM3/IRQ5) from Windows. It still will not talk to that modem. I created two profiles, AMSTRAD (for my Amstrad modem on COM1/IRQ4) and MAESTRO (for my Maestro on COM3/IRQ5). It will not talk to the Maestro at all.   Nor here. (Windows 3.0).   I've seen nothing like that. I've experimented with Logitech's mouse driver too, with no sucess.   If you have a SoundBlaster Pro, it should support IRQ10 as well. Finally, a board that supports IRQs >9. The only one I have (except my IDE controller).  hamish 	0
Hello,  I'm trying to get a drum program to work that I downloaded from ftp.cica.indiana.edu in the pub/pc/win3/sounds directory.  It's called drum.zip.    I have an ATI Stereo FX card with the latest Windows drivers installed.  When I try to run the drum program, it reports that a MIDI device is not installed, however the drivers utility in the control panel reports that it is installed.    Anyone have any idea how to set up the MIDI device so that the drum program will work with my setup?  What I'm trying to do is use my computer as a metronome.  Someone suggested that I try one of the drum machines that are circulating around out there.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks,  Terry	0

Hello,  I thought this problem might have something to do with Windows 3.1 SMARTDRV and a VESA video card...any ideas???  I recently purchased a 486DX-33 machine and am having problems where the  machine will suddenly freeze or reboot.  This may happen in Windows 3.1 or DOS  5.0.  Sometimes it is after printing a document, sometimes after using the  mouse, and sometimes just when I am sitting there.  Twice when it happened, the  machine rebooted and sounded seven beeps.  I looked in the documentation and  the seven beep code meant a problem with interrupts.  The machine has the  following configuration and files:  486DX-33 AMI BIOS 5.25 and 3.5 floppies 170 Meg IDE hard drive 256k cache Microsoft compatible mouse on com1 Citizen GSX-145 on lpt1 NI SuperVGA Monitor with VESA Windows Accelerator Card w/ 1Meg Two VESA slots Windows 3.1 DOS 5.0  CONFIG.SYS ========== DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS DOS=HIGH DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE FILES=20 BUFFERS=20 STACKS=9,128  AUTOEXEC.BAT ============ @ECHO OFF LH C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE 1024 PROMPT $p$g PATH C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS;C:\MOUSE LH C:\MOUSE\MOUSE SET TEMP=C:\DOS LH C:\DOS\DOSKEY    When the machine freezes, I can't use the mouse or keyboard or use Ctrl-Alt-Del  to reboot.  If any one can give me any help, I would greatly appreciate it.  If  anyone can help configure this machine for the best efficiency (memory wise) I  would appreciate that also. --  Douglas B.

ok, i have a 486dx50(ISA) w/ Diamond Stealth VRAM 1MB. I was really satisfied w/ its performance in windows. but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in DOS' VGA, especially this new Strike Commander. ;-) this stealth vram can only give me 17.5 fps. ;-( (i use 3dbench). my winmark was 6.35 million, i think.  so right now i'm considering to replace it w/ a new card, which hopefully can perform approx same w/ my current VRAM in windows and also can perform DOS' VGA preferably >30fps.  i also saw the 3dbench benchmark list from someone who compiled it in csipg and it looked that SpeedStar 24X and Orchid Prodesigner 2d-s ware the fastest for non local bus motherboard. both can give >30fps in DOS' VGA w/ 486dx2/66. Does anyone have a winmarks for both of those cards above with the processor type ? which one is the worthiest(not necessarily fastest)? any other card recommendation is welcomed too.  also, if possible, where can i get 'this' card for the cheapest? ;-)  thanks in advance, folks!	0

I have the local bus card also, and don't have any such problems with it now, but this is the second card I've gotten - the first card didn't work in VGA mode correctly.  Maybe they still have some quality control problems. I would suggest checking with ATI (I went through the vendor I bought the card from since the problem showed up immediately).  I never was able to get through to ATI's technical support number.    I sure like the way the card performs though.  I have the 2MB ATI ultra pro - local bus, and it is fast even in 1024x768x16bpp mode.   Cheers, Phil  	0

"According to BBC Radio this morning, UK, Denmark, Portugal & a few others have vetoed a proposal to limit EC-sold bikes to 100 BHP.  The reason is that such a limit is not supported by accident statistics - a rare example of governmental wisdom.  The limit has a five year moratorium on it, and ""specialist"" manufacturers will be exempt anyway.

    I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.    This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride    (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty,     fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).  I'd say this is a very bad idea - you should start out with something much mellower so that neither one of you get in over your head. That particular road requires full concentration - not the sort of thing you want to take a passenger on for the first time.  Once you both decide that you like riding together, and want to do something longer and more challenging, *then* go for a hard core road like Mines-Mt. Hamilton.  In any case, it's *your* (moral) responsibility to make sure that she has proper gear that fits - especially if you're going sport riding.	0

 Moreover, if two riders are riding together at the same speed, one might be riding well beyond his abilities and the other may have a safety margin left.   Allan, I know the circumstances of several of your falls. On the ride when you fell while I was next behind you, you made an error of judgement by riding too fast when you knew the road was damp, and you reacted badly when you were surprised by an oncoming car.  That crash was due to factors that were subject to your control.  I won't deny that there's a combination of luck and skill involved for each of us, but it seems that you're blaming bad luck for more of your own pain than is warranted. --	0
" A word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable locks under the Kryptonite name.  When I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite  U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for a new lock for the bicycle.  For about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock (advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both, Kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel). I chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.  First, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by the Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable lock with the Kryptonite name on it.  Secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I don't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes it would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.  Thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the  dark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the  lock mechanism would stand up to an ""insert screwdriver and TORQUE"" attack.  Fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to  deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient you can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  Aviation snips would go  through the cable in well under a minute.    -- "	0

The specific recommandation cited in the Hurt study was that a formal ""street strategy"", like SIPDE for example, was the most important component of any rider education curriculum.

" <...> <...>   I've never liked my passengers to try and shift their weight with the  turns at all... I find the weight shift can be very sudden and  unnerving. It's one thing if they're just getting comfortable or  decide to look over your other shoulder, but I don't recommend having  him/her shift her weight with each turn... too violent.    Also (I think someone already said this) make sure your passenger  wears good gear. I sometimes choose to ride without a helmet or  lacking other safety gear (depends on how squidly I feel) but I  won't let passengers do it.

Several years ago, while driving a cage, a dog darted out at a quiet intersection right in front of me but there was enough distance between us so I didn't have to slow down. However, a 2nd dog suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and the force of the impact was enough to kill that Scottish Terrier.  Apparently, it was following the 1st dog. Henceforth, if a dog decides to cross the street, keep an eye out for a 2nd dog as many dogs like to travel in pairs or packs.   I've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I which has a pretty loud OEM horn (not as good as Fiamms, but good enuff) but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards. I'd def feel more vulnerable on my '68 Trump as that'd be easier leg chewing target for those mongrels.  If there's a persistent dog running after bikers despite complaints to the owner I wouldn't be adverse to running over it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much IMHO compared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the ground by said dog and dies from a head injury.

So it looks like I'm going to have to put a couple of bikes in storage for a few months, starting several months from now, and I'm already contemplating how to do it so they're as easy to get going again as possible. I have everything under control, I think, besides the batteries. I know that if I buy a $50.00 Battery Tender for each one and leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage, they'll be fine. But I'm not sure that's necessary. I've never heard anyone discussing this idea, so maybe there's some reason why it isn't so great. But maybe someone can tell me.  Would it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries, drain the electrolyte into separate containers (one for each battery), seal the container, close up the batteries, and leave them that way? Then it would seem that when the bikes come out of storage, I could put the electrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully charged. What's wrong with this?  On a related, but different note for you Bay Area Denizens, wasn't there someone who had a bunch of spare EDTA a few months back? Who was it? Is there still any of it left?

After reading the service manual for my bike (Suzuki GS500E--1990) I have a couple of questions I hope you can answer:  When checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fill cap, does one check it with the cap screwed in or not?  I am more used to the dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully, wiped clean and reinserted fully, then withdrawn and read.  The dip stick on my bike is part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it.  Do I remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without screwing it down before reading?  The service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No. 1207B on the head cover.  I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material.  do you know of a generic (cheaper) substitute?  My headlight is a Halogen 60/55 W bulb.  Is there an easy, brighter replacement bulb available?  Where should I look for one?  As always, I very much appreciate your help.  The weather in Philadelphia has finally turned WARM.  This weekend I saw lotsa bikes, and the riders ALL waved.

This is   a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had   any problems with it.    It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than    a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better    suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non   competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.   You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear   changes.      The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike   very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a   custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect   the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced    by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up   by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better   ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.	0
 Tough question -- more dangerous than driving a car, and far more dangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the  activity.  Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is not unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective clothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong, you are likely to be less severely injured.  First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course, this will get you started on the right foot -- they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices.  Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy  piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking boots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay  tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the pants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable, preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for a jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand leather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.  Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after  drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions are such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding in the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly,  brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick, tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or otherwise not in average shape.  With care, you should be ok.   I would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard. Something in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If you are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as low as a 300-400 cc bike.  Possible models:  The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally inline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to  weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier  problems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.  The Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series I think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of standard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.  Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know them as well.  For mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to buy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective  clothing and insurance and licensing costs.	0
 If he had a history of such things, why was it not mentioned in the article, and why did they present the irrelevant detail of where he got his drinking money from?  I can't say exactly who is at fault here, but from where I sit is looks like we're seeing the results either of the law going way out of hand or of shoddy journalism.  If the law wants to attach strings to how you spend a settlement, they should put the money in trust.  They don't, so I would assume it's perfectly legitimate to drink it away, though I wouldn't spend it that way myself.	0
" (not that logic has anything to do with it, but...) I can see the liability of putting stickers on the car while it was moving, or something, but it's the BDI that chooses to start and then drive the car in a known unsafe condition that would (seem to be) liable. Furthermore, they would have had the last chance to avoid an unsafe situation, which is an additional factor in attributing ""blame"".

What a great day! Got back home last night from some fantastic skiing in Colorado, and put the battery back in the FXSTC. Cleaned the plugs, opened up the petcock, waited a minute, hit the starter, and bingo it started up like a charm! Spent a restless night anticipating the first ride du saison, and off I went this morning to get my state inspection done. Now my bike is stock (so far) except for HD slash-cut pipes, and all went well with my New Hampshire State Inspection (meaning all my lights worked OK) until the dude produces a decibel meter and tells me about the new NH law about MC noise.....huh?  sez I....and he has me start her up and rev to about 3000 rpm....I FAIL cuz I register 120 DB, and the max allowed is 110! If I fail with these pipes, there are gonna be a whole lotta seriously pissed off bikers round here when they go for inspection.  *&%^*$%*^*%*&  But hey, its a new experience! I have never really felt like a menace to society before! I parked, dismounted and walked in to my building with a slight swagger to my step, and a narrow lidded look... I sensed my faculty colleagues unease with my new intimidating status...and women's glances seemed to linger just a little longer....or perhaps that was my imagination.......*sigh*  Now I need to install my new BUB pipes and single fire ignition....I wonder how I will do after that!? 	0

 I'd bet the price of the helmet that it's okay...From 6 feet or higher, maybe not.   I'd wear the full facer, but then, I'd be *way* more worried about wind blast in the face, and inability to hear police sirens, than the helmet being a little damaged.    Well, my next helmet will be, subject to it fitting well, an AGV sukhoi. That's just because I like the looks. My current one is a Shoei task5, and it's getting a little old, and I crashed in it once a couple of years ago (no hard impact to head...My hip took care of that.). If price was a consideration I'd get a Kiwi k21, I hear they are both good and cheap.   Be *mildly* mildly paranoid about the helmet, but don't get carried away.

 I don't think this is the case, at least not on all jetskis.  On my friend's jetski, bars turn left to go left.  Anyway, all you're doing there is changing the yaw of the jets, so the relationship between the handlbars and the rear-mounted jets is completely arbitrary (simple linkage could make it work either way).   It seems to me that jetskis are even more irrelevant to this discussion than snow skis.  But it *has* been an amusing digression.

" Yep, that's pretty much it. I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the Jewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries fall, though.  As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was required, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).  The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between Man and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).   The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the ""created in His image"" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and have still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors unashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about Jesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians. Revelation aside, one can only ""know"" Christ second-hand or worse.  This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way initially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.   No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told the child that it is ""wrong"". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar (where there are no children). The ""wrongness"" here is if the child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is ""inappropriate"" to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of animals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but you get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.  David.  --- On religion:"	0

 Actually, they generally claim that (b) their particular interpretation of scripture/revelation *is* this objective morality.  That there are two conflicting versions of this objective morality does tell us something about (a).  It tells us at least one fake objective morality exists.  The next logical step is to deduce that any given religion's objective morality could be the fake one.  So caveat emptor.   mathew	0

  [...stiff deleted...]   [...stiff deleted...]  Speed is a quantifiable measure resulting from a set of methods that will result in the same value measured no matter the reference.

"I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead.  The FBI and the BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies.      Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as  a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.  They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet,  whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and  wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers. First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they didn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got it.  After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that. Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.  Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to them they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised Koresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                   The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he  ""A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out. His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise David Koresh.""  Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.  Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?  I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing.  That was the start of the ""Justification"" part part of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.  But, back to the plan.  It is considered ""Cruel and Unusal Punishment"" to execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.  They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not sure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the  compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.  I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR (Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical  agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.  I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of thing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.  We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these people 51 days.    I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks changed my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:  ""And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.""  It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.  One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises.                                                                 HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!  THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!  Still, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him. For all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy! I hope he gets it.                               "	0
"Mr DeCenso, in spite of requiring Scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas, rejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases those scholars opinion on the subject:   and    Actually, if you do further research as to the Greek word ""apacgw,"" you will find that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I recently checked several Lexicons:   ""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Louw and Nida  ""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament""  ""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Grimm  ""Word study Concordance,"" Tynsdale  ""A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other    early Christian Writings,"" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich  ""The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,"" Perschbacher  A couple simply stated ""hanged oneself"", and a couple were more explicit  and stated that ""apacgw"" means specifically ""kill yourself by hanging."" A couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for ""apacgw"" is ""strangle, throttle or choke"" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best references though, ""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give further context).    The word ""apagchw"" has two root words: ""gchw"" is the ""to strangle"" root, and the root word ""apo"" means literally ""away."" This root words is included in words which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the greek word ""apagello"" means to send a message).  ""Apo"" can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson specifically makes comparison to the word ""apokteiuo,"" which means ""to kill."" In literal meaning the word ""apacgw"" means ""to throttle, strangle to put out of the way,"" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from life, to death).  So while the word ""apacgw"" does mean ""to hang,"" it specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he state that it means ""to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging."" He then notes the the use of ""apacgw"" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He presents that example of ""apacgw"" as being used to explicitly mean ""suicide by hanging."" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the added denotation of ""death,"" and as you insist that the Bible was written by God, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete meaning of ""apacgw"" (ie: Since the word ""apacgw"" was used, then death is denoted as the result).   By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of ""apacgw"":   Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to Greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie"" the the Hebrew say ""and died""), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek.  It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added ""and died"", the correct translation would still be ""apacgw,"" as the man did indeed die from strangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing ""apacgw"" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence.   Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus, I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or historical source to justify it.   By the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:   Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago (after all, things change).   Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same as the 30 silvers:   True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal ""an iniquity,"" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas' actions ""an iniquity"" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took      ""Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling      him ""Buy what we need for the feast""; or that he should give something      to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and      it was night.""  Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived.   Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen evidence that ""apacgw"" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie: Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day.  Thus the money which bought the ""Field of Blood"" would have to have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver that night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I believe that the house of cards is comming down).   Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.  By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the mention of it in Matthew), you say:   I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse we are discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping  these issues.

"Tony-  I read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other typical""Christian"" anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and will con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may be unaware of all the statistica ""findings"" concerning African-Americans that have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias against African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances, but there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case. Fortunately African-Americans had ""whites"" who supported their 'cause' and public sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was even a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty much legal to discriminate against them.  I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something, that is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society, including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love, and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular to do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes in the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually sho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially within their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists against the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and treated as runaway slaves for being ""nigger-lovers"" and such.  I guess I've decided the challenge is worth it.  In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight who have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject their gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they began to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.  I'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values Coalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner support within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more oppressive legisation against gays.  Perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the Middle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and inquisitions.  The message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay rights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even hatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change the results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a ""conditional"" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an ""unconditional"" love, one that calls people ""just as they are.""  Sure there are things that will 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that need to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to ""other people's expectations."" In the process this coerced conformity causes many people a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper-spirituality.  This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with something very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation on thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation, but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society. Gay people are not criminals.  Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic church in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self- admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that was how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing happen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends recently told me he was ""approached"" by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.  These are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not the call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in Colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over Colorado called ""S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T."" (I forget the whole definition off hand, but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto is ""Working for a fag-free America"" with an implicit advocation for violence.  This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are embracing.  We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from organizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of excluding people.  The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to ""include"" people.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful, especially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto itself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?  Whatever"	0

From this fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with Catholic doctrine.  Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a love story between people of that faith, but a love story that is not exploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, pays proper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still erotic enough to have a place on a.s.s.  I would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, also most of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_.  I would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and increase the erotica. I actually agree with you that nearly all of the ""I've got an enormous dick, and I shot my wad all over her face"" stories are crap.

"    I'm sorry, I thought we were discussing heresy.  I assumed that heresy meant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is indeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word ""create"" is of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.     I should have said ""given the Mormon belief.""  If you disagree with the Mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important point.     Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by such terms.     It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they believe.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and Lucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or organized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being ""offspring"" of God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually ""born again"" of Him.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is how language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a word is dangerous.   <...>     On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.  You say that one must simply ""look at the Bible"" to see what it teaches, but centuries of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says. Are we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the scriptures?     Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief that Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same.  We keep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of Mormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)     On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great* importance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large number of Mormons."	0

 Yeah. Innocents. People who hoard $250K worth of high-caliber automatic weapons and kill law-enforcement agents really fit the bill here. The only innocents were the 20+ children who were prevented from leaving a burning building by their self-appointed messiah-following parents. A burning STARTED by the  Davidians.    Is this subject line a veiled threat against U.S. Government agents or possibly Executive office leadership (i.e. Clinton)? I've considered you a bit of a loon, before, Stephen, I guess this pretty much confirms it.   Nice religion you have there.  The only ones who should be killed are those who don't agree with us.

"In <lsjc8cINNmc1@saltillo.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu (Russell Turpin)   I regard love as no more or less ""benign"" than any other Christian does. You are merely expressing ""approval"" of the consequences I find therein. Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my (or any) religion.  ""Love"" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians can write both the ""gentle"" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in a passage that even the ""conservatives"" will quote at you :-) -- and the words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, ""Love is the unfamiliar Name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...""  This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise in my note, as will become more evident below.   blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though, given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of ""sin"" on another, and my unshakeable ""disestablishmentarianism"", Russel Turpin and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of Christian love.   You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) ""God"" in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:  The ""possibility that always exists"" is that I (or, to revert to proper time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could persuade ""Christian B"" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian] prohibitions.  What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:   A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved      in the Inquisition.   B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however      painful this *seems*, ""discipline"" her children for their      own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or      if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example      ""deterring"" others from the same loss-of-soul.)   A.  I point out that this ""justification"" of a failure in love      depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of      philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.   B.  Burns me at the stake.  My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is going on here has a *lot* to do with ""cultural baggage.""  In this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B.  Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B, then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what- ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney.  So, ""one possibility"" fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others.  At the other extreme, the ""persuasion"" will succeed when it properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have ""accepted"" that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.)  The point is that the ""persuasion"" breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the Inquisition, against ""heresy"", it is *bound* to break down in precisely the ""worst"" cases.  The ""conservative"" (I don't think that is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above, that he is ""justified"" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a ""greater good.""  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel, as if one's theories about ""sin"" entitled one to cast aside Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).  I am a ""radical"" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.   Well, the whole *point* of making these the ""base"" commandments is that they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  ""Conservatives"" may twist this ""act as if you were God"" to mean ""lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules."" They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation ""against God"" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the ""conservatives"" have confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.   And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* ""ethical systems"" (or in some cases, none).  As a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH. It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of ""commandments"" -- so little that the ""Christians"" who desperately *want* commandments go ""mining"" for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically ""gives"" as ""a commandment"" to us is ""love one another.""   [I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson   that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that   SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll   point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why   there is a huge amount of ""cultural baggage"" involved.]  You are quite right that this is ""goo"" if one is looking for an ethical system.  But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.   I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity? [Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]"	0
The Nicene Creed  WE BELIEVE in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, Very God of Very God, begotten not made, being of one substance with the Father by whom all things were made; who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate.  He suffered and was buried, and the third day rose again according to the Scriptur      es, and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father.  And he shall come again with glory to judge  both the quick and the dead, whose kingdom shall have no end.	0

"  Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by sentence.   1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.  Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of ""higher truth"" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither ""higher"" or  ""lower""; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  ""Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.""  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth."	0

"The following is an introduction as to who is Muhammad SAW as will be covered with this treatise.  MUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (SAW) is the last prophet of Islam.  He is the Prophet who is revealed the last Holy Scripture, Qur'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him) through the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets till the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between 571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW, is a treason against Islam, against Qur'an, against the message of Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another messenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah. He is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his coming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from  Chapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:   Muhammad is not the father of any of your men,  but (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal  of the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of  all things.  --------------------- Commentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed, it is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The  Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers. Allah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there has been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later ages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not an arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom, ""for Allah has full knowledge of all things.""  ---------------------- DROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2  A   D R O P L E T From The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur'an  Translations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of  Bediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor  VOL 1, No 11, Part 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------       NINETEENTH LETTER       MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI  (A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)         (continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)     SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW) declared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a decree as the Glorious Qur'an and manifest miracles which number, according to the scholars, one thousand. The occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as certain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In fact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate unbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise Our'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His miracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids)  sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their followers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the certainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars of Islam) to the hundreth degree.    The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of the universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the effect of the words,'You have indeed spoken the truth !'    Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler, while being observed by Him, 'The true ruler has appointed me to such and such position.  'At a time when you were asked to prove your claim, the word 'Yes' uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your request, this would confirm your claim even more soundly and more definitely than would the word 'Yes.'    In the same way, ALLAH's Most Noble Messenger claimed: 'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this universe.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken order at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my fingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five spigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He splits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear witness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at this food: although it is barely enough for two or three men, it satisfies two or three hundred.  'Further he shows hundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his prophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his deeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral conduct and manners, his character and appearance prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness. Indeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the famous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief merely by seeing him, and said, 'No lie can hide in this face, nor can any fraud be found in it!'    Although many of the  researchers have concluded that the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his miracles number about one thousand, there are thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of his prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of truth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of ways.    The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands of the proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty aspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a phenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of individuals who claimed prophethood and performed miracles have lived and passed away; then, the prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity superior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For whatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the means of the prophethood and messengership of all the messengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive fashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the person of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found in him with more certanity than all the other prophets. "	0
"Jesus:     Black and white.  A spade is a spade.  There is no hidden agenda behind this, so stop trying to look for one.   It is an easy and as straight forward as it reads.  Kent, I am not accusing you of evil things.  Jesus is accusing you. And it is not only you that He is accusing.  He is accusing everyone. Me, you and everyone in the world is guilty.  Whether one sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with  whether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.    Jesus uses the word ""men"".  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out. Jesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man. Christians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian  is just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian  can see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought out into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been exposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven't seen Jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't been exposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your own.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the Holy Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can shine light into places inside us where we didn't even know existed.   So do you see Jesus's point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians are not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the Light of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives, and they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far we have fallen from Jesus's perspective.  Do you think you want to know how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants to know?  Do you think I want to know?  Ego verses the truth, which do you choose?   And I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light,  who made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part of his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people who died with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was their downfall to death.   And Kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an excuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him. David Koresh was no light and no excuse for you to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who claimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh was born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn't even a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.  Jesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David Koresh wasn't anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be aware of imposters 2000 years ago.    So the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to be Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your mother's name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that simple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar right from the start.  The wouldn't have followed Koresh. They wouldn't have died.  But look what happened.  Their ignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant cost them a lot.  Kent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you not remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?   Did not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you remember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt Eve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded,  was the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus's case, Jesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It didn't work with Jesus.    Does what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan tried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what Koresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate? Who was Koresh's teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what Satan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did not Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did not the cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew the real Christ was born in Bethlehem?   Did not Eve choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil despite knowing that it would cause her death?  God held them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller.  None  of them had an excuse.  "	0
 As many people have mentioned, there is no reason why insurers could not offer a contract without abortion services for a different premium. The problem is that there is no guarantee that this premium would be lower for those who chose this type of contract.  Although you are removing one service, that may have feedbacks into other types of covered care which results in a net increase in actuarial costs.  For an illustrative example in the opposite direction, it may be possible to ADD services to an insurance contract and REDUCE the premium.  If you add preventative services and this reduces acute care use, then the total premium may fall.	0

"  Again, you missed Jesus's point.  If you read the surrounding passages you would understand what Jesus means by ""life in the world.""

Eternal life starts NOW--an infinitely high quality of life living in fellowship with God.    If my diety exists, you would not just cease to exist.  Jesus talks of hell in Luke 16:19-31.       The truth is, is that it is not some sort of magic spell.  The truth is is that you do not understand it, and enjoy not understanding it.    Wrong again.  Christianity is supposed to be relationship.  You do not even know what Christianity is and you are arguing against it. "	0
 Glad to hear this, just a note, Osiris, Mithras and many other cult gods resurrected as well, so there's a good chance for all of us to maybe end up in a virtual reality simulator, and live forever, hurrah!

"What are the consequences of the homophobic ranting of the self-righteous?  Well, I just noted this on another group, and thought I'd pass it along.  The context is talk.origins, and a report of yet another ""debate"" that was nothing but an attempt at mindless bullying and factless assertion by a standard-issue Creationist.

"Tony-  While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a ""good thing"" by posting that piece of propaganda, I believe the more people believe that the more they will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people.  I have seen the film called ""The Gay Agenda"" and along with my church we found it to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people are actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian Fundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list. I do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.  The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min- istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.  THE FOUNDER OF AN ""EX-GAY"" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO  by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)  In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians ""a way out of the homosexual death-style"" through prayer.  ""I'd like to give the award back,"" Caligiuri now laughs, ""I'm no longer deserve it.""   Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national ""ex-gay"" movement peaked with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex- gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  ""There's no reality in it,"" he says, ""I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.""   Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  ""We offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,"" explains Bob Davies, director of Exodus.  He ventures that ""about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo- sexuality are men.""   ""Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time,"" says Lisa Seeley, a former ""redeemed lesbian"" who worked with Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  ""These organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.""   ""It's possible to change your identity or your behavior,"" says sex educator Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. ""But it's really impossible to change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay, but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.""   Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted by a man he picked up in a bar.  ""I was really drunk,"" he recalls, ""and I went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all night, and the next morning he raped me again.""   When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the home he shared with his ex-lover.  ""He had another man there with him,"" Caligiuri recalls.  ""I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is about, I don't want to be this way anymore.""   Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance, Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed for hell.   Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  ""We were listed under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,"" Caligiuri says, ""so people thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out where the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo- sexuality.""  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says, adding, ""They'll do anything to reach these people.""   ""David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,"" recalls Peter Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, ""like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.""   Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on Raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  ""They were relieved,"" he recalls. ""They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better that I should be a 'reformed' gay person.""   But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  ""By the time I appeared on Sally's show,"" ""I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their father.  I was horny all the time.""   Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he ""used to go to bookstores and get blowjobs.""  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping with other ""reformed"" homosexuals.   ""I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex with one another,"" Caligiuri says.  ""We'd go to conferences in other cities, and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody else.""   By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988, Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's host asked him if he ever ""acted on temptation,"" his answer was a lie.   Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  ""I was too sick to go to church,"" he explains.  ""The more time I spent away from those people the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.""   Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministry's doors.  ""I'd convinced myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people,"" he says.   Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (""I'm interest- ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental.""), considering romance (""But not with a CHristian!""), and searching for a new project to devote himself to. ""I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,"" he says.  ""I want to eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I may have brought to our community.""  ---end article---  Caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some, like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian ""Lazarus Project"" of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as ""Love In Action"" and others, who either once claimed to have been ""reformed"" or who were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of ""sealing"" their new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous ""sin"" through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno- cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common- place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's _""Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as Maury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and self-acceptance."	0

" I assume you have evidence that he was responsible for the deaths?    Again, I'd like to see some evidence.    Once again, where's your proof? Suicide is considered a sin by Branch Davidians.  Also, Koresh said over and over again that he was not going to commit suicide.  Furthermore, all the cult experts said that he was not suicidal.  David Thibedeau (sp?), one of the cult members, said that the fire was started when one of the tanks spraying the tear gas into the facilities knocked over a lantern.    Evidence please?   I'd like to point out that the Bible says ""Do not commit murder."" The NKJ translation mistranslates.  Self-defense was never considered murder.  The reason why they were stockpiling weapons is because they were afraid the government would try something.  Their fears were obviously well founded. --Ray Cote"	0
 I'm curious about this statement, is it a known understanding amongst Christian believers that people who don't understand the Christian doctrines are enjoying this state?

" I agree, which is why I've asked for help with it.  The reason I'm working on this list is because I've recently had one too many Christians tell me ""the Bible contains no contradictions whatsoever.""  They believe that it's true, and that it describes reality perfectly, and even predicts history before it happens.  Before I can carry on any sort of meaningful conversation with these people, I've got to SHOW them, with concrete evidence, that the Bible is not nearly as airtight as they thought.  I hope to do that with this list.  Specifically: when I bring up the fact that Genesis contains two contradictory creation stories, I usually get blank stares or flat denials.  I've never had a fundamentalist acknowledge that there are indeed two different accounts of creation. "	0
" I became aware of the claim years ago.  So I decided to check it out, on my own.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some  references.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where  Lane Fox writes, ""... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus'  career] is agreed to be a Christian addition.""  In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21 April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine  Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  ""A comment *attributed* to Josephus reports ... [emphasis mine]"".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention the two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.  So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things:  1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the long passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory.  I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are orginally developed (does anyone?).  Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The former, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and ideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I  didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to incorporate theology).  Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before  Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one  hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any, because anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is  certainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have  the two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic  ms.  But here the ms. date is critical.  :-)"	0
Yes, that's true, but you have to be clear exactly what is an uninterpreted observation. It's pretty low level stuff. 'The sun shines' is already a LOT higher level than that. We can agree that 'I perceive brightness' perhaps.  Huh? What do you mean 'all in the same situation?' Let's take me and Dennis Kriz as examples. We're in pretty different situations, but I think we can agree as to whether it's day or night. I don't think we can agree as to whether or not abortion is morally acceptable. Yet we are certainly in the same difference of situations with respect to each other. Looks like weasel-words to me, Frank.   That's up to you, I guess.  This 'different situations' stuff is pretty confusing, Frank. How do we decide if we are in the same situation? You mind explaining?  Huh? I don't think so. I think that people disagree about fundamental goals.  -Ekr 	0

It is also none of your business.    Some people may also reason that by reading the bible and being a Xtian you are permanently damaging your brain.  By your logic, it would be OK for them to come into your home, take away your bible, and send you off to ""re-education camps"" to save your mind from ruin.  Are you ready for that?        /(hudson) /And why is there nothing wrong with it?  Because you say so?  Who gave you /the authority to say that, and set the standard for morality?  Why?  Because:  I am a living, thinking person able to make choices for myself. I do not ""need"" you to show me what you think is the way; I have observed too many errors in your thinking already to trust you to make up the rules for me.  Because: I set the standard for my *own* morality, and I permit you to do  the same for yourself.  I also do not try to force you to accept my rules.  Because: Simply because you don't like what other people are doing doesn't give you the right to stop it, Hudson.  We are all aware that you would like for  everyone to be like you.  However, it is obnoxious, arrogant thinking like  yours, the ""I-know-I'm-morally-right-so-I-can-force-it-on-you"" bullshit  that has brought us religious wars, pogroms against Jews, gay-bashing, and other atrocities by other people who, like you, ""knew"" they were morally right.      (me)  /(hudson) /Aren't you?  Aren't you indicating that I should not tell other people what to do?  Aren't you telling me it is wrong for me to do that?   It is not a moral standard that I am presenting you with, Hudson.  It is a key to getting along in life with other people.  It is also a point of respect:  I trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their own choices, and I expect the same to be returned.  You, on the other hand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whether they like it or not.  It is also a way to avoid an inconsistency:  if you believe that you have  the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives,  then you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of  interference in your life.   (Yes, I know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that only agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference. However, other people will say that you have misinterpreted the Word of God and that *they* are the actual true believers, and that you are acting on your own authority.  And so it goes).      (hudson) /Who gave /you the authority to set such a moral standard for me to tell me that I  /cannot set a moral standard for others?   You can set all the standards that you want, actually.  But don't be surprised if people don't follow you like rats after the Pied Piper.    At the most basic form, I am not going to LET you tell me what to do; and if necessary, I will beat you to a bloody pulp before I let you actually interfere in my life."	0

"  There were many injustices in the middle ages.  And this is truely sad. I would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchured them for practicing homosexuality, or any other crime.  The church is not called to take over the governments of the world.  It may be that homosexuals treated cruelly today, but that does not mean that we should teach  Christians to practice homosexual immorality.  Do you think that we should also teach Christians to practice divination and channelling because the witches in the middle ages were persecuted.    And you accuse me of judging?  When did you look into my heart and see if I have love.  I have been writing that we should not teach Christians to practice homosexual immorality, and you pretend to have divine knowledge to look into my heart.  I can't say that I love homosexuals as I should- I can't say that I love my neighbor as I should either.  I don't know very many homosexuals as it is.    But Jesus loves homosexuals, just as He loves everyone else.  If His love were conditional, I not know Him at all.  Yes.  We should show love to  homosexuals, but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to  stumble and continue in their sin.  That is a very damaging and dangerous  thing.   That is slander.   I could just as easily say  that NAMBLA has been able to implement legislation to make child molesting easier because of the tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexuality as normal, and that this is what you are embracing.  I do believe that homosexual sex is immoral, that does not mean I endorse using violence against them.  There is a problem of hatred in the church.  But there is also the problem of what has been called ""unsanctified mercy."" Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in  this country and the storm on the horizon, and have gotten militant in  the flesh.  This is truely sad.  Yet others in other churches have  embraced immorality in society, and have pointed to the carnality in the conservative churches to justify their actions.     Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus. But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in.  Jesus didn't go out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects to draw people in.  He told one man to sell all He had.  He told another not to say good bye to His family.  His words were hard at times. We should present people with the cost of the tower before we allow them to begin construction.  many people have already been innoculated to the gospel.  Link Hudson.

The Bible indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they ""belong to"" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have rebelled against God, and are not ""children (=followers/redeemed) of God,"" but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of salvation.  # #        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the #        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked ""one""; #        (Matthew 13:38)  kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus (and have shown ""works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.  The issue of satan's spirit-origin (and of those who followed him) has not been addressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible.  You purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your ""right"" with non- related scriptures.  (...lots of nice scriptures deleted (NOT Robert W. copyrighted) though...)  #ra> > We are told that, ""And this is life eternal, that they might know #ra> > thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."" #ra> > (John 17:3). Life eternal is to know the only true God. Yet the #ra> > doctrines of the LDS that I have mentioned portray a vastly #ra> > different Jesus, a Jesus that cannot be reconciled with the Jesus of #ra> > the Bible. They are so far removed from each other that to proclaim  Correction: ""my"" Jesus is indeed different than your Jesus, and CAN be reconciled with the Jesus in the Bible.  --Not your interpretation of Him, I concur, but I honestly couldn't care less.  #ra> > one as being true denies the other from being true. According to the #ra> > Bible, eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true God, and #ra> > not the construct of imagination.  In this single posting of yours, I've seen more ""constructs of imagination"" than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news group.  First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us about ""the only true God,"" whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about Him myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.  #  This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but #  rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read #  something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches.  Sigh.  ""What the Bible teaches""?  Or: ""what the bible teaches according to Robert Weiss and co.?""  I respect the former, I reject the latter without the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by the way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you being a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a Christian (following my own image of Him in my heart).  (...)  #  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of #  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't #  think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the #  issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this #  subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may #  certainly be.  The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of ""official doctrine"" is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial (e.g. ""The Seven Deadly Heresies"" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best, or erroneous at worst (""blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation"").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book ""Mormon Doctrine"" is oftentimes referred to as ""McConkie's Bible"" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen.  I'm somewhat appalled that I have allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting...  ============================= Robert Weiss psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu "	0
"I recently read an article in a local paper written by an Islamic   person who was upset with the way Islam has been portrayed by western media.   When a terrorist action takes place in the middle east, it is always played   up as an Islamic Terrorist.  However, when the a Serbian terrorist attacks   the Croations, its not a Christian terrorist, its just a terrorist.  I have often tried to explain this to some close friends who believe   the press, that Islam is somehow tied to violence.  Often times you hear   things like ""They just don't value human life like we do..."" and so on.   I was wondering if anyone out there had any suggestions for how we can   change this image, or how I can help my friends to see that this is just    hype.  I would appreciate any serious suggestions or comments via e-mail,   and I'm not interested in hearing about how right the press is."	0
: I will clarify my earlier quote.  God's laws were originally written for  : the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to : all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of : Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made : obsolete by Jesus.  Just for reference, here's the earlier quote: Malcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9 and Deuteronomy 22:20-25: : These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had : expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a : direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God : is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately : punishable. : Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to : God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in : the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There : is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And : not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew : and Gentile alike.  These are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the other is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on an issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change was made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus change that?  : If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the : following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon : the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  Sure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning non-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to deny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?  : I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of : modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe : in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  I'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible from end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this knowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and back it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David Koresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if they actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly made the means look frightening.  However, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but believe every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far more of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough to debate with these people.  : Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's : perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.  No, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told me how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will by doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to two millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it with my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing the will of God.  : Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is : their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.  Well, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about eternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from the god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.  : God be with you,  Not yours, thanks ;)  : Malcolm Lee  :)  Rob Lanphier lanphi872@snake.cs.uidaho.edu lanph872@uidaho.edu  And for the curious, here is my earlier post:	0
"/(hudson) /Yes you do.  Who is to say that it is immoral for onesself to experience /pain or to be hurt in some other way.  Maybe unpleasant, but that doesn't /say anything about morality.  It violates free will, Hudson.    (me)  /(hudson) /Why is making someone a less productive member of society immoral?  Hudson, you are screwing up again.  Morality does not (I say again, DOES NOT) define only ""right and wrong"".  It also defines ""acceptable social behavior"", without any overtones of good and evil.  Picking up your trash is not really a right/wrong moral issue in the eternal sense of Good and Evil.  Yet it is moral in the sense that it is acceptable social behavior"".    Your definition of the word ""morality"" is what is causing you to trip over  yourself here.     /(me) /And since />I, selfish being that I am, want to maximize my gains from society, I will />not do anything to another member of society if that action might cut down />on how much benefit I can derive from society.  /(hudson) /Why is your benefit somehow related to morality.  Again, your definition is causing you to shoot yourself in the foot.      /(hudson) /What about if someone feels that their own personal benefit is enhanced /more than it would be damaged by depleting the overall resources of society? /Maybe something might hurt society, but it would help him immensly?  That is irrational thinking.    There may also be people out there who think that death by atomic  destruction is  a sublime and wonderful thing. I am not going to let them execute that idea just because they want to do it.   Simply because I let people make up their minds about what morals they have doesn't prevent me from spotting and stopping a madman when I see one, Hudson.  And even then, I will only stop him when he interferes  with me and my life.  That is the difference between me and you:  you want to interfere in people's lives even when they aren't affecting you.        /(hudson) /The central character in Dostoevsky's novel, Crime and Punishment,  /(R something or other) reasoned that if killed this old Jewish woman and /stole her money to educate and establish himself financially, he could /make a great contribution to society.  He reasoned that she was not of  /much profit to society.  She just collected rents, and hoarded money.   One of the central points of any (that's ANY) moral system is that is has to be internally consistent.    By killing her, the character had to accept the premise that the ends justify the means.  If he accepted that premise, then (in order to be consistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may apply the same standard to HIS life.  Now, if he is unwilling to accept this premise (which he will not be willing to accept), then he has behaved inconsistently with his own moral standard.      /(me) /[football example deleted]  /(hudson) /Now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the /players in the field/on the court is injured (or killed.)  This freshman /wants to play in the big game so a talent scout can see him.  If he hurts /a player on the team, it might slightly lessen the chances of the team to /win, but he might gain great personal benefit.  So, operating on purely /selfish (immorally selfish) motives, he arranges for a sniper to shoot a /team player in the leg.  He gets to play in front of the talent scout.  /Did that freshman behave morally?  /Selfish intentions may sometimes generate (apparently) moral actions, but /not always.    Two problems right off the bat:  1.  The problem with your analogy is that it doesn't address the goal that I started with:  winning the game.  Playing in front of the talent scout != winning the game.  Try creating the same analogy and keep the ultimate goal the same, will you?"	0

"Robert, you keep making references to ""orthodox"" belief, and saying things like ""it is held that..."" (cf. ""Kermit"" thread).  On what exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call ""orthodox?""  Who is that ""holds that"" Luke meant what you said he meant?  Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to ""look at the Bible"" in order to see the truth, but what of those who see Biblical things differently from you?

If you would prefer to have it all housed in a normal arcade cabinet this can be done as well.  The graphics will go nicely along the sides and front of the cabinet.       Everything works perfectly.  The laserdisc player has an RS-232 port which you can use to develop your own multimedia type applications.  The Laserdiscs have been stored in a safe place and have no scratches on them.       If you are interested please email me.

Forsale:  Proton P1100 preamplifier ========================= About 3.5 years old, originally $299, asking $150 or best offer.  Has inputs for tape 1, tape 2, CD, phono, video and tuner. Separate listen and record selectors.  Bass EQ, subharmonic filter and mono switch.  High quality volume potentiometer.  In excellent condition, with original boxes and manual.  Sony D-88 portable Diskman ========================== This is the one designed to play the mini CD's. You can play normal size CDs, but the disk sticks out the side.  Works well, but may skip occasionally - it should be tuned up (heads aligned, cleaned, etc.)  In excellent condition.  It has not been used all that much.  With carrying case.  Original list was (I think) $300, but I'll take $80 or best offer.  It would be good for an office or just to sit on your desk.  Please email me <eric@enterprise.bih.harvard.edu> or telephone at (617) 278-0068.  Eric	0

Hi, everyone;   I need an advice on what is the best way to get a scumster.  Several weeks ago I posted an article on behalf of a friend who wanted an external HD for mac. The scumster - R.E.P. - called my friend and they agreed on a price. My friend (unexperienced and not too fluent in English) paid by check, requesting R.E.P. to call him back when the check arrives and the HD is send. Well, the check was cashed 3/24 and that is that. Phone # that R.E.P. gave is on the answering machine all the time and there is no reaction when the message is left; e-mail address does not bounce but again there is no answer. I know, that R.E.P. is a student at University of Delaware; I have his e-mail address, his US postal address and his (?) phone#. The question is: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED?  Thanks in advance for any advice.  Sincerely, Victor Levenson (VVL2H@virginia.edu)  P.S. The reason I did not put R.E.P.'s full name is that I still hope...   P.P.S. If I get enough responses I will post a summary, maybe even on a regular basis.  VL -- ====================================	0

There are many people want to buy my Kodak autofocus carousel projectors but I don't have lenses or remote to sell.  They prefer to buy a projector with all accessaries.  So I have to post another news asking for lenses to fit those Kodak slide projectors:  I am willing to give away Singer Caramate II or Singer Caramete SP ( w/ built-in unremovable lens, built-in casette player, speaker, new 500 HR bulb) try to trade for Kodak projector lenses.  Each projector (viewer) will equal trade for 1 or 2 Kodak projector lenses depend on the focal length.  I will pay for the shipping for Singer  projector (viewer).  Since I don't need those Singer projectors, if you have some 35mm SLR system you don't need, I am willing to do the trade as well.	0

"********************[ PC Game For Sale ]******************  Waxworks by Horrorsoft/Accolade (5.25"")     $30  By the same folks who brought you Elvira I & II.  I played Elvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made a very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is roughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time fighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games, especially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This  is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is quite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found that is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting strategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is  no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain moderately challanging puzzles.  The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really  broken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits you must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported with no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps you inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must  escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines and pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant zombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue some humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is perhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into Jack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper victim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and  meet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to  stop the almost indestructible zombies.    Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a  creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game. I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.     *********************************************************  - All prices include shipping. - All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated. - US buyers only please. - All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,   priority USPS. - All games include all original materials including box, manual,   disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.

I have a 24-pin printer which is an ALPs Allegro24.  It's both a fast printer with LQ and a very sophisticated design.  It has a straight paper path and the capability of auto-forwarding sheets to tear off and then back (a big paper saver as you never have to waste sheets to get a current print out).  It can also handle single sheets without removing the formfeed and has sophisticated preferences options (you can interactively program all the preferences to control the printer and get printed feedback without ever using a computer).  You get prompts and menus to pick your current setup and default set up.  This was THE top of the line LQ dot matrix when I bought it three years ago for $399.  It is also Epson LQ2500 compatible (besides it's own modes) and comes with IBM driver software (which I've never used since I own an Amiga).  Has a card slot for upgrading memory or fonts.

"  ^^^^^^^^  Well, I'm not sure I'd go quite that far, but I agree that Motorola gear is of better quality.  The question is how much that quality is worth to a ham in amateur service, not commercial service   Ok, great. But how often does that come up?  How good is ""good enough"", and how much is someone willing to pay for it? A good ham-quality HT is maybe $500, while a commercial quality one is maybe $2000. Is the increased reliability and performance worth 4 times the price *in amateur service*? Only the individual involved can answer that question, and each ham has to decide for him/herself.  If Motorola quality is worth 4 times the price to you, then more power to ya'. But I'm amazed that folks make that choice. For, me, given that I've got $2000 to spend, I'l pick the Yaesu ht and a nice new HF rig every time over a Motorola ht alone, no matter how good it is.  To me, ham-quality gear is ""good enough"".

I have an old Optonica tuner and integrated amp that I no longer use.  The integrated amp section does not work right now but should not cost much to fix.  I believe that it is just a Chip.  I have  used it as a preamp and it works great!  This is a very nice looking and well built set.  They both are low  profile but the amp is rather heavy.  The tuner is in fine working condition and is a match to the amp.  The amp is rated at 75w/ch.  These peices went for about $850 New.  I would like to get $150.  obo  for the pair.   If anybody has knowledge anough to fix the amp, I have had an estimate done that it should cost less than $50 in parts.  Please email me if you are interested.  I will be moving back home for the summer and will sell it back there if I do not do so here.  Todd 	0

 I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part about the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead that the important part of what the original poster said was the bit about killing Palestinians.  In retrospect, I can see how the sightseeing thing would be offensive to many.  I originally saw it just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others might see it differently.  I still think that Ken came on a bit strong though.  I also think that your advice to Masud Khan:    #Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee, it's a good idea to   #do a little homework, or at least think.  was unnecessary.   Throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual anti-semitism.  If I agreed with that, then maybe your speech on why this is bad might have been relevant.  But I think you're reading a lot into one flip sentence.  While probably not true in this case, too often the charge of anti-semitism gets thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the state of Israel.  Anyway, I'd rather be somewhere else, so I'm outta this thread.	0
    (Deletion)     You have given that example. It is not lenient. End of argument.   And chopping off the hands or heads of people is not lenient either. It rather appears that you are internalized the claims about the legal system without checking if they suit the description.   And wasn't the argument that it takes five men to rape a woman according to Islamic law?       No, I even believe what I don't like. Can you give better answers than that? Have you got any evidence for your probably opposite claims?       A fact, if memory serves. And most will see the connection between the primitive machism in the Orient and in Islam.     As usually you miss the point. Aids is  neither spread only through sex nor necessarily spread by having sex. Futher, the point is, a very important point, the urge for sex is stronger than the fear of AIDS. It is even stronger than the religious attempts to channel or to forbid sex. The consequences of suppressing sex are worse than the consequences of Aids. Please note that the idea that everybody would end up with AIDS when sex is not controlled is completely counterfactual.  	0

 Actually, the story goes that Lucifer refused to bow before MAN as  God commanded him to.  Lucifer was devoted to God.  Oh yeah, there is nothing in Genesis that says the snake was anything more than a snake (well, a talking one...had legs at the time, too).  I don't think pointing out contradictions in STORIES is the best way to show the error in theology:  if they think a supernatural entity kicked the first humans out of paradise because they bit into a fruit that gave them special powers...well, they might not respond well to reason and logic.  :^)	0
"Archive-name: atheism/logic Alt-atheism-archive-name: logic Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.4                         Constructing a Logical Argument  Although there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument found is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.  Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument.  Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job.  Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, ""It is raining"" or ""Today is Tuesday"".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning of ""deny"", not the everyday meaning.  The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular arrangement of words used to express it.  So ""God exists"" and ""There exists a God"" both express the same proposition.  An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, ""a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition"".  An argument consists of three stages.  First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions.   Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as ""because"", ""since"", ""obviously"" and so on.  (The phrase ""obviously"" is often viewed with suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to question it.  You can always say ""Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious"" when you've heard the explanation.)  Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of valid inference.  The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as ""implies that"" or ""therefore"".  Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as ""therefore"", ""it follows that"", ""we conclude"" and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.  For example:  Every event has a cause (premise) The universe has a beginning (premise) All beginnings involve an event (premise) This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference) Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)  Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.  Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example, the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated  afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if  sometimes a little confusing.  Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:  ""If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,  or the Son of God.""  This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its  conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll come to those later.)  Another example:  ""God created you; therefore do your duty to God.""  The phrase ""do your duty to God"" is not a proposition, since it is neither true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an argument.  Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form ""A because B"".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the statement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then it is not an argument, it is an explanation.  For example:  ""There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not  start."" -- This is an argument.  ""My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.""  -- This is an explanation.  There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions -- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.  An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid; however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments, and about how probable their premises are.  There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.  It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly  counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more carefully.  Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions.  For example:     All insects have wings (premise)    Woodlice are insects (premise)    Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)  Here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false.  If the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true.  The argument is thus entirely valid.  More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises, as in:     All fish live in the sea (premise)    Dolphins are fish (premise)    Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)  However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a ""truth table"" for implication.  The symbol ""=>"" denotes implication; ""A"" is the premise, ""B"" the conclusion.  ""T"" and ""F"" represent true and false respectively.  Premise Conclusion Inference    A        B        A=>B ----------------------------    F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference    F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.     T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion                              false, the inference must be invalid.     T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,                              the conclusion must be true.  A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound  argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments.  To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.  In everyday English the term ""fallacy"" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or convincing.  So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive.  ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)  The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as ""might makes right"".  The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.  For example: ""... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.""  ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  Argumentum ad hominem is literally ""argument directed at the man"".  The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.  For example: ""Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.""  Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by  showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).  The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent's particular circumstances.  For example: ""It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?""  This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent's argument.  This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For  example:  ""Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing.  You're white.""  This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is also known as ""poisoning the well"".  ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM  Argumentum ad ignorantium means ""argument from ignorance"".  This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true, a basic scientific principle.)  Examples: ""Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.""  ""Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has shown any proof that they are real.""  Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can  validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:  ""A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water, even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no such flood occurred.""  In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred, however.  ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM  This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is  committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a  conclusion accepted.  For example:  ""I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me guilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan.""  ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM  This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language.  For example:  ""Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.""  ""The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?""  ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM  This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more likely it is that that proposition is correct.  ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM  The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion.  For example:  ""Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.""  This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly between:  ""Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation"" and ""John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent  computer""  Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable  whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.  THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT  The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose ""accidental"" circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific.  For example:  ""Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must dislike atheists.""  This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.  CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION  This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases.  For example: ""Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are insincere.""  SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER  A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization.  NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  These are known as False Cause fallacies.  The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For  example:  ""I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God cured me of the headache.""  The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For  example:  ""The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons.""  CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.  PETITIO PRINCIPII  This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached.  CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO  This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:  ""Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job.  Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office.""  Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the  conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees.  Another example is the classic:  ""We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God.""  COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION  This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded  question:  ""Have you stopped beating your wife?""  The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination, when they ask questions like:  ""Where did you hide the money you stole?""  Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:  ""How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?"" or ""Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?""  IGNORATIO ELENCHI  The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument  supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion.  For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.  Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light.  EQUIVOCATION  Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument.  For example:  ""What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.""  AMPHIBOLY  Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.  ACCENT  Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case, the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized.  For example, consider:  ""We should not speak ILL of our friends"" and ""We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS""  FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION  One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole.  For example:  ""The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very  lightweight.""  The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:  ""A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses.""  FALLACY OF DIVISION  The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like its opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:  ""You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.""  The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item.  For example:  ""Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.""  THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT  This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event.  For example: ""If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana.""  ""A IS BASED ON B"" FALLACIES / ""IS A TYPE OF"" FALLACIES  These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.  Examples: ""Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of history?""  ""Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a form of Christianity?""  ""Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?""  AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form ""A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true"".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for implication given earlier.  DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form ""A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false"".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy.  Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has the form ""A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false"", where A does NOT in fact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B.  CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL  This fallacy is an argument of the form ""If A then B, therefore if B then A"".  ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM  This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old, or because ""that's the way it's always been.""  ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM  This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else.  ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM  The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those with more money are more likely to be right.  ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM  The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam.  ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM  This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard.  An ""argumentum ad nauseum"" is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something.  BIFURCATION  Also referred to as the ""black and white"" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist.  PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS  This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question.  NON SEQUITUR  A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it.  RED HERRING  This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the points being made, towards a different conclusion.  REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION  Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.  SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF  The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.  STRAW MAN  The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position, then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made.  THE EXTENDED ANALOGY  The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a  claim that those situations are analogous to each other.  This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about  anti-cryptography legislation:  ""I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.""  ""Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported  Martin Luther King.""  ""Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the  struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!""  TU QUOQUE  This is the famous ""you too"" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:  ""You're just being randomly abusive."" ""So?  You've been abusive too."""	0
  I agree, I reckon it's television and the increase in fundamentalism.. You think its the increase in pre-marital sex... others thinks its because psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent criminals con them into letting them out into the streets... others think it's the increase in designer drugs... others think it's a communist plot. Basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society are far too complicated for us to control. We just have to hold on to the panic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing. But one things for sure, depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not due solely to sex out of marriage.  Jeff. 	0

"  Well, I've said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is objectively a murder.  However, who is at blame is another question. It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions-- realizing the risks--is to blame.   Yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this.   And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact, many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents.   But, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals on the road.  Again, the blame is on society.   Yes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses.   Okay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not all such ""murders"" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?   But, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of society shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an execution, is it?   Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is.   Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.   But then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the conviction was unfair.   Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible, but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.   But what we know has no effect on an objective system.   Why are you so sure?   Why is *your* reality important?   But, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely. And, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system.   Well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal. We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible.   Yes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.   We must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack?   I don't think our country has an objective system, but I think such an objective system can exist, in theory.  Without omniscience, an objective system is not possible in practice."	0
  I have never been to Wisconsin, though I have been to neighbor Minnesota. Being a child of the Middle Atlantic (NY, NJ, PA) I found that there were few states in the provences that stood out in this youngster's mind: California, Texas, and Florida to  name the most obvious three.  However, both Minnesota and Wisconsin stuck out, solely on the basis of their politics.  Both have  always translated to extremely liberal and progressive states. And my recent trip to Minnestoa last summer served to support that state's reputation.  My guess is that Wisconsin is probably the same.  At least that was the impression the people of Minnesota left with me about their neighbors.  The only question in my head about Wisconsin, though, is  whether or not there is a cause-effect relationship between cheese and serial killers :)	0

"The recent rise of nostalgia in this group, combined with the   incredible level of utter bullshit, has prompted me to comb   through my archives and pull out some of ""The Best of Alt.Atheism""   for your reading pleasure.  I'll post a couple of these a day   unless group concensus demands that I stop, or I run out of good   material.    I haven't been particularly careful in the past about saving   attributions.  I think the following comes from John A. Johnson,   but someone correct me if I'm wrong.  This is probably the longest   of my entire collection.  ________________________________________________________                                     So that the                                   Prophecy be                                    Fulfilled                                       * * *         In considering the Christian religion, and judging it according to its claims, it is important to look at its claims at fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy.  The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main strategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even about the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in the New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at least 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much happened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we will take particular claims at face value.  Immanuel:         We begin, of course, at the beginning.         (Mt 1.21-22):  ""[Mary] will bear a son, and you,        Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is        salvation), for he will save his people from their        sins.""  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had        spoken by a prophet:         [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),        king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made        war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not        quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz        and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its        heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the        lord G'd said to Isaiah, ""go to meet with Ahaz...""         ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,        naturally) saying, ""Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It        can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.""  But,        Ahaz said, ""I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a        test.""  Then (Isaiah) said, ""Hear then, O house of        David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that        you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord        himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman        is with child and will bear a son, and name him        ""Immanuel,"" which means, ""G'd is with us.""   He will        eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil        and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to        refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings        you dread will have been deserted...  Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics.  Further, he the Hebrew word ""almah,"" (young woman), as specifically, ""virgin.""  But, this is not a prophecy about the Messiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years later.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In short, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of context, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary, virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course, the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by later Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by the name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy for Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second class prophecy.   Not too convincing.  Egypt:         After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he wishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.         [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of        Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:        ""Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.""   What the lord really said was this.         [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him.         And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called        them (my people), the more they went from me; they        kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning        incense to idols.  Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it was indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to return.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of here.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.  Rachel Weeps:          While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that King Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of all young male children.  Matthew then writes,         [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the        prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:         ""A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud        lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;        she refused to be consoled, because they were        no more.""     The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722 BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim, and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are ""no more.""  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.        It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who was the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and Bethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her ""children,"" it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city, ""on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).""        As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible, nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time.  Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a prime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance the message of the church's gospel.        Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus. It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The ""children"" the prophet speaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd comforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be returned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this would not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are dead for good.  Again, the ""prophecy"" Matthew sets up is not even that, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too convincing.  The Nazarene:         We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth,          [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets        might be fulfilled, ""He shall be called a Nazarene.""  First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of the prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who ""He"" is.  There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse, there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still worse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at all.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that she will,         [Judges 13.5]  ""...conceive and bear a son.  No razor        shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his        god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel        from the hands of the Philistines.""  This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd.  But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is simple making them up now.  Bearing our Diseases:         Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities.         [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the        prophet Isaiah, ""He took our infirmities and bore our        diseases.""  As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context, and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,         [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has        borne our sickness, and carried our pains.  From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the Israelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish identity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the instrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.       The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline.  They do not speak of a ""servant"" going around and healing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus, as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but rather something that had already happened.  While it is believed that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear the illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say that, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his spiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect.   Silent Messiah:        Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus ordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse the attention of the local rulers.         [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by        the prophet Isaiah.            ""Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,        with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on        him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He        will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear        his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised        reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings        justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his        name.""  The Isaiah passage quoted reads,         [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my        chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my        spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the        nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or        make it heard in the street.  He will not break a        bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will        faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail        (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has        established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands        await his law.  You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage, because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could never think of Jesus failing, never would the ""light"" of mankind burn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace G'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will be the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed from the Judaic ""...the coastlands await his law."" to the Christologic, ""the Gentiles will hope in his name.""   While the original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of ""believing in the name.""  If one has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only to read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant, ""a people robbed and plundered...""   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at ""prophecy"" is examined, it crumbles.  Three Days and Three Nights:        Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection.         [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the        whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son        of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and        three nights.  Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know how the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was 24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset 6pm.  What was referred to as a ""day"" was the period of light from 6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time scale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until 6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays.  (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus, when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus, Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights.        As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the ""ninth hour,"" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the grave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, ""rose,"" before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was over).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for clarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before 6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm Friday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two nights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this is a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to suspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little mistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his god's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more than unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.  Hearing & Understanding:       Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if you were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the message of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand them, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not accept the ""plain"" message any better.  Matthew says,         [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in        fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says,          ""You will indeed hear but never understand; and you        will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this        people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of        hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they        would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and        understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal        them.""  The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his call to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is flourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria.  Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd, calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.         [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, ""Go, and say to this        people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and        see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this        people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their        eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear        with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and        turn and be healed.""  Then Isaiah said, ""How long,        lord?""  And he said, ""Until the cities lie waste        without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the        land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far        away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And        though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned        again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still        stands when the tree is felled."" The holy seed is its        stump.  Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel to stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the promise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read the rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look at Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)      We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion of Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that, he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't understand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are not prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the present.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face.        Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they have the prophetic approval.         [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a        parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the        prophet, ""I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I        will utter that which has been hidden since the        foundation of the world.""  Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a prophet, but from the Psalms.         [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will        utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have        heard and known, things that our fathers have told us.         We will not hide them from their children, but tell to        the coming generation the glorious deeds of the        lord...  As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come from a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies of Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet.  Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up.      Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once again, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus has said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden.  Further, they speak of things ""known, that our fathers have told us.""  Jesus deals with things ""hidden since the foundation of the world.""  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion.  This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No wonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again, Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But, Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.   Excuses of Little Faith:         In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what epilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were unable to ""dispossess"" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more enlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying they didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this demon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move mountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can move real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to Mexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old woman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.         And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in heaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.         Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time or a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see God anymore.         We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're        sinful; it's just his ""plan""; we put too many of our        own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right        faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...       Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear reader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be true. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your heart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say our little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they say, ""See the love in these people you worship with... see the lives of people change... that is seeing G'd.""   Thus people get lulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday sights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is not seeing G'd the way people used to see.         What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of human hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created by the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are what we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith.  Jesus Rides on an Ass:         Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah king, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into Jerusalem.           [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken        by the prophet, saying,         Tell the daughter of Zion, ""Behold, your king is        coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a        ass-colt.""  Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little differently.         Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and        victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-        colt... he will command peace to the nations.  There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah only involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological, proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written earlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to Jesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has bungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses, the situation is often reversed nowadays...         Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But, Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,         [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of        babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'  It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus was never one to point out such little ""prophetic"" things AND since, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to fit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or Matthew, ""Haven't you read?"" for the source reads,         [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is        your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is        chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you        have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the        enemy and the avenger.  The passages hardly need comment.  There is no ""perfect praise"" spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd, not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be just one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic scripture.  YHVH said to  my lord...:        Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish messiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king David.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,         ""The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until        I put your enemies under your feet.""  Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic descent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of course, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to make some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation.  But, there are problems.        In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the messiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king, bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's rule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the Christians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this psalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had also made.  One must remember that there were various factions among the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the messiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like his audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and who interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic. What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,         YHVH's utterance to my lord:  ""Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your        footstool.""         YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule        in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer        themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the        holy mountains.           ""You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek        forever.""  The word ""lord"" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the word is ""adoni,"" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means ""lord,"" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an address of respect.         There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is supposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the psalm translates to either ""a psalm of David,"" or ""a psalm about David.""  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the psalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended from David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive tales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any praises of a messiah.      Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after David was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of favour for David's kingdom on hold.        The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was promised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies, successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king, enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.       We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone, though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though his use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this event is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off a little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note, though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd.  Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of an infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we might expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.  Moses & Jesus, Had it Together All Along...:         We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John deserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew.  But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah king, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this was accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the promise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.         [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,        rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.  It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but, Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian.  I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the course to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like his forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they still cling to it.  The Potter's Field:        We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,         [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver        in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief        priests, taking the silver, said, ""It isn't lawful for        us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood        money.""  So they... bought a potter's field with it to        bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was        spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,         ""And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price        of him on whom a price had been set by some of the        sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's        field, as the lord directed me.""  This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Scripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which Matthew makes use of.         [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,        thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, ""Cast        them to the treasury,"" --the lordly price at which I        was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of        silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of        YHVH.  First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely a priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one another.  The word, ""treasury,"" had been replaced by the King James Scholars with ""to the potter,"" precisely because this made Matthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed ""treasury,"" which also makes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas ""potter's field"" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given Matthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty.       Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the text.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if as most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to toss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high priests.  The high priests would not put the money in the treasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the opposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student, the ""prophecy"" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New Testament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing enough.  Wine, Vinegar, & Casting Lots:        Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.         [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,        mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not        drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they        divided his garments among them by casting lots: that        it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,         ""They parted my garments among them, and upon my        vesture did they cast lots.""  First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour wine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find that right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him some to drink --not polluted with gall.         [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, ""I thirst.""  A bowl of        vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the        vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he        had received the vinegar, he said, ""It is finished;""  But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the prophets, but one from the Psalms.         [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;        and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me        poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and        for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add        to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no        acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the        Book of the Living.  Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request of drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm quoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It is not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the ""Jesus"" in the psalm asks G'd for the damnation of the ""crucifiers,"" whereas the Jesus of the gospels says,         [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, the        don't know what they do!""  Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his meat, as the psalm stipulates.         With the ""prophecy"" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally ask, ""What of the casting of lots?""  This brings up the 22nd Psalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no great thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of Jesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions, his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions.  The 22nd Psalm:        This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We will examine the primary passages.         Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?!         Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words        of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you        don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.  Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross.  This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather than king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like ""the lamb led mute before its shearers.""  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much groaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross.         6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men...         All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag        their heads;  ""He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let        him deliver him... for he delights in him.""  This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.         12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their        mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.         16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of        evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and        feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my        garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.         19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my        soul from the sword, my life from the power of the        dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my        afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!  It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately, this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words ""have pierced"" really do not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,         16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of        evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my        hands and feet...  In Hebrew the phrase ""like the lion"" and a very rare verb form which can mean ""pierced"" differ by one phonetic character.  The word in the Hebrew text is literally, ""like the lion"" (ka'ari), which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to ""ka'aru.""   But, to add the needed (yet artificial) weight to the ""prophecy"" this is just what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to Jesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators.         Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend itself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the psalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather the forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.        Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord Jesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian theology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful fundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might have been ""enhanced"" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But, it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good things for St. Matthew.  The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's crucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after the fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,         [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his        side with a spear, and out came blood and water...        these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...        ""The will look on him whom they've pierced.""  Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with them.         [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...        And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations        that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will        pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on        Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have        pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him        like you weep over a firstborn child.  John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that Matthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more than just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and blatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel writers, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded.   Reckoned with Transgressors:         After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming the Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of the gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.         [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,        one on his right, one on his left.  And so the        scripture was fulfilled which says,         ""He was reckoned with the transgressors.""  Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53, about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the messiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its surrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The servant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the description of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the messiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between two thieves would fulfill the ""prophecy"" in Isaiah.  Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons.         Mark goes on to tell us how ""those who were crucified with [Jesus] also reviled him."" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a couple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke decides to change some things.  Luke tells us,         [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged        with him railed, ""Aren't you the messiah?! Save        yourself, and us!""  This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the people who crucified Jesus said, ""Save yourself!"" and that the robbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,         But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,        ""Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same        sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,        for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.         But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,        ""Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.""         And Jesus answered, ""Verily I say to you, today you        will be with me in paradise.""  Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man, apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have been a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by Luke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.   Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case, the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have seen.  The End of the World--        Mt. 24:         Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and his disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world which he has been warning about.         The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's        destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your        coming, and of the close of the age?         Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for        many will come in my name, saying, ""I am the christ.""          ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for        this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,        nation will rise against nation... all this is but the        beginning of the birthpangs.              They will deliver you up... put you to death,        and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.        ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This        gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a        testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.              So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the        prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to        the mountains.               Immediately after the tribulation of those days,        the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from        heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man        in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,        and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out        his angels... and gather his elect...              Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its        branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know        that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these        things, you will know that He is near, at the very        gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not        pass away until all these things take place...              But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the        angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,        you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming        at an hour you do not expect.  From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells them that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it will come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error.  But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the End, and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be swept away.       There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, ""this generation shall not pass away..."" really means ""this race of people will not pass away...""  Of course, the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples.  It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek, he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at least some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World.  The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from Rev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus meant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.         For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th chapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000 years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back, hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon.  Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how tired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for just the right moment to spring?          So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth, (Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or three days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three eternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine radiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best interests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway.  As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them, Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have seen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout Church history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple belief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away from question.  To question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely accepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time.  Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity have been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support wars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which Christianity can securely keep hold."	0

    You have done no such thing.    An Islamic bank is a bank which operates according to the rules of Islam in regard to banking. This is done explicitly by the bank. This was not the case with BCCI.   This is crap. BCCI was motivated by the same motives as other international banks, with perhaps an emphasis on dealing with outlaws and the intelligence services of various governments.   Back to childish propaganda again. You really ought to get a life rather than wasting bandwith on such empty typing.

" Size of armies, duration, numbers of casualties both absolute and as a percentage of those involved, geographical area and numbers of countries too, are all measures of size.  In this case I'd say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants (total troops) compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area.   Vietnam and Korea might make good comparisons.   Western news in general, but in particular the American ""mass media"": CBS, NBC, ABC, etc.  The general tone of the news during the whole war was one of ""those poor, poor Iraqis"" along with ""look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits"".   I agree.   Perhaps so.  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  But that's easy to say from our ""enlightened"" viewpoint here in the 90's, right?  Back then, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed. After all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of  thousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and  millions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and  other people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.  All  things considered, the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were essential (and therefore justified) in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses.  I, for one, don't regret it.   Sure.  And it's the people who suffer because of them.  All the more reason to depose these ""entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests""!  Or do you mean that this applies to the allies as well??   I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the West before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America, misjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and  threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's oil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West before Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is responsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a strong response from the West was required.   Well, it's not very ""loving"" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I'd have to say yes, stopping Hussein was the most ""loving"" thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.  I mentioned it.  If we hadn't intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would have been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned in WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take Austria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting Hussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to protect Saudi Arabia.   Sure.  What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in his grandiose quest for a ""Thousand Year Reich"".  The consequences stemmed from that.  What should I say about them?  Anything in particular?    So?  It was the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King!!  And under American law they deserved a jury of *their* peers!  If there had been black officers involved, I'm sure their would have been black jurors too. This point (of allegedly racial motivations) is really shallow.   So?  It's ""hard to imagine""?  So when has Argument from Incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of ""Constructing a Logical Argument""?  Can we expect another revision soon??  :)  (Just kidding.)   I have to admit that I wonder this too.  But *neither* the prosecution nor the defense is talking.  So one cannot conclude either way due to the silence of the principals.     OK.  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved. And frankly, the original ""not guilty"" verdict baffled me too.  But then I learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which news commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California law.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it's evident that  the first jury decided that the officers were ""not guilty"".  Note,  not ""not guilty"" of doing wrong, but ""not guilty"" of aggravated assault  with the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the  prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a  verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.  If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then I feel the ""not guilty"" verdict was a reasonable one.   Thanks mathew, I like the quote.  Pretty funny actually.  (I'm a  Monty Python fan, you know.  Kind of seems in that vein.)  Of course, oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory.  But then, you know that already.    Regards,"	0

"Yesterday, I got the chance to hear Kurt Vonnegut speak at the University of New Hampshire. Vonnegut succeeded Isaac Asimov as the  (honorary?) head of the American Humanist Association. (Vonnegut is an atheist, and so was Asimov) Before Asimov's funeral, Vonnegut stood up and said about Asimov, ""He's in heaven now,"" which ignited uproarious  laughter in the room. (from the people he was speaking to around the time of the funeral)    ""It's the funniest thing I could have possibly said to a room full of humanists,"" Vonnegut said at yesterday's lecture.

    Define perfect then.       Take your foot out of your mouth, I wondered about that already when I was a Catholic Christian. The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why I am an atheist.   Believe me, I believed similar sentences for a long time. But that shows the power of religion and not anything about its claims.       It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil, is another evil.       The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even before the omnipotent has created them. There is no choice left. All is known, the course of events is fixed.   Not even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by James Tims.       And when I am not omnipotent, how can I have free will? You have said something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have what you define as free will.   Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them. Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence of good as evil.   But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it. Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.   (Deletion)   That the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys the credibility of the bible, nothing less.	0
"  Anyone who dies for a ""cause"" runs the risk of dying for a lie.  As for people being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters and charlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield had been the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.   Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't the first to be ""witnessed.""  What sets him apart?   Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and  megalomaniacs throughout history.  Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, Khomeini, Qadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century. Koresh is a non-issue.    Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course.  There are flaws in your logic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!    Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something is written in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plus the lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if you do quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with  supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.    Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you  define the world ""total,"" but I would imagine a ""total sacrafice [sp] of everything for God's sake"" would involve more than a time commitment.  You are correct about our tendency to ""box everything into time units."" Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe) television?"	0

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism    3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)    4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument    5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources  This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The others are entirely optional.  If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled ""A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community"", ""Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet"" and ""Hints on writing style for Usenet"" are particularly relevant.  Questions concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.

However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    ""Alt.Atheism FAQ:"".  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    ""Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup"" carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are ""help"" and    ""send atheism/index"".  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.    it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files. "	0

"  (Deletion)   For me, it is a ""I believe no gods exist"" and a ""I don't believe gods exist"".   In other words, I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless. In Ontology, one can fairly conclude that when ""A exist"" is meaningless A does not exist. Under the Pragmatic definition of truth, ""A exists"" is meaningless makes A exist even logically false.   A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all. Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others.     (Deletion)"	0

"New in this version:  challenge #5, plus an addendum summarizing Charley's responses to-date.. -----------------------------------------  *** This is a posting made periodically in an attempt to encourage *** Charley Wingate to address direct challenges to his evidently  *** specious claims.  I'll continue to re-post periodically until *** he answers them, publicly indicates that he won't answer them, *** stops posting to alt.atheism, the alt.atheism community tells *** me to stop, or I get totally bored.  I apologize for the  *** somewhat juvenile nature of this approach, but I'm at a loss *** to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and  *** seeming intellectual dishonesty. *** *** This is re-post #3.   Charley,  I can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts.  I submit that you don't answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once again challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for you as possible, I'll present concise re-statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see.  Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I will re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at such time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup.  I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it from this list.  Now, to the questions...  1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating that you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some atheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your stereotype?  Here is the context for the question:    2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that ""senses and reason are all we have to go by"", and when pressed, you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...   then later...   then later...    3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify one such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical?  If so, please repeat them.  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the ""axioms"" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer the question.  Please do so now.  Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that effect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism?  Here is the context for the question:  [First quote] [Second quote]   5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these Challenges because they contained too much in the way of ""included text"" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn't respond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify this seeming contradiction.  Question:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context from your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to avoid ""included text""?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    As usual, your responses are awaited with anticipation.  --Dave Wood   p.s., For the record, below is a compilation of Charley's responses to these challenges to date.  3/18/93  3/31/93 (#1)  3/31/93 (#2)"	0

" Secular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life, Islam places the rights of society and every member in it above  the rights of the individual, this is what I call true human rights.   As a Muslim living in a non-Muslim land I am bound by the laws of the land I live in, but I do not disregard Islamic Law it still remains a part of my  life. If the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent that I am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then I must  leave the land. So in a way Islamic law does take precendence over secular law but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too.  In an Islamic state (one ruled by a Khaliphate) religions other than Islam are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they don't affect the genral population and don't come into direct conflict with state  laws, Dhimmis (non-Muslim population) are exempt from most Islamic laws on religion, such as fighting in a Jihad, giving Zakat (alms giving) etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as Military protection and if they are poor they will receive Zakat.   After the Fatwa didn't Rushdie re-affirm his faith in Islam, didn't he go thru' a very public ""conversion"" to Islam? If so he is binding himself to Islamic Laws. He has to publicly renounce in his belief in Islam so the burden is on him.  Mas  "	0
" This is a good point, but I think ""average"" people do not take up Christianity so much out of fear or escapism, but, quite simply, as a way to improve their social life, or to get more involved with American culture, if they are kids of immigrants for example.  Since it is the overwhelming major religion in the Western World (in some form or other), it is simply the choice people take if they are bored and want to do something new with their lives, but not somethong TOO new, or TOO out of the ordinary.  Seems a little weak, but as long as it doesn't hurt anybody...    These are good quotes, and I agree with both of them, but let's make sure to alter the scond one so that includes something like ""...let him be, as long as he is not preventing others from finding their peace."" or something like that.

Their popularity seems to come and go.  I remember when I first entered High School, I was an atheist (always had been) and so were about 7 of my friends.  At this time, 5 of those 7 have converted, always to Christianity (they were all also immigrants from Taiwan, or sons of immigrants, hence my earlier gross generalization).  Christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than it ever has before (since I've been noticing).  Maybe it is just my perceptions that are chagning.  Who knows? I for one am perfectly willing to live and let live with them, so long as we have some set of abstract rights/agreements on how we should treat each other: I have no desire to be hurt by them or their notions.  For all the well-put arguments on this usenet, it never does any good.  Argumentation does not really seem to apply to Christians (or even some atheists)- it must simply be a step the person takes naturally, almost, ""instinctively""...   best regards,  ******************************************************************************** * Adam John Cooper  ""Verily, often have I laughed at the weaklings * *       who thought themselves good simply because  * * acooper@macalstr.edu    they had no claws.""        * ********************************************************************************"	0

"[reply to zazen@austin.ibm.com (E. H. Welbon)]         For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word ""on faith"", we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found."	0

"  This book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue.   The book is in two sections.  Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the Bible, showing many inconsistencies between the Bible and modern science.  Well we all know that, no surprises.  Section 2 analyses the Koran's version of the Old Testament stories, and seems, on the face of it, to present a good case showing the Koran is consistent with modern science.  However, it was plain to me, that this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the Koran.  Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail, (""forty days and forty nights"", ""pair of every animal"", etc.), we all know this is nonsense.  The Koran's description of the same event is so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as ""A big river  flooded for a few days and caused much damage"".  Yes, no contradiction but also not much fact.  The Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that time, does not seem much of an achievement.  The book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot of (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them can be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book by talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.  The above is, of course, from memory so I may have missed some points.    -- "	0
"  (Deletion)   No it in the way it is usually used. In my view, you are saying here that driving a car requires faith that the car drives.   For me it is a conclusion, and I have no more faith in it than I have in the premises and the argument used.       No, that's a word game. The term god is used in a different way usually. When you use a different definition it is your thing, but until it is commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and that does not exist, it is existence itself, so I say it does not exist.   Interestingly, there are those who say that ""existence exists"" is one of the indubitable statements possible.   Further, saying god is existence is either a waste of time, existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god, or you are implying more with it, in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete, making it a fallacy.     (Deletion) (Deletion)   Where does that follow? Aren't observations based on the assumption that something exists?   And wouldn't you say there is a level of definition that the assumption ""god is"" is meaningful. If not, I would reject that concept anyway."	0
  It is all written in _The_Wholly_Babble:_the_Users_Guide_to_Invisible_ _Pink_Unicorns_.  To be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns, you must read the Babble, and obey what is written in it.  To obey what is written in the Babble, you must believe that doing so is the way to be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns.  To believe that obeying what is written in the Babble leads to believing in invisible pink unicorns, you must, essentially, believe in invisible pink unicorns.  This bit of circular reasoning begs the question: What makes obeying different from believing?	0
"  That's right, and this is pretty impossible, right?  It would be ideal if we could believe for a while, just to try out religion, and only then determine which course of thought suits us best.  But again, this is not possible.  Not that religion warrants belief, but the belief carries with it some psychological benefits.  There are also some psychological burdens, too.   Well, if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism, they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually ""believing"" in racism.  Of course, the parallel happens to be a poor one, but you originated it."	0

 I could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout back in the 1960s. The issue wasn't gays, but the principles were the same. Thanks for a well put testimonial. Stan Krieger and his kind who think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. The BSA has been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts haven't given up. Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that scouting is still worth fighting for.  On a cautionary note, you must realize that if your experience with this camp leader was in the BSA you may be putting him at risk by publicizing it. Word could leak out to the BSA gestapo.	0
: You know, it just occurred to me today that this whole Christian thing : can be blamed solely on Mary. :  : So, she's married to Joseph.  She gets knocked up.  What do you think : ol' Joe will do if he finds she's been getting around?  So Mary comes up : with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant.   :     Nice attempt Chris . . . verrry close.    You missed the conspiracy by 1 step. Joseph knew who knocked her up. He couldn't let it be known that somebody ELSE got ol' Mary prego. That wouldn't do well for his popularity in the local circles. So what  happened is that she was feeling guilty, he was feeling embarrassed, and THEY decided to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise been the downfall for both. Clever indeed. Come to think of it . . . I have gained a new respect for the couple. Maybe Joseph and Mary should receive all of the praise being paid to jesus.	0
    It was no criticism of Islam for a change, it was a criticism of the arguments used. Namely, whenever people you identify as Muslims are the victims of the attacks of others, they are used an argument for the bad situation of Muslims. But whenever deeds by Muslim that victimize others are named, they do not count as an argument because what these people did was not done as a true Muslims. No mention is made how Muslims are the cause of a bad situation of another party.	0
 Seems he didn't understand anything about realities, liar, lunatic or the real thing is a very narrow view of the possibilities of Jesus message.

  I don't think we need to argue about this.   Yes, but also many people who are not trying to make government recognize Christianity as the dominant religion in this country do no think the motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share their beliefs.  And actually, I think that the government already does recognize that Christianity is the dominant religion in this country.  I mean, it is. Don't you realize/recognize this?  This isn't to say that we are supposed to believe the teachings of Christianity, just that most people do.   If you agree with me, then what are we discussing?   No, but I hear quite a bit about Christmas, and little if anything about Jesus.  Wouldn't this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really associated to a high degree with him?  Or are you saying that the association with Jesus is on a personal level, and that everyone thinks about it but just never talks about it?

    It's not really their _decision_ to be tried. The rulings _do_ have legal consequences, but only in Islamic law and not in UK law (this should be obvious). Enforcing a judgment is distinct from the making of a judgment. Take for example the judgments of the World Court. This is an internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no physical or economic effect but which _are_ important despite the fact that their judgments cannot be enforced    Of course, have you read any of this thread before this post?

"  Yes I fully agree with that, but is it ""I don't believe gods exist"", or ""I believe no gods exist""? As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka) pointed out, it all hinges on what you take the word ""believe"" to mean.  Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak atheism, at least according to the FAQ:  # Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. # Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is # often referred to as the ""weak atheist"" position, and the latter as ""strong # atheism"". #  # It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  ""Weak # atheism"" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  ""Strong # atheism"" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not # fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are ""strong atheists"".

"frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer) writes ...  While I'll agree that these are generally held to be ""good things"", I question whether they come very close to being objective values. Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally ""good"" or ""bad"".  And when I referred to ""the truth"" I was using the term hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some ""higher authority"" (aka, absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it. "	0

 Yes, worshipping Jesus as the super-saver is indeed hero-worshipping of the grand scale. Worshipping Lenin that will make life pleasant for the working people is, eh, somehow similar, or what.

 +Last night, while watching the 2a.m. rebroadcast of Jerry Springer (a +talk show) I heard this Jewel of a thought from a 12 year old racist.  +The focus of this show was on these kids and their hatred for the Jewish +religion, and why.    [some stuff deleted]  +Interesting (and scary) no?  They went on to say how the Jews had  +killed their god, and how in the end of time that all the races would +go to their homelands (of course, they would remain in America, which +is New Jeruselem, as it says in Gen 2??? (what another kid said) but +the rest of the races would go home) and then the great battle or plague +or whatever Revel. says would happen, and the jews would be killed. + +The most interesting thing about this was that my roomate is Catholic,  +and had the KJV of the Bible on his desk.  He immediatly opened it up +and began to search for the quoted passages (Gen, Rev, and John) to  +look for himself, and couldn't find what they said they saw.  I don't +know  I saw this show a while back, and when I heard these kids quote the Bible to justify their racist claims, I looked up that quote about Jesus hating Jews (since Jesus himself was a Jew, my curiousity had been piqued by such a claim). The jist of the passage (and I am sorry but I can't recall which passage it was exactly) was that Jesus was condemning the Pharisees for being corrupt. Of course, the Pharisees were Jewish too, but it wasn't Jews as a whole that Jesus was condemning, just the powers that be. 	0
I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population.  It is rather a ridiculous question in some ways, I know, but my newsreader is down so I am not getting any new postings for a bit, so I figure I might as well post something new myself.  Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it expresses its own selfishness.

Perhaps the chimps that failed to evolve cooperative behaviour died out, and we are left with the ones that did evolve such behaviour, entirely by chance.  Are you going to proclaim a natural morality every time an organism evolves cooperative behaviour?  What about the natural morality of bee dance?"	0

    I see, it is not rational, but it is intellectual. Does madness qualify as intellectual engagement, too?       Exactly why science uses mathematics. QM representation in natural language is not supposed to replace the elaborate representation in mathematical terminology. Nor is it supposed to be the truth, as opposed to the representation of gods or religions in ordinary language. Admittedly, not  every religion says so, but a fancy side effect of their inept representations are the eternal hassles between religions.   And QM allows for making experiments that will lead to results that will be agreed upon as being similar. Show me something similar in religion.       With the effect that the models presented are useless. And one can argue that the other way around, namely that the only reason metaphysics still flourish is because it makes no statements that can be verified or falsified - showing that it is bogus.    	0
 I'm sure zero-intested economical systems survive on a small-scale, co-ops is not an Islamic invention, and we have co-operatives working all around the world. However such systems don't stand the corruption of a large scale operation. Actually, nothing could handle human greed, IMHO. Not even Allah :-).  Cheers, Kent	0
" I pondered it for all of ten seconds when I realised that since we don't have any reliable statistics for sexual promiscuity, and since the whole issue of ""depression"" isn't at all well  defined for earlier centuries, you are probably talking crap.

  AHA! He admits it! He IS a moral relativist!

"[deleted] think: [deleted]                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Let me first say that ""to believe that no gods exist"" is in fact  different than ""not believing in a god or gods"".   I will argue that your latter statement, ""I believe that no gods exist"" does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement  that ""no gods exist"" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don't   know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then (weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying   I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even  after reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.  But first let me say the following. We might have a language problem here - in regards to ""faith"" and ""existence"". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist. To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE being - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointless to debate the so called ""existence"" of God - and that is not what I'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of being. When you say that ""god does not exist"", I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However, in what follows I will use the phrase ""the existence of God"" in it's 'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it. I would like a clarification upon what you mean by ""the existence of God"".   We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what  faith  1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY b  (1): fidelity to one's promises    (2): sincerity of intentions 2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God    (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    (2): complete trust 3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF    One can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say that you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion ""based upon observation"", I will have to ask ""what observtions are you refering to?"" There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes  partents ""believe in God"" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion about the ""existence"" or ""non-existence"" of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say ""I believe that God   does/does not exist"". Personally, I think that both statements are misguided. Arguing over the ""existence"" of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him (and yes, I use ""Him"" because a personal God is the only  viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use ""She"" go ahead. Of course  God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to  anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be  glad to.)     And please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently  disagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person  thinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think  I have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my  ways and I correct the situation. I'm interested in a polite and well   thought out discussion.         "	0

"  The ""`little' things"" above were in reference to Germany, clearly.  People said that there were similar things in Germany, but no one could name any. They said that these were things that everyone should know, and that they weren't going to waste their time repeating them.  Sounds to me like no one knew, either.  I looked in some books, but to no avail.   It has *caused* problems?  Again, no one has shown that things were better before the motto, or that they'd likely be better after.

  But you haven't taken into the account of propoganda.  Remember, if you asked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered, they would probably answer no, but, after the propoganda machine rolled through, at least some were able to tolerate it.  You see, it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general frenzy.   Well, they haven't managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the courts.  But, they have managed to create quite a few problems for people that wanted to have an abortion.  They could create similar problems for us.  And, it could be worse.  They can try to stop abortions by blocking clinics, etc., but imagine what they'd have to do to stop atheism.   So, you are able to convince them individually, but could you convince a whole room of them?  A whole nation?   Yes, I'd be glad if it were gone to.  I've never supported it.  However, I think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored, contrasted with what *could* happen (an what may be likely).   Well, I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key (the motto can be attributed to him), but it is at least clear that he believed in a god.  And, surely there are a few Christians that think as you say, but I don't think that most do.  Do you think that all Christians actively despise other religions?  Most that I have met haven't and don't do so.   Well, I have asked a Hindu, Moselem, and a few Jews, and all of them think that it is applicable to them.  Of course, I can't say that these people (just some that I know pretty well) are accurate representations of their faiths.   Well, I'd really like to, and I've tried, but I really don't know where to get access to _Congressional Records_ from the 1950's.  Can anyone help out here?   Only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs.    So, are you saying that they redesign the plates each year?  Anyway, your whole argument (conveniently deleted I see) was that the motto somehow costs us all a lot of money.  This is just not correct.   That is to say, the religion of this country, and the non-religion of the USSR.  That was what most of those quotes were about, and some included all atheists, in general, as well.  I don't think that any of the quotes (although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus. They advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not mentioned.   So, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  That's silly. I think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I don't advocate their banishment.   I think that any such cost would be insignificant.  I mentioned the slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by being on our currency.   Well, mottos in general don't really have purposes...  I don't think it should be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the consequences.   Then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.   Why not?  It is the majority that put it there.   But do they remember the debate surrounding the motto?  Do they remember that some people intended it to be a message against atheists?  Why don't you include this in your little survey that you were conducting?  [...]  What?  Should I ask some scientists the probability that something Einstein said about relativity is worthy?  I mean, if Einstein said it, there's a good chance that it was right (at least at the time).   You need not agree with them all of the time, but you would certainly think that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point.   No, I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court Justice to testify before Congress during the consideration of a Constitutional Amendment.  And, in order for the Court to rule on something, a case usually must be presented.   Yes, some mushrooms can be planted.  And, I don't appreciate mushrooms on my pizza, either.

  For the last time, Bobby. Lack of belief in YOUR god does NOT imply atheism. Just because some moslems aren't moral does not mean they don't believe in a god named Allah, although their Allah may not do the things your Allah does. If a moslem says he/she believes that a god exists, he/she is a theist (though maybe not a TRUE follower of islam).    Jerk. 	0
 Nope, Germany has extremely restrictive citizenship laws.  The  ethnic Germans who have lived in Russia for over 100 years  automatically become citizens if they move to Germany, but the Turks who are now in their third generation in Germany can't.

 Sorry.   Wrong.    This is how banks got started in the first place. Sooner or later your father and his pals will lend money to someone who eventually goes broke, and then they will realise that they havn't been managing risk very well.   Then they will ask themselves what it is that they need to quantify risk, and to persuade borrowers not to take on greater loans than they can carry.    And since they don't all want the worry of doing the calculations and handling the money, some of them will specialise in that.  Then they'll reinvent interest, but like good Muslims, they'll call it something else.   Riiiight.   That's why John Major opened a new government department a couple of months ago to help to promote minority business.   Because they can do it all themselves by lending one another cups of sugar.	0
   Damn right you can't provide any evidence for it.      Rarely are any widespread social phenomenon reducible to such a   simple premise.  If they were, psychology would be a hard science   with roughly the same mathematical soundness as physics.      Your premise may well be right.  It is much more likely, however,   that it reflects your socialization and religious background, as   well as your need to validate your religious beliefs.  Were I to   pretend to have all the answers (and I don't), I would say that the   xenophobia, guilt, and intolerance brought about by adherence to    fundamentalist religions play just as large a role in depressing   the members of our society.

DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  ""Galactic Pot-Healer"" A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  ""A Maze of Death"" Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  ""VALIS"" The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.

Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  ""The Handmaid's Tale"" A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it ""right"" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the ""old world"" are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.

RICHARD SWINBURNE  ""The Existence of God (Revised Edition)"", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with ""The Coherence of Theism"" (1977) and was concluded with ""Faith and Reason"" (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie's ""The Miracle of Theism"".  In the revised edition of ""The Existence of God"", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  ""The Miracle of Theism"", Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as ""replacements for God"" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

" As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer the circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary opening and closing of the path.  The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high impedance audio circuits a resistive ""T"" is constructed close to characteristic impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers the audio.  In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic impedance.  Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.  Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to ""Make before break and Vica Versa"" but I haven't seen any of these for years.  Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.  A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive ""optical isolator"".. It consists of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers passing the audio.  Once again this device in a ""T"" switches the audio.  Varying the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and you have a mixer!

 Water. Nuclear stations don't generate electricity directly from the reactor, they use the reactor to generate heat. The heat is then used to heat water just as in a conventional oil or coal station, and the resultant steam drives the turbines.  The cooling towers are used to cool the steam and recondense it into water to continue the cycle  Steve 	0

"Yes, you increase the RPM slip of a ""boxer"" type fan by installing a capacitor in series with the fan's power supply.  The air flow of small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4 uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application.  For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan. It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.  I wish I knew who made the fans for Radio Shack.  "	0

"Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or contribution to:  In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.  The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too!  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.  Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was ""no way!""  But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.  For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave enlightment may be necessary.  So, the questions are -   What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?   Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by   a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector   antenna?   Are any brands ""quieter"" than others?"	0

   With relays alone, you will always get a transient when you abruptly turn ON or OFF any channel.  If you don't want to hear the transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator is the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch, THEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.   It used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors in switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few thousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which drives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  And, the devices are cheaper than relays.	0
 Oddly enough, you don't, at least according to the wiring FAQ that is regularly posted on misc.consumers.house.  A GFCI senses discrepancies between the live and neutral wire currents, and cuts them both off if a discrepancy is found.  No ground connection is needed for it to function.   	0

I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling components.  For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.  Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour).  Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more (although that would be a lousy way to control it).  What I would like to know is:  1: Are the above guesses correct?  2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?    (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm    too fast when I unplug it)  3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks like    magic!  4: Why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?   Thanks in advance,  Paul.	0
I missed the first article[s] on this line due to not having a chance to read the news for a couple of days...  The idea is commercialized in at least one product, the Private Eye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around the head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes from the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned in front of the user's eye.  The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA compatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept up and down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that the sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual image projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse with the background.  I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if I looked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus tracking if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key. The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found annoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properly used, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.  I don't know if the company has taken the technology any further in the last year or two, but it did seem to have promise.  	0
 Imprecise. This description   1. ignores the role of the ballast,  2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.  The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge.  The starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually, the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.  A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent excessive arcing during the firing.  The neon reionizes but does not draw sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself.	0
I booked a hotel (Red Roof Inn) last week in Cincinnati (Blue Ash, which is at the northern tip of the metro. Cincy area).  I chose it for a few reasons.   1.

 Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that...I sounds to me, your UPS takes in AC, rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries, and then takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again, feeding your equipment.  This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since, as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.  Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you lose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to replace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and you've got to resync the AC in no time flat.  Unfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that AC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to be usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.  Similar story with our telephone system.  It was first invented back in the 1800's.  We're still using the same damn system (media) as they did back then.  If I have a phone from back then, I can assure you it'll work on today's phone system.  It costs too much to overhaul everyone to a new system, so they make it work with what is out there.	0
 What you have is one of the LD players from a video game (Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, etc).

: On December 29, 1992, it was illegal to operate a radar detector : in the state of Virginia.  If one got caught, one got fined $65.00. : Ask me how I know.  The Federal Communications Act of 1934 made it *legal* for you to operate a radio receiver of any kind, on any frequency (including X, K, and Ka bands) in the United States.  The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1989(?) restricted the FCA of 1934 by making it illegal to receive the land-mobile telephone service, including (I believe) cellular phones.  No restriction was placed on receiving RADAR (or, curiously, cordless phones.)  Enforcement of the Virginia law is in violation of the FCA of 1934.

" A method which will directly (almost) provide you with the information that you require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of  human body landmarks (eg. the SELSPOT system by SELSPOT AB, Sweden, and the WATSMART System ??).  These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence, the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of the crystal).

I had a similar idea, for a fax/answering machine switch, to put both machines on one line.  You order distinctive ringing from your phone company.  This is $3/month here. You get a second (unpublished) phone number.  When someone calls this number, your phone rings with short rings instead of long rings.  You set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax on six rings.  You'd give out the new # as your fax #. A device would measure the length of rings.  When it detects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine. Five rings later your fax picks up the call.  This should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80 switches now available.  But that's not what I did.  I'm giving out the new # to my friends and customers.  This should leave the old # for telemarketers, etc.  I won't pick up the phone when I hear the long rings.	0

 Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on  the frontend.  Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly 12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that far down is probably a big no-no.

I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by buying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile I noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is, I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some random 50mV bias.  The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output won't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed from my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input impedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have maximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have input impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing reasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series. With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now with this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of a pain in  the ass.  Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd like to have this box not be active.  Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. The function generator was the same way on that one, too.     please help as I am feeling very stupid     today,	0
1)  Output offset:  Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope and adjust the internal output offset contorl.  There is virtual certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset control's zero detent position.  2)  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded.  Many generators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load.  Go to a hamfest flea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohm terminator that has a male and female BNC (or whatever) connector on it.  The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out .4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load.  You may also find that loading the output of the function generator also reduces the harmonic distortion.  Build an attenuator.  You don't have to use (and I wouldn't want to use) the input impedance of the device under test as part of the voltage divider to drop the input test voltage.  Consider this:  ------10K--------+---------? ohm ----                  | Gen            50 ohm            D.U.T. (loaded)         | -----------------+-------------------  Think about the ratio of 50/10K and then think about the accuracy to which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope.  You can virtually discount the loading of the D.U.T.  Also you have the millivolt test generator you want.  Good luck,  	0

"  Actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are 1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than nuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted (""why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go."").   3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.    Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the  heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because  moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine  low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best.    A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the  condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too  hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs.    The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower  they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120  degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer, operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order  to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area.  At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical ""95-95"" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East. It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure.   True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard  stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves. The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water.  By ""impure"", I mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved oxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will  find outside the laboratory.  John"	0

 Heh, heh, heh, heh....I laugh because I have the same damn TV, and it did the same thing!  Actually it is a Goldstar, but it's essentially the same TV and electronics--just a different face plate and name.  #1.  Fortunately, TV tubes don't explode.  I'd think the TV mfrs want to make this possibility remote as possible.  If at all, they'll  *implode* and the glass that blows out would be the result of the glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion. In any case, don't kick it around! :-)   #2  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics.  It turned out to be a blown 2W resistor feeding the flyback transformer.  I guess the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it created, burning itself out.  I checked to make sure the flyback wasn't shorted or anything first!

One connection is a 30-way IDC, the other a 60-way IDC.  If anyone has any information on this device, I would be most grateful if you could provide it.  Thanks.   Chris Powell.	0

Check out Xicor's new goodie in the April 12th edition of EETimes X88C64 - an 8k * 8 E2PROM with built in latch AND bootloader setup. You hook it directly to your '51, power it up, the prom initialises the serial port on the '51, you load in your code via RXD, this gets blatted onto the E2PROM, then you reset and run - i'm sure Dallas also does something like this too, i suppose it would boil down to relative prices, and the Dallas part freeing up P0 & P2 completely. I wonder if ANYONE has ever managed to design a single sided PCB with an 8051, 573, EPROM, SRAM and >>NO LINKS<< ? cheers Mike. 	0

 This was the Pathe you are thinking of, although there were other imitators. It didn't wear the disks any more than conventional acoustic designs, but it did have a high noise level due to the continual hiss of escaping air.

Sounds like the picture tube lost vacuum.  This would cause the filament to ignite and could actually turn the tube from a vacuum to a pressure vessel, followed by an explosion when the neck assembly (mostly likely cracked to begin with) blows off.  During the whole sequence of events, the other circuits may continue functioning, which accounts for not losing sound. 	0

" What do you mean by ""police band"" - there is no such thing.  Anyway, radar detectors work in shared bands. If you applied your test, all of those radar operated door openers in malls would be illegal.  One of the great problems here is that there are too many ill-educated (read illiterate) people making too many laws about subjects on which they are incompetent - there may well be laws refereing to ""police bands"", they are almost certainly local in scope (state or county) - created by well-meaning, but incompetent idiots.  Unfortunaltely, laws do not have to be sensible (or even enforceable). Lawmakers exist to pass laws - and will continue to do so, until the day where you are faced with death for not doing X, and amputation of all your limbs for doing X ... the choice will be yours.

"I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and word has it that something similar is on its way here.  Since we apparently don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the video being piped into a command center they're building somewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large multi-colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system.  In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it will be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read ""cheap"").  We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is applicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some other TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information. I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly fees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing more, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)  I think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more info on how the LA system is networked and paid for."	0

 Are any of the inputs to the chip coming from TTL?  Standby-drain specs for CMOS chips typically apply only if inputs are pulled all the way down to zero or all the way up to Vcc.  TTL isn't good at doing the former and it won't do the latter at all without help from pullup resistors.  This sort of thing can easily multiply power consumption by a considerable factor, because the CMOS transistors that are supposed to be OFF aren't all the way hard OFF.	0
"    [...]  I think you posted your article 15 days too late :-)) April 1st is over. I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such ""storys"" about them. OK ? Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:    -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.          It has an hightech ""boiler"" but the rest is still verry verry           conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-          powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.          If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find          a chapter about the ""CARNOT-process"" which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason          for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an          temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the           energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to          let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and ""cold""          steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.          And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of          energy that carnot will give them.          The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !          The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,          because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in          AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment !              -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-          Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with          the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.          This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures          up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.      -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the          years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem          at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have          1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and          getting children with 2 heads. This is my point of view.            Only my 0.02$ !

  Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company. The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggest problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.  In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets with the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things you can plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers they were a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory periodically.  With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be less of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longer recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their equipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will find that the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal, it should be o.k. for most applications.  ---  . SLMR 2.1 .

   I second that suggestion.  Although I don't own the HP Portable Deskjet, I *do* own the HP Deskjet 500.  It gives the nicest outputs, with only a minor loss of quality.   For all intensive purposes (papers, letters, resumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have to look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters).  Only one grudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the presence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof).  However, you would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality.  The cannon bubblejets are nice, however they don't seem to have as much support (eg: drivers for popular programs) as the HP ink-jets. Also HP Deskjet (regular,plus,500,500c) accepts xerox paper (I believe that the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet).  If you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink (say fountain-pen ink), then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain (I paid $3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9 months).    -Kimball (who doesn't work for HP, but just loves his printer     very much!)	0

  Are you sure that he needs a two way converter? If he wants only RS232->TTL I would suggest the MC1489, its very cheap (0.80 DM in Germany). This chip needs only +5V. The MC1488 TTL->RS232-Converter uses +12V and -12V.  BTW... The MAX232 and compatibles seem to be expensive in the USA...

I'm : particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10.7 -- do any : current chips work up to, say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a : normal IF filter can be used?  : Any suggestions?  : John    What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the 10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings.    I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz. The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.    The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).    While using this would have let me reduce the ""external"" IF count on receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I didn't bother with it.    The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2 MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data stream is another matter entirely.    Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a ""beacon"" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of a second.    I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time, money and energy.    If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally polarized.    I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your ""target"".  If you can't arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS. For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems. I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.  73 Glenn Elmore n6gn"	0

  I guess 100k, connecting pins 1-3 (1x), 1-6 (1y), 9-11 (2x), and 9-13 (2y).  Or: Get an 8-bit DA-Converter (merely a couple of transistors and Resistors) and an OpAmp to compare its output to the voltage you want to measure, connect them to a spared printer port (if you have one), and do the rest by software (stepwise refinement). The port addresses for your printer ports are probably: &H378 (LPT1), &H278 (LPT2). This should work well enough for your purposes.

If the set is direct line powered, try checking the [likely to be there] hybrid regulator module down stream from the 170 volt supply.  Several sets I've looked at use a 135 volt regulator.  The regulators have a tendency to short out, making the safety circuits shut down the EHT supply section.  Try putting the set on a Variac or adjustable transformer and lower the AC input voltage to the set to about 90 volts.  If the set operates nromally, then you know you've got a shorted regulator.  There are myriad other areas for problems, but I've seen the one above several times.  Also, if the set uses one, the trippler module may be shot; that's fairly common.  	0
"   Ok, here could be the first question or answer or something:  Q: I want to copyprotect a program I wrote.  How should I do it? A: You would be wise not to copyprotect that program.

So, the copy protection wouldn't stop those.    Ok, then.  What about legitimate users?  Copy protection can be a hassle    for legitimate users, and can hinder them in their work, expecially    if there is some ""key"" item that can get lost.

"    Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to ""back out"" the errors in its position (since it knows where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit.  The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system which has stations all across the US.  The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format. Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- John P. Baker                   | My opinions are my own.

Here in Erie, PA there is a system in the inner city called Rado-Lite (a  trade name) which allows police and ambulance vehicles to gain right of  way by controlling traffic lights through RADIO signals.

It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a PC.  Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital Domain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design. (That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed - I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)  If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at the MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete sampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it uses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design guide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db max (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces  A evaluation kit is available.  Might want to give these nice folks a call.  1-800-998-8800 or fax: (408)737-7194 and (408) 737-7600 ext4000 for application assistance.  This assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software. (Hey you can get the MAX121 as a free sample just by calling the 1-800 #)   I would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out of your system by looking at the noise level, otherwise you might be throwing out your money.

  From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive device much like the radio in your car.  They work as an antenna picking up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out.  Therefore there would be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.  	0
   This is indeed one function, but more sophisticated ones do level control and ground-lift (separating the keyboard and mixer earths) aswell.   Simple ones are just that - a transformer. A decent quality audio trans- former will cost most of that $50. They are wired thus...

The transformer ratio depends on the precise application, but around 10:1 turns ratio may be a good place to start.  Christopher	0
"  In four replies, I've seen no hard numbers, so here goes:  For traces on the outside (not inner layers), expect, in 1 oz copper, at 15 amps, the following temperature rises versus width.

Power goes as square of the current, plus the copper resistance goes up as temperature goes up...  Certainly .20"" (~5mm) traces should be  ample for what you want to do.  And 2 ounce copper almost cuts the  required width in half.  (I'd do 2 oz at about 0.08"" width myself,  I think...given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 is a transient or fault condition.)"	0
Several years back one of the radar detectors manufacturers, in defiance to Virginia's law against radar detectors, passed out thousands of fake cardboard radar detectors at truck stops near the Virginia State lines.  At that time there were no radar detector Detectors!  I am not sure of the impact but I would imagine that enforcement of the law by visually sighting a radar detector became difficult - if not impossible!  As I said earlier, efforts to throw out or eliminate the VA law against radar detectors has been in vain.  In fact, effective Jan. 1, 1993, the fine for possession of a radar detector accessable to the driver of a vehicle in VA is now $250.00.    I have noted an interesting anomality with my Alinco DR-100 2 meter ham transceiver.... It will make a *cheap* radar detector scream!  I am not sure of the range, but it is obvious by the brake lights that it can be at least 50 feet at 50 watts! :-)	0
   Like most high-volume manufacturers, Adcom has most of its PC boards assembled off-shore (in their case, mostly in the far east).  Final assembly _and testing_ are done in East Brunswick.  The products are, and have always been, designed entirely in the US; by their own staff and by audiophile gurus like Walter Jung.  Adcom also tends to prefer American and European components over their Japanese/Far East equivalents.  Off-shore assembly is one reason that Adcom is able to make products that perform as well as those from people like Audio Research and Van Alstine (and better than Hafler and Forte'), but at a much lower cost.  Of course, if your musical diet consists mostly of Rock, you might prefer components from Kenwood or Pioneer...	0
Hi !!!  Is there somebody using a 56001 DSP from Motorola ??? I am searching for programms concerning audio effects. I built a 4 channel mixer (4ADC + 1DSP) for audio signals. I built some digital filters and echos, but now i want to include some effects like HARMONIC Equalizer or chorus. The problem is, I dont know how these effects work (so I cant write a programm). So if someone has programms or just knows how such effects work, please contact me in the newsgroup or via e-mail. (Also if there are books about this problem)	0

According to my TI databook, the pinouts for the TIL311 display are as follows:    Pin 1 - LED supply voltage  Pin 2 - Latch data input B  Pin 3 - Latch data input A  Pin 4 - Left decimal point cathode  Pin 5 - Latch strobe input  Pin 6 - Omitted  Pin 7 - Common ground  Pin 8 - Blanking input  Pin 9 - Omitted   Pin 10 - Right decimal point cathode  Pin 11 - Omitted  Pin 12 - Latch data input D  Pin 13 - Latch data input C  Pin 14 - Logic supply voltage, Vcc   The logic supply voltage is 5V @ 60-90mA. The LED supply is also 5V, but it need not be particularly well regulated. The LED drivers on the chip use a constant current source, so LED intensity is not affected by the supply voltage.    -- 	0
$50 each!!  Don't bother trying to make one yourself, just shop around a little.  I've found DOD brand DI boxes for as cheap as $20 each.  You can  get higher end ones for more, but for PA use for bands, I wouldn't bother.

I posted this about tow weeks ago but never saw it make it (Then again I've had some problems with the mail system). Apologies if this appears for the second time:  Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry  option the window appears right away, the properties specified by the -geometry argument. The question now is:  How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour.

"From article <1993Apr17.010256.14372@eafs000.ca.boeing.com>, by ten0772@eafs000.ca.boeing.com (Timothy E. Neto):  This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to do with this.  Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.  That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays, or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination.  Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.  The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h, MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek, this is 12.  As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case.  We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course, I could say ""Buy all you want, we'll support more."" -- "	0

  As I've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented, you can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several layers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree's until you get to the root will work in most cases, but there's no guarantee that the outside decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm). 	0

Hi Xperts,  this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8-( I can't believe there is no XView wizards any more 8-)...  I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field. In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters, in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by  PANEL_MAX_VALUE!   As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit:   /* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,   * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes   */  PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL = PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,    152),  PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH = PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,   182),  which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0.  Strange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space in a text fields, but not Sun's Xview...  Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me, and clear this problem?   Any help is very much appreciated.  Yuri	0

[Apologies if I'm answering something already answered in the FAQ. Our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately - so I haven't seen the FAQ lately to check.]   Two ways:    1) When you start the xterm, you can use command line options:          -n ICON_NAME           To set the icon label          -T WINDOW_TITLE        To set the window title          -title WINDOW_TITLE    Equivalent to -T WINDOW_TITLE   2) You can use escape sequences to change things on the fly:      The basic escape sequence is:  ESC ] <P> ; <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> BEL      where ESC and BEL are the ASCII ESCAPE and BELL characters,     <P> is an ASCII decimal digit -- '2', '1', or '0', depending     on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title,     or both, and <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> is your desired label string.      Hence, this command will set the window & icon title:          echo ""\033]0;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c""       To set just the icon title:          echo ""\033]1;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c""       To set just the window title:          echo ""\033]2;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c""       Of course, you may have to fiddle with exact syntax,     depending on how the echo command works on your system     and what shell you are using (I've shown System-V semantics     under Bourne or Korn shells).      [Hint for Sun OS users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of     /bin/echo or Csh's built-in echo.

"I'm working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding  standard colormaps.  these colormaps.""  I wonder what window manager the writer had  in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.  Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.   However, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid  conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard  colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.   So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very  problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps  if every application used standard colormaps, things would  be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use  standard colormaps.  Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation,  XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent  with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.      According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):      For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and      base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.       To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:              (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF      XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is      used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c     to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the      call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is      specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the      total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59%      of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.     Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation      to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.      When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap,      defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult,      and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3,      one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored."	0
" I used to think this way, and not just about X. For example, incorrect English constructs such as ""its raining"" or ""it's window id"" annoy me. However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that ""color"" is more or less correct than ""colour"" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as ""XAllocColor"" and ""colormap"".  In a world that uses the term ""Windows"" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept ""X Windows"" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, ""the X Window System"" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (""X"" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called ""Microsoft Windows"" or ""the Microsoft Window System"" or how about just plain ""Microsoft""!  To summarise (or should that be ""summarize"") the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be ""windowing system""). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. "	0

  The protocol has to move the whole image from process memory to server memory, this is the hog. The conversions in the XPutImage() are fast.   Yes, by utilizing the MIT-SHM extension, that provides an XPutImage derivate that uses shared memory. Fine fast.   No. You can still XPutImage all of the frames onto pixmaps (thus moving them to server memory) and then replay them fastest using XCopyArea() BUT be aware, this is a major server memory bummer ! 	0

" Okay, that's good.  I'm typing this from exactly the same setup. (US-UNIX layout keyboard)  I did install the sunkbd patch, though.   Make sure you're using ""ssetroot"", which comes with tvtwm.  When tvtwm starts up, it nukes the existing root window.  Use an ""ssetroot"" after tvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a ""(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&"") You can also use ""VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename"" or just VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey.   Did you install the sunkbd patch?  It's in the contrib directory on export. All the keys on my keyboard send events properly, except the following: The End, PageUp, PageDown on the 6-key cluster aren't recognized. Even the compose key works.  (Though I can't seem to get the composed characters in an xterm to get passed.)  Anyone have a fix for the last two?  --Dave"	0
A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation. When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.     Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?	0
 Actually, info@qdeck.com is our customer service department. If you have technical questions, you can write to support@qdeck.com.   I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network itself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell file servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each segment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.  But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have 10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.  Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also...)	0
X Window installation on a Sun4/470 with CG6 alone and with CG2 as screen:0.0 and CG6 as screen:0.1.  Questions: 1)  Are there any hardware configuration changes on the CG2 and/or CG6 devices that need to be made other than pulling out and inserting the CG2 frame buffer in the vme bus?  2)  The CG6 is called a 'graphics accelerator' as apposed to a 'frame buffer'. What is the significance of this to the X server and how do we install the SunOS driver / X to be compatable.  ----------------------- I would appreciate any information on this.

"Help: I am running some sample problems from O'Reilly volume 4, Xt Intrisics Programming Manual, chapter 3. popup dialog boxes and so on.  In example 3.5, page 76 : ""Creating a pop-up dialog box""  The application creates window with a button ""Quit"" and ""Press me"". The button ""Press me"" pops up a dialog box. The strange feature of this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the first time. If I try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd, 4th .... time),  it is *much* slower.  Has anyone any experience with these sample programs, or why I get this behaviour - fast response time for the first time but slow response time from 2nd time onwards ? Anyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time they popup in reasonable fast response time ?"	0

"  The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators, and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately, the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case: ""Ctrl Any<Key>q"".   This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If you're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations.   If you mean ""menu accelerator"", no it's not possible.  That's according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.   I can't think of a reason why not.   There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).  For example,    applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade        -- filePulldown - openPushbutton          - exitPushbutton    *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O   *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O   *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q   *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q    *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\n\     Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\     Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)  You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.  I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I described above should work."	0

 Standard colormaps were spec'd with the intention that window managers would make them available. This doesn't mean that every window manager author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and implemented this at top priority.  The ESGE server we ship makes the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP available at startup. It doesn't wait for window managers to do it.   Does your hardware have only one CLUT? Since standard colormaps typically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoid displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one CLUT.  I don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather, colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the same standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a full color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it's called under X11R5).  If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default colormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into that colormap. If you can't do that, then you'll get flashing on a one hw CLUT framebuffer.  Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your client, this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps? -- 	0

Hi !  I am using Xview 3.0 on a Sparc IPX under Openwindows along with a XVideo board from Parallax which enables me to use 24 bit color. I am having some problems utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter.  I use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use to display live video. My video input is 24 bit color.  The problem is that my top level frame created as  frame = (Frame) xv_create(NULL,FRAME,NULL); seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas.  I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits. I tried using the following Xlib code :  XVisualInfo visual_info; int depth = 24; Colormap colormap; XSetWindowAttributes attribs; unsigned long valuemask = 0; Window *win; Xv_opaque frame;  win = xv_get(frame,XV_XID); XMatchVisualInfo(display,screen,depth,TrueColor,&visual_info);  /* So far so good */  colormap = XCreateColormap(display,win,visual_info,AllocNone);  /* It dies here with a BadMatch error :( */  attribs.colormap = colormap; valuemask |= CWColormap; XChangeWindowAttributes(display,w,valuemask,&attribs); XSetWindowColormap(display,win,colormap);   Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ?  Thanks in advance for any help that I can get. I would prefer a response via email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay.  Thanks again,   Alok.	0
   The MIT tapes come with documentation written by Keith Packard on the Shared   Memory Extension to X. Look in:  mit/doc/extensions/mit-shm.ms   I found this invaluble. Unfortunately, there is a bit of work to set up the   shared memory segments, making an XImage from it, etc. Also, there is an   extension query to determine if the server supports it, but you still need to   test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled   in the kernel. I have written layers of convience routines which make all this   transparent.   As for the XView code, well, I doubt that would be considered interesting.   The interesting stuff is done in a C object library. People interested in this   code can Email me.      Regards,	0
" There is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the display device can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory, and if so, how efficiently the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen memory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!).    I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to  main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the F.B. followed by a write)  If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OS's implementation of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also then just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device.  One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you don't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them.  One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation, there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., ""kill"").  You have to  be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.   Ken"	0

X  X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST: X  X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X  X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that mearly works X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language. X    (see ""The New Hacker's Dictionary"" by Eric Raymond) X  X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical  X    closing date for contests are in early May. X  X    The contest rules are posted to comp.unix.wizards, comp.lang.c, X    misc.misc, alt.sources and comp.sources.d.

 I ran in to this problem I while ago, and from what I remember you should use XtTranslateCoordinates etc. after realizing the main widget to calculate the location of the popup, then use something like XtVaSetValues on the popup widgets before ever using them.  Calling SetValues repeatedly (e.g. every time something pops up) seems to be what slows you down.  I never delved deep enough to figure out exactly why though...  --------------------------- Jeremy Payne UIUC Neuroscience program / College of Medicine jrpayne@uiuc.edu (217)244-4478	0
: I'd appreciate any feedback on capture/playback tools for use with X clients.  : Any comparisons/comments on regression testing tools would be great - : particularly XTM, XRunner, Autotester, and SRI's CAPBAK, SMARTS and EXDIFF.  How about starting where I could find ANY of these.  For the commercial ones, at least a phone number would be appreciated. 	0
"   As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  ""multi-headed"" tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg, a Sun with a cg4 display).  ""multi-screen"" and ""multi-display"" would, if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning of ""multi-display"" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing ""multi-screen"" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.  ""zaphod"" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the screen.   There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation inherent to X.  What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing about X.       der Mouse"	0

I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some problems.  Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question, because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.  Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :   typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)  but in several places in the HP source code, they reference the insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one, as the prototype suggests.  For example:   (*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)  Now, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments are passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to how to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h, or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.  Many thanks in advance for any help. 	0
Another company, Congruent Corporation of New York City, has also ported Xlib Xt and Motif 1.1 over to MS Windows NT, which provides full client development for X applications in an NT environment.  If you are porting InterViews over to MS Windows, I thought InterViews was a C++ toolkit with C++ classes. If that is so, how can it be built on Xlib, unless the classes are calling Xlib functions?

Is there aything available for X similar to QuicKeys for the Macintosh -- something that will allow me to store and playback sequences of keystrokes, menu selections, and mouse actions - directing them towards another application?  If so, could someone send me information on its availability -- and if not, how hard do we think it might be to send input to other X applications and, hopefully, deal with their responses appropriately?  (If an application is going to take a few seconds to process I probably have to wait  for it to complete before sending another command.)  thanks,	0

Does XDM work with DECnet? I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP and DECnet. I have a number of X-terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also running TCP/IP and DECnet.

If you use xsizehints->flags = PPosition | PSize, this tells the window manager that the values are prefered values of the program, not the user. I don't know a window manager that doesn't place the window like you prefer if you specify the position and size like above.  Greetings from Berlin,	0

   I think you will find that the active Linux and 386BSD communities are   populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying *any* money for software.   Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix.   An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always   available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I'm not   really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting   (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come   out, people like to rebuild their entire systems.

We've developed a number of applications using DevGuide and found it to  be a very useful tool. I've been impressed with the level of integration it affords using the connection editor. I love the general ease of use.    I talked with Tali Aben at Sun today about DevGuide + Motif. She was very helpful. We provided some input as to what we'd like to see in the next version of DevGuide. Tali was very enthusiatic about our comments. I mentioned I was going to post this email message and she offered to receive additional comments from the net on what DevGuide should evolve into.     Send your comments/wish-list, raving, et. al. about DevGuide to:    Tali.Aben@Sun.COM    Pretty cool example of a company that cares what we want.... More of this and computers may have a future.   Frankly, I like the idea that it will offer some migration capability to DOE/DOMF through an integrated ToolTalk capability, pointed out in March's  SunExpert magazine. 	0
  Yes.   Look up XV_DEPTH.  Also, you might want to try using XView colormap segments instead of Xlib for your colormap stuff.  They will probably be easier for you to use, and since you are using a TrueColor visual, you won't be losing anything compared to straight Xlib. 	0

Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence ""ESC [ 1 B 7""  would indicate that the ""HOME"" key was pressed, with the shift key down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such as ""shift-Return"".  If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file ""x11term.c"".  Maybe if someone at OSF is  interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about  emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods  somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.  Notes:    * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create    its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which     includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.   * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2    [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are    in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could     easily be adapted for anything else. "	0
Hi there netters,  I require a window to appear at a co-ordinates (0,0) (top left corner) of my screen (root window). Could some windows guru out there help me on how to go about doing this. I write the whole program which creates the window with the image it displays - I require the image to appear at the top-left corner so that I can grab it for recording on to video, using a MIniVas controller, which expects the window at the same spot every time.

If you're willing to do a little work, you can make DrawnButtons do what you want, more-or-less. One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that in our internal LYMB system.  We have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of dial positions from a single set of vectors. Each set of vectors is then drawn into a pixmap. Clicking the button advances the knob's state and changes to the next pixmap in the sequence.  Using DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular portion of the parent widget, but that's normally not a big shortcoming. You can make things look circular enough. 	0
Hi netters,  I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field. In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters, in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by  PANEL_MAX_VALUE!   As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit:   /* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,   * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes   */  PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL = PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,    152),  PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH = PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,   182),  which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and return value 0.  Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me, and clear this problem?  Any help is very much appreciated.  Yuri	0
 At Robert Gordon University, programming was the main (most time-consuming)  start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects: Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000  assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and  Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea). The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company  for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special  Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).   The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering  (C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing  Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where  students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an  outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change  suddenly).   In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and  exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a  30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework  assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?  BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by Honours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-).

I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was able to help me.  The problem is that main_win.win is doing fine, but when I create detail_win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until main_win.win receives an event. Here are the relevent calls:  main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,                 main_win.line_thick, fg, bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,                 main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint); main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win); XMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win); The event mask for main_win is:         PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask |         EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask; The flags are         PPosition | PSize  I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values): detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,                 detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,                 detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint); detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win); Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.   If anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win are not received until main_win.win receives an event I'd love to hear from them. Other that that everything works great so there must be some detail I'm overseeing.  Thanks for any tips ---> Robert rgasch@nl.oracle.com	0

[stuff delete]  Hear! Hear! I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at the moment.)  I don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced.  All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on UNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than DOS). 	0
I have a problem when I'm using PostScript. When I am working local on a SUN SPARCstaton IPC the PostScript works good, but when I connect to the SUN from a X-terminal I just get error messages that the PostScript cannot connect to the news-display.   Why doesn't PostScript work on an X-terminal?   Is there any way to make it work? 	0
"We recently got an NCD X-terminal to evaluate. This is running XRemote over a serial line. I wanted to get some measurement of response time, so I wrote a small Xlib program which simply creates a window, maps it and sends the first Expose  event to itself. The program times the delay from sending the event, to  receiving it.  I thought this was the simplest way to test client/X-server  round-trip delays. It's a similar concept to the ping(8C) program.  Is this a valid test to perform ? I've also tried the xbench program, available from ftp.uu.net, which bombards the server with graphics operations, but I  just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is ""acceptable"" interactive  response time. Has anyone got any ideas on this subject ?  Thanks. Andrew. (afielden@mlsma.att.com) "	0

I was having the same problems compiling X11R5 on a IPC sunos 4.1.3. If you compile with 'make -k World' it will not stop on the ld errors. As was stated in another post the clients with the errors still run correctly.	0
I'm writing 'xwall', a simple X version of 'wall', and I want it to put a message up on each of a default list of displays.  The problem is that XOpenDisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently controlled by xdm (login screen).   I've been through the manuals and FAQ and don't see a simple way to see if a display is 'openable' ahead of time, or to get XOpenDisplay to fail after a short period of time.  Any hints, suggestions, clues, or pointers to info?  Thanks... 	0

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) =====================================================================  I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?  1. Free options  The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.  Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will  be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86  is listed below.   X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was  done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).  It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.  There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,  X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you  don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).  X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).  2. Commercial options       1) Metro Link  2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?  3. What is XFree86?     XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with    X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and    other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:      1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,        selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require        an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of        1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by        default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield        up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.     2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default        operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now        equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately        20% faster than X386 1.2.     3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,        or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4        with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from        SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.     4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.        Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about        the ATI and Trident drivers.     5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's        code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).     6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is        compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the        contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.     7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font        renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary        distributions.     8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.     9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA        cards is now included.     The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2    (they were not in XFree86 1.1):      1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of        available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200         (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).     2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the        monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a ""two        headed"" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only        been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).     3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.     4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to        consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for        more information.)     5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some         versions of these devices were not previously compatible).     6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor        timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous        documentation and a lot of experimentation).     7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including        implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many         vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more         information).     8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has        been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of        0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks        line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.     9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig        configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative        and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new        options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)         manual page for more information on the format of this file).         Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file        in the source distribution for full details.     Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the    current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.  4. What OSs are supported?      XFree86 supports:  SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2  SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC  SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2  Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1   BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active  BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.   Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,  but anyone should feel free to submit patches.  If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to  xfree86@physics.su.oz.au  5. What video hardware is supported?     At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:   Tseng ET4000  Tseng ET3000  Paradise PVGA1  Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of   the PVGA1, and use its driver)  Genoa GVGA  Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000  ATI 18800, 28800   All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,  with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in  256 color mode.   The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of  video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the  ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome  server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.   It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to  non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To  avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86  1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel  clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are  discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how  these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such  a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with  future XFree86 releases.   If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,  it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the  Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not  work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.  In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond  products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions  of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).  If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.   Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA  video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the  CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It  could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset  on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot  of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested  theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not  working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86  working fine on them.  6. What about accelerated boards?   At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards  like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available  in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).   An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact  <hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.   A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>  or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.  7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?   The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the  16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory  contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-  planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each  of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-  buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled  16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code  could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).  But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer  implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,  but nothing is yet available from the project.  8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?   Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run  X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.  The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending  on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).  To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will  be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable   lower bound.  9. Where can I get source for XFree86?   Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22  from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:   export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)   ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)   ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)  (For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)   Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information  on which files you need to get to build your distribution.  10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?   Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:   ftp.physics.su.oz.au  - SVR4 binaries    under /XFree86/SVR4   ftp.win.tue.nl   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   ferkel.ucsb.edu   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/SVR4/XFree86   stasi.bradley.edu  - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   blancmange.ma.utexas.edu - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/ISC   ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86   tsx-11.mit.edu   - Linux binaries    under /pub/linux/packages/X11   agate.berkeley.edu  - 386BSD binaries    under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86   ftp.cs.uwm.edu   - Mach binaries    under /i386   Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may  archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will  contain a README file that describes what files you need to take  from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were  made when building the distribution.  IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?  11. Installation directories   The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot  (/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include  files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.   This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified  via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is  nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed  alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.  12. Configuration files   The XFree86 server reads a configuration file (""Xconfig"") on startup.  The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in  the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.  13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes   David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known  clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.  The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and  is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is  also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on  export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated  occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the  settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to  David for inclusion in the database.   If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file   with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.  It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use  this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information  to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.   NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and        is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot        clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from        your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The        server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.        You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your        Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up        starting the server in the future.  14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit   If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to  reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is  fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.  V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?   First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).  15. SVR4  Why won't my xterm run properly?   If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define  CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.  csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'   The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping  problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be  installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.  16. SVR3   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.  17. 386BSD   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.   Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey  <Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the  file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:       agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2  18. Linux   You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc  jump libraries installed.   Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.   If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to  run the server as ""X -pn"". The default startup configuration assumes  that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files  /usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the  -pn argument to X386.   Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major  number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not  owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit  console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but  startx won't.   When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with  a tty, for example ""xdm < /dev/console &"".   For more detailed information, please read the file README present  with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.  19. Mach   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.  VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?   This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is  fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.  Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.  VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?  20. BSD compatibility library   A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.  The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a  which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),  seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include  <X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro  definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are  linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these  functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a  21. ANSICCOPTIONS   This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the  ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite  the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see  something like   CCOPTIONS=""-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings""  and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put   CCOPTIONS=""-O2 -fwritable-strings""  in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of   ANSICCOPTIONS=""-ansi""   CCOPTIONS=""-O2 -fwritable-strings""  and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:   ANSICCOPTIONS=  to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death  with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because  CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must  add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.  XFree86 Contact Information      Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86     Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of:   The original ""gang of four"":   David Dawes <dawes@physics.su.oz.au>   Glenn Lai <glenn@cs.utexas.edu>   Jim Tsillas <jtsilla@damon.ccs.northeastern.edu>   David Wexelblat <dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com>   Those supporting non-SYSV operating systems:   Robert Baron <Robert.Baron@ernst.mach.cs.cmu.edu> [Mach]   Rich Murphey <Rich@Rice.edu> [386BSD]   Orest Zborowski <obz@kodak.com> [Linux]      e-mail sent to <xfree86@physics.su.oz.au> will reach all of the core team.   --------------------------------------------------  Thanks to all the people who already sent me corrections or additions, especially David Wexelblat (one of the major contributors of updates)."	0

I'm running X under openwindows 3.  Normal X programs not having a font specified always show up in the same font - until I change the fontpath, and restart windows - then a new default font is used until the next change.  I can't seem to figure out how it chooses.  Is there some way to set this?  Possibly something in .Xdefaults???  Please reply in direct email - I summarize.	0
Dear Xperts,  I'm developing an application that uses a Motif slider to select an image file out of a directory. Now I would like to display the name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale button (i.e. with the MB1 pressed). As XmNshowValue only displays the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding image file name, I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to do the mapping between the scale value and the file name:  XtAddEventHandler(scaleImage,Button1MotionMask,  FALSE, SliderMoved, NULL);   and in the eventhandler do a:    while (XCheckTypedWindowEvent (display, event->window, MotionNotify, &Return))    ;   XmScaleGetValue(scaleImage,&value);   /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/   However, when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks, with of co    urse a null effect as my MB1 is not pressed to move the scale button. So what is goin    g wrong? Or is the a wrong approach to this problem? Any hints are highly appreciated.	0
I am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system.  In keeping with more classic command and control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.   I have a number of X level questions regarding this:  (We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be  predominantly Sun's, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).  I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens, and not multiple X displays.   Given this:   - Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple  as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's  nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between  screens?   - Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate  screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?  What are they; who sells them...   - Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a  window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?   - Is there any way for the application to transparently see  multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware  only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?   - Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a  system capable of using either multiple screens or a single  screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate  multiple screens instead)?    I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely  on providing config files which will specify for each  configuration the screen placement of each window in the  application.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience  are more than welcome. 	0

 To incrementally update the contents of windows, I use the following trick:   1. Set the window background to None,  2. Call XClearArea(display, window, 0, 0, 0, 0, True),  3. Restore the window background to its correct value.  The call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background, but still generates exposure events for visible parts of the window.  In order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled incrementally (something is already displayed on the screen and may need to be erased), I encapsulate the 3 operations with 2 self addressed client messages, which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server.  XGrabServer(display) client message (start-incremental)   background None  XClearArea  Restore background  client message (end-incremental) XUngrabServer(display)  The GrabServer prevents other events to be inserted by the server in the critical section. 	0
 code deleted...  From the XmTextField man page (during discussion of resources):     XmNverifyBell        Specifies whether a bell will sound when an action is reversed       during a verification callback.

"According to the OSF/Motif Style Guide, one should use cursor shapes to give the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him. So a ""hourglass"" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a ""caution"" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level. So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined for some windows, e.g. a ""crosswire"" cursor for a DrawingArea, things get even more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier, but is this so? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let me know. The topics on ""busy cursors"" in the several FAQ's are not helpful, since they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window attribute set to 'None'."	0
"        [Hint for Sun OS users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of        /bin/echo or Csh's built-in echo.

 They aren't functions, they are character arrays. The standard strings are either defined as string constants or character pointers into XtShellStrings and XtStrings determined by XTSTRINGDEFINES. Your libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it undefined so simply recompile one or the other. It is probably worth adding -DXTSTRINGDEFINES to your CFLAGS.  --   Michael Salmon  #include <standard.disclaimer> #include <witty.saying> #include <fancy.pseudo.graphics>	0
" I think that Mike Foligno was the captain of the Sabres when he got traded to the Leafs. Also, wasn't Rick Vaive the captain of the Leafs when he got traded to Chicago (with Steve Thomas for Ed Olcyzk and someone). Speaking of the Leafs, I believe that Darryl Sittler was their captain (he'd torn the ""C"" off his jersey but I think he re-claimed the captaincy later on) when he was traded to the Flyers.

      Here is my traditional experience with tickets, playoffs and otherwise, at the Civic Arena.       Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena.  Best  strategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E. Taylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45, when the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.       Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on;  what's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).  Others can add on their opinions as well.	0

Hello Hockey fans. Bonjour tout le monde!  Well, in Salt Lake City this past Sunday, the local ABC station decided not to televise the hockey games.  La directrous de programme est la tete de merde! Anyway, I have a satellite dish, and a few of my friends from hockey have invited themselves over to watch the games this coming Sunday (25 Apr), and I can not find correct game times.  For the Calgary at LA game I have times showing everything from 11:00 AM MDT, to 5:00 PM MDT.  I am not even sure what games are going to be played this coming Sunday, now that ABC has mucked up the schedule.  I think I should be able to pull in three games (11:00 am, 2:00 pm, and 5:30 pm MDT) off the dish, but I am not sure.  IF anybody has a schedule, pleas emial it to me.  As you can see, I have to telent to get rec.sport.hockey, and it is sometimes difficult to get a link.  Thanks in advance Merci d'avance  P.S.  Anglais ou francais d'accord.

"           Nice try Deepak, but ""tough Whaler squad"" should have clued you in to the fact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek.  If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is only for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with injuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really rather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this for sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I don't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically human attitudes.    With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing  money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff ""take"" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely to consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are going to come back with ""winning spirit"" and all of that crap but these players are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the  game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make a decent living.   Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is  being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.  The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions of the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top  after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and ""hot"".  The  emphasis on the playoffs, with their ""sudden death"" appeal has been promoted by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh loses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the league over the year.  They proved it.  cordially, as always,  rm "	0

  Close Roger, but no banana, er avocado or is it artichoke ?!?   Geracie in the Murky News said Kingston will be the new 49ers  quarterback.  I'm still trying to determine if he is kidding  or not :).  If I happen to pound down enuff pints sometime   this week I'll go back and check what stooper idiot Purdy  said in his column.  That ought to be worth a few Leafs, I  mean Laughs.   If I'm really depressed I'll read the SF Comicle.   mark   just say	0
   Hmmmm, I'm not sure this is true.  According to Mike Lang and good old Stagie, along with the rest of the TV crews in pittsburgh, they  winning streak could have stopped because it is a regular season mark. I would think this would also hold with an unbeaten streak for regular season games.	0
" It's just as meaningless to compare goals, assists, PIM and any other stat I can think of.  Each player is asked to take a unique role for his team.  The contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the same team or different teams.  And yet ... awards are given and promotions received based in part on these meaningless stats.  The operative words are ""in part"" - stats must be interpreted, tempered with other information one has about the player.      And comparing Jagr's and Francis's points is just as ridiculous and absurd... but not more ridiculous and absurd as comparing goals, assists, points, +\- for Selanne, Lindros, Juneau, Potvin, and the other rookies in the league... and yet...  How about looking at them for what they are and enjoy the game."	0
This game would have been great as part of a double-header on ABC or ESPN; the league would have been able to push back-to-back wins by Le Magnifique and The Great One.  Unfortunately, the only network that would have done that was SCA, seen in few areas and hard to justify as a pay channel. )-;  gld	0
Here is an update on the Goalie mask poll...  First, since so many people gave me their 3 best, I decided to give 3 pts for their favorite, 2 pts for 2nd, 1 for 3rd. If you e-mailed a response with only one, I gave it 3 pts. Please feel free to send me your 2 other favorites, if you only sent one before.   Also, votes are still welcome! Any mask you like will do, as I  have received votes for players not in the NHL. Please mention what team they play for, though.

Oh, excuse me for wasting the bandwidth, but I was referring to  the original incident, not the recent skirmish which occurred this past month.  	0
I agree. It was great for the ESPN people to show the Detroit game. (My roommate just about sh*t when they threw the octopus on the ice. (Thanks for explaining the significance of that BTW)) The only problem I had was when they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and music. Especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report. Other then that, hats off to ESPN. Now if they'll only make a habit of this. Yeah right! Baseball seasons started (Zzzzzz.....) =)  KOZ 	0
 Actually, this part was really interesting.  It turns out that the mask is custom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through a piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12 minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the goalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.   John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.    Yeah, Essensa's mask looked really good.    Actually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.  I would bet money on it either way...and it did look awesome! 	0

 Hopefully, a miracle (o.k. not quite a miracle, but close!) will occur and Pittsburgh will be elminated prior to the finals.  If they make it again,  they will probably keep the Cup.  If they don't, it's the Hawks' turn!  GO BLACKHAWKS!!  CONGRATS TO JEREMY ROENICK FOR BEING ONLY THE 2ND HAWKS PLAYER TO POST  BACK TO BACK 50 GOAL SEASONS!!	0
True rumor.  Fact!  A big three way deal!  Eric Lindros going to Ottawa Senators.  And Senators get $15mill from Montreal.  Montreal gets Alexander Daigle (the first round pick from Senators)  Philly gets Damphousse, Bellow, Patrick Roy and a draft pick. 	0
"#21 PETER AHOLA  Season: 2nd Acquired: '92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations Grade:  I (B)  It is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the Penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points); it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be ... Peter Ahola.  #24 DOUG WILSON  Season: 16th Acquired: '91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and   2nd round pick in '92 entry draft Grade:  I (B)  I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out. Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which, unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.  #29 DEAN KOLSTAD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (C-/D+)  It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games, he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.  #38 PAT MACLEOD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (?)  MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment, a ""rehab assignment"" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs. Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills.  #41 TOM PEDERSON  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+)  Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in 43 games.  However, his size (5' 9"", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically, on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach. But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.  #45 CLAUDIO SCREMIN  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (D+/D)  He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre."	0
 MLB is perfectly willing to take players from Cuba.  They just have to defect first.    Sort of like the situation used to be with Russian/Czech/etc hockey players, until the political situation in those countries changed.	0
  About 25 is correct for Numminen and Lumme.    No, Kurri's points are too low. 27 for Kurri and 28 for Sel{nne.     That's true. Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL. North-ame- ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average european player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better  skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL are mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league game is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many  breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in NHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because of clumsy defensemen.  I have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars aren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans are in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the class of his own). 	0

"        Depends on what you mean by classy. From what I've heard about him, he was about as classy as Harold Ballard.  Only difference was that back then almost all the owners were like that, so he seemed okay by comparison.  Read the book ""Net Worth"" for one view of what Smythe (and Norris and Adams and Campbell) were like.          Even more specifically, I think what Roger was saying (and I said it previously too) is that these are NOT the people who made the league great, so why should divisions, conferences etc. be named after them instead of Morenz, Vezina, Howe, Orr etc., the people who DID make it great.  Instead, the NHL has chosen to immortalize the men who got rich off of the men who made the game great.   "	0
All these people who send in their polls should take a closer look at NJD, they are a very deep team, with two very capable goalies, and excellent forwards and defensemen.

  Being a proud BU alumnus, I'd like to get a list of BU players in  the NHL so I can keep an eye on their progress. A lot of Terriers are graduating this year so I hope to see them soon in the NHL.

"By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff  At 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer. Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues.  The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing.  They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,"" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.  ``It wasn't pretty at the end,"" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did.""  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``It's a shame we let down,"" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.""  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,"" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.""  Some players didn't have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,"" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.""  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.  ``I didn't know it was final,"" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.""  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,"" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.""  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,"" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy.""  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,"" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in."""	0

"The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum Sunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0 shutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from mounting any serious attack.  Injuries:  Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.  Roster Moves:  Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS second pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years old, 6'4"", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals, 12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him up front as well.  Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period of the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win, and played again for Hershey Sunday night.  Lines:  Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Acton-Brown  Galley-McGill Yushkevich-Cronin Carkner-Hawgood Bowen  Tommy Soderstrom in goal.  Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.  Game Summary:  If the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this year. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after scoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.  Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal. He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side. A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a goal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.  Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept away every rebound.  After the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the net. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef Beranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.  The FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS from building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and defense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies were strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners. Then Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had a chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into him, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno was a little far from the boards, and Mike ""Mister"" McGeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at 15:38  The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were very aggressive (for a change) on the kill.  With time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark checked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and went right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside the blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.  The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric gloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was running out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal mouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where Recchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle, and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past Bobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at 117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.  Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on the power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with a slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most of the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers flared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton got a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell. Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich. Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point, and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as nobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net, but Soderstrom stoned him.  The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't get anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.  The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a little.  The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the period, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making road kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros  (unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing) all at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.  Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.  At about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the Leafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom stoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through Soderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout.  Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to set up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS zone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran his stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all. 5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches. Upward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got a couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O! Penalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski and Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.  So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest in stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and blasted it past Puppa at 18:39.  That was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa did, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the 3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star break. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in the NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't remember that he's tied with.  Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot be eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night in Washington would be the official end.  FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points in 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6 games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better than 5 under in 80).  Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th is 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS will win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and finish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the goal for the team to focus on.

  It is a long standing good luck Redwing's tradition to throw an octopus  on the ice during a Stanley Cup game. They say it dates back to '52 at the Olympia when the Wings became the 1st team (I think) to sweep  the cup in 8 games. A lot hardet to throw one from Joe Louis seats than from the old Olympia balcony, though.	0
"News reports in Toronto say that the Rangers are insisting that Kovalev, Zubov, and Andersson play for Binghampton in the Calder Cup playoffs, rather than return to play for their ""home"" countries in the World Championships.  ...shame on the Rangers.  Another black eye for the NHL in Europe."	0

 What?! White, yes. Well off, definitely not. Hockey season ticket owners have the lowest average income of any of the four major North American sports.  And think of where the majority of hockey players come from. From a farm out in Boondock, Saskatchewan or Weedville, Alberta.   The inner city isn't the only place that is poor. I think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is... no ICE to play on.          Stace 	0
"Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter of what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:  Canadians: 400 Americans: 100 Europeans: 100     Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.     Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like ""Bure"" ""Konstantinov"" and ""Borshevshky"". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec, and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well.       I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about ""Pavel Bure, the Russian Rocket"" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a Canucks fan to begin with ;-).       Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even better hockey players. It's all hype. This ""European mystique"" is sickening, but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.      With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly only getting worse.      I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.      I just don't want them on mine.       --  Richard J.

"On the Lindros ""trade"":  Like Ottawa would be stupid enough to get Lindros.  Why do you think Quebec traded him?  Lindros would go on personal strike again...maybe I should talk to Ottawa mgmt. about arranging such a trade....  ;-)  On that xenophobe:  Thankfully nobody agreed with him publicly.  Maybe we should look at baseball, the supposed ""American"" pasttime (sp?).  Look at all the damn Latin Americans playing there!  They should all be deported!  They aren't American!  (add sarcasm to taste)  To Roger:  Wow, for once we agree.  I hope this isn't a sign of things to come.... I'll become a ranting lunatic who talks about nothing but the Leafs being the best in the Campbell.  ;-)  On the Rangers:  I told someone that nothing that happened in the Patrick would surprise me anymore.  I lied.  How the hell can a team go into Washington, earn a shutout, then come back home and lose to pitiful Hartford?  The absolute *pinnacle* of mediocrity.  I can't stand it. From what I've read, the goalie is to blame this time, as Beezer played pretty poorly.  Smith is talking about calling up Corey Hirsch from Binghamton, everybody is pointing fingers... this is definitely not the same team which wanted to prove itself in Washington.  *Now* nothing that happens in the Patrick will surprise me.

"1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes and game reports. ------------------------------------------------- Kings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04/18/93  The third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary, against the second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front of a non-sellout crowd of 18,605 at the Saddledome in Calgary.  Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out- standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play  and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries.  The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the blue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the  Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex- pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to  the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this  morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.  1st period:  1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up in 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where Sydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the  hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.  Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings failed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert. Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30 second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period.  2nd period:  The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game.  1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit  the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated  down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him  and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.  2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play. Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot  where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.  3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot, beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.  4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.  Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at 12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they failed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high sticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The Kings hit 3 goal post in the period.  3rd period: The Kings used the phrase ""Initiate, not retaliate"" and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames  continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.  5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him, wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the crease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.  Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.  5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the  crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.  Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where  Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing  a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the  Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at  8:19) took penalties.    5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near  point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.  6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play to seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone  cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed  the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass,  beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.  At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he went after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames right out of the game.  On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey as they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing.  On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or the Flames will surely get that power play back on track.  Notes: ------ The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.  Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.  The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.  Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon  games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play over their last 9 games.  The teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.

  Wrong information. They just announced that Suhonen has made a deal with  Jokerit.  	0
from Anna Matyas:  Yeah, and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 35 minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the best defenseman in the league. I'd take a whole team of Chelioses if I could. (That way, when one got a penalty the others could kill it!)	0
 No problem, no offence taken ...   It is sad, just as a lover of the sport, that this team can be in the metro New York area for over a decade and still exist as just a non-entity ...   We're getting the Sabres-Bruins as the replacement game (and probably so are you) while the Devils-Penguins game is played on SCNY and the Islanders-Caps are the overflow game on the SCA (SCNY Plus).  If the Sabres-Bruins ends early then we'll go to the Devils-Penguins game (assuming that ESPN follows their previous patterns; we got the last minute of the Islanders-Rangers and all of the overtime two weeks ago).  ESPN's coverage started last night, by accident, but as one or more other writers have pointed out, they could've gone to wild hog wrestling for the evening instead ...  gld	0
 Pierre, For purposes of the tie breaker, you only count the first three games in each city. Therefore, Quebec cannot possibly be ahead of Montreal 4-3, and there's probably only one game that counts remaining between Boston and Quebec, which means Boston has probably already won.	0
   Hm, do you think Dusseldorf fans would like it if their team joined the NHL? Or do we have to include Koln as well (Cologne to you Anglophiles) to make  them happy?:-)  	0

I just overheard that San Jose Coach George Kingston was officially terminated today...  Maybe good news, maybe bad.  I kinda liked him, but he seemed to lack a certain fire. 	0
    How about Kevin Hatcher? Scored roughly 35 goals, plays 30 minutes a game.   That's really sad when two second-rate goalies (Barasso and Belfour) are the main contenders for the Vezina. Call me crazy, but how about Tommy Soderstrom - five shutouts for a 6th place team that doesn't really play defense. It's really unfortunate that the better goalies in the league (McLean, Essensa, Vernon) had unspectacular years. BTW, if you are going to award the Norris on the basis of the last 30 days, why not give the Vezina to Moog? He has been the best goalie over the past month.      Arbour or King. Burns will probably win, since playoffs aren't taken into consideration - he's OK in the regular season, but I'm not sure if he's beaten anyone other than Hartford in the playoffs.	0
boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report.  The Wings player was Yves Racine, and he returned later in that same period.	0
Here is yet another prediction for them great playoffs! (you may laugh at your convenience!) :)   Adams Division (I hate the NE (name) divisoin!!!)  BOS vs BUF   BOS in 5  (the B's are hot lately!)  MON vs QUE   MON in 7  (This will be the series to watch in the first round!)   BOS vs MON   MON in 7  (this may be a bit biased but I feel the Canadiens will          (smarten up and start playing they played two months ago    ( i.e. bench Savard !!!)  Patrick Division   PIT vs NJD   PIT in 6  (It wont be a complete cake walk... there be a few lumps    (in the cake batter!)  WAS vs NYI   WAS in 6   (This will not be an exciting series..IMO)   PITT vs WAS  PIT in 4   (Washington will be tired after the NYI)   Norris Division  CHI vs StL    CHI in 5   (StL will get a lucky game in)  TOR vs DET    TOR in 7   (THis , like MON vs QUE, will be another intense      (series to watch!)  CHI vs TOR    TOR in 7   (Potvin will be settling in nicely by this point.)   Smythe Division  VAN vs WIN     VAN in 5  (Teemu is great, but Vancouver better as a team!)  CAL vs LAK     CAL in 6  (Gretzky is great, but Calgary has been on fire lately)     ...sorry for the pun... um, no I am not! :)  VAN vs CAL     VAN in 6  (This will be a great series! but VAN has proven they     (Will not lie down and get beat!)   Wales Conference finals  Pittsburgh vs Montreal     Montreal in 6 (Montreal IMHO is the only team            (that has a chance against        Pittsburgh.)   Campbell Conference finals  Vancouver vs Toronto  Toronto in 6  (Potvin will be series MVP)    STANLEY CUP FINALS    Toronto Maple Leafs    vs    Montreal Canadiens      (The Classic Stanley Cup Final matchup!!) <---also a dream come true!   Montreal wins the Stanley cup in the 7th game 1 - 0 in double overtime. Roy and Potvin are spectacular throughout the series and share series MVP (if  that is possible) Vincent Damphouse nets game winner from a brilliant pass by Brian Bellows! Canadiens star(?) Denis Savard watched his buddies play from the owners box nursing that splinter on his thumb which has left him on the  disabled list since the first game of the playoffs (awww shucks).   ***************************************YEE HAA!!******************************* *poof* And I wake up :) Well that is my predictions...I hope and dream they come true. and you can stop laughing anytime :)	0
  These players all are pretty good players.  They are the depth that the dynasties had to win Stanley Cups.  They tend to be the very good second line guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL. They were all important to their clubs.  Probably, several of these Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it were not for the depth provided by these players.  They compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins.  Very good players who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) who provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL.  As a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That doesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians had at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could dominate games with his defence.  He didn't need to get goals to dominate. He shut down the opposition and was thus valuable.  There has never been anyone any better at doing this.  Not ever.	0
 No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is the reason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides, Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.  Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more).  Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than  five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME  ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to  play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.  Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this article, if possible.   I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who) in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in regardless.   Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second, IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.  Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red  Army.    But I still hate the team.  On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit.  Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New Jersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is unbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I  hate that team anyway.  	0
I got back from my trip to discover that my email spool file got blown away.  I am missing all the playoff pool entries sent between April 5 and April 17.  It looks like about 200 entries got lost.  *Sigh*.  Therefore, I would like to ask each person that sent me a team to resend it ASAP.  I am relying on your honesty to not make changes after the deadline today.  Thanks in advance, and I apologize for the problem.  --  Andrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com HP IDACOM Telecom Operation     | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253	0
    on  How many players of international class an average NHL team has. 6-10? Top players just play more in smaller rinks. Is the quality of European hockey really poor, then recent years only few north-american (usually good farm  players) players have got place in Finnish league or Elitserien, while most  have been shipped back. 	0
" Press conference at 1PM ...   Interestingly, Keenan's co-coach (or is it his ""Number One""?) on Team Canada at the World Championships is Roger Neilsen.    It'd be interesting if the Rangers call in the balance of Neilsen's contract to be Keenan's assistant ...  Roger did do a very good job with the mediocre players, just as he handled the Cinderella Canucks of 10 years ago ... but his mistake was playing the Rangers like those Canucks last May ...  gld"	0
Us easterners who have newspapers with editors unsympathetic to playoff pools, often don't get summaries from west coast games since they finish too late at night for the morning edition.  I (and I'm sure others too) would greatly appreciate it if scoring summaries of west coast playoff games could be posted to this group right away. basically, all we need are goal scorers and assists, don't bother with times, penalties, shots etc...  this would make a lot of pool-obsessed people very happy.  I guess with the Senators out golfing now, the  local papers have lost interest.  ;-)  thanks.  kd. 	0
"Well, I gotta tell ya,  last night's Leafs game vs the Devils was a nail-bitter LET ME TELL YOU! It was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to the Don and Ron it was the an ""off-night"" for the Leafs and the Devils  were outplaying Toronto. Well, I BEG to differ....  IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the credit away from Gilmour).  I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY?  Well first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet, Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs fare when they are once again ""healthy"" if they are playing this well so far??  Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence, moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost at home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc. (BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't  remember him having any as of yet.)  Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and Toronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to see this one?)  Coming to the stretch and still a ROAR'IN!!!!! Go LEAFS Go!!!!"	0
"                           ^^          Funny you should mention it...this is exactly the case I was going to make.   I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks.  But this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase  will last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking one.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support them.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.     Ok.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book.    You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that it wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e. a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And before anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back and read from where this thread started...  It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly found an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it ""gee, Mario Lemieux is amazing, I'll go watch him play"", or was it ""gee, now we've got a *kick* *ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play"".  I think it was the latter.   I don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to the games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket holders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings initial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source) and corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.    Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since Gretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler dynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like McNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the Forum even if the tickets were sold.   For the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they make people around them better.   Well, at least we are in full agreement here!   So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>   Yes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without Selanne."	0

 First,Happy Birthday,Val. Second, ESPN's affinity with Patrick has probably more to do with the travel/production costs for a once a week NHN(National Hockey Night) affair.(ESPN-ABC owner,Capital Cities, is a company known for being quite thrifty with minimal overhead costs. It's quite possible that Jim Schoenfeld may be working for doughnuts :-).  Gary Thorne and Bill Clement are both NJ-based and the rest of ESPN crew resides in the suburban CT with a very close proximity to tri-state area. Plus,it makes sense in terms of solid hockey following in the NorthEast corridor(PA-NY-NJ-DC/Maryland). Whereas,in the Adams you have only 3-American based teams, out of which 2(Buffalo and Hartford) are not in Top-20  US TV-markets.	0

According to the hockey gurus over at ESPN, should the Islanders win tonite the two teams will have the same record, but the Devils will be playing the Penguins.  This is because the Islanders have won the season series against the Devils.  I think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include:  1.  season series 2.  goals against 3.  goals for  in this order (correct me if I'm wrong).  Anyone have anything to add?  Craig	0

"  Punch Imlach's contributions as a coach and GM were far greater than those of the above combined.  Should we name a division or trophy after him?  Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they were powerful owners.  As owners they certainly did help to build the league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether. Are we going to honour those who contributed to the league's evolution or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the  sport itself?      I can't disagree with you here.    What have you heard?  The Major was the *definitive* little asshole!  He originated the phrase ""if you can't beat 'em in the alley you can't beat 'em on the ice.""  That was his idea of hockey.  Do you think, by chance, that Don Cherry is a classy individual?   The money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on, and that is: ""it is the players that are what make the game great and not the people who put them on the ice""  Exactly true.  Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch is the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame.  I have always thought that this was nonsense.   -- "	0
 Wales Conference, Adams Division, Semifinal  I'm hoping for a Fuhr miracle, but I agree that Boston will likely win the series.  Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal (Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely (not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one of my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.   Agreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or does everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!  Final  I can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for 6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play in the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear territorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will not be putting money on this series. :-)    Agreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent of the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is credit to NY.   Agreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent team, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.   I think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't think it will go six either...*maybe* five.   If Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They own the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once again I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the Habs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.    Chicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good, IMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.   Very true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out why Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three  at MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.   It _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all.  And yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.    Our first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their size *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team chasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.   This is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough.  I don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a non-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate Gretzky.  LA in six.   If it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be LA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.   Wow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked LA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.   If Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet against the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong because they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose, though, I'd have to take the Penguins.  A side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than Gilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from the age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team. I'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge), Gilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp. from Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best all-round players in the NHL.  	0

" Before I begin lambasting Don Cherry, let me first say that I've been sort of a Cherry fan for a while...admittedly stuff he says has to be taken lightly, but he's more-or-less harmless.  On Saturday, however, he crossed the lines of good taste:   This is the best he can do?!!  Gee Don, tremendous amounts of professionalism here.  The CBC looks just as bad as he looks foolish letting him get away with this nonsense...making fun of names??  It's bad enough that he makes asinine blanket statements about European players, but he's now resorted to making fun of their names too?  He sounded like an idiot, much like he did last week when he said that Teemu would never make it to his 'Rock 'em, Sock 'em' video until he dropped the gloves...   Well, what he _said_ was that even though he's been around the league for quite some time, he still doesn't know who's where w.r.t. conference and division names.  HELLO??!! McFly??  The names have been around for a couple of decades or so....he also invited the audience to ""Name the teams in the Wales...quick, quick!"" Followed by ""Ah, you don't know, I don't know....""    Sorry Don.  Wrong on this one.   This was absolutely hilarious.  Don's argument about the basketball and baseball brawls was fairly good...unfortunately he neglected to mention the fines that were levelled in the NBA case.  Serious money...oh well, he's never been one for objectivity, has he?  Don's question to Gretzky: "	0
 This brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned that the NHL could expand in Europe.  Would most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing to play for a team in Europe?  I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level. (I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player)  When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember these:  - Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons) - Nicholls ... in Edmonton. - R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only. - C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.  I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:  - Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french   fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One   players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could   not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.  Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved to London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league (2 years ago?)  I wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe.  Myself I would like to see some European teams, but what would be  the best way to do it? 	0
How long has Don Cherry been a student at SFU? (or is that Arche Bunker?)  Please, keep this racist drivel off of the net.  You're an embarassment to Canadians everywhere.	0
It is really annoying to see all of these predictions on the Net.  Who really cares who you think will win?  Please stop with the predictions, we all know the Caps are going to win the Cup, so let it go at that. 	0
Here are the final stats for the CHL for the 1992-1993 season.                         Central Hockey League                         5840 S. Memorial Drive                              Suite 205                           Tulsa, OK  74145                        Phone:  (918) 664-8881                        Fax:    (918) 664-2215  Founder and President - Ray Miron Commissioner - Monte Miron Marketing Director - Jim Goodman Information Director - Eric Kolb  Each team is owned by the league, with local intrests controlling day to day operations.  Working agreements and NHL affiliations are up to each team.  Each team has a $100,000 salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up).  Each team is limited to 11 visas, meaning at least 6 players must be Americans (Ignore this rule if you are Tulsa, they only had 2 Americans on the roster during the playoffs).  Teams play in Wichita, Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Memphis, Fort Worth, and Dallas.  Future expansion plans include Houston, San Antonio, Baton Rouge, Little Rock, El Paso, Albuquerque, Tuscon, and Amarillo.  Austin is a possibility if Dallas has to move.  Houston and San Antonio are in for this fall, with Baton Rouge and Little Rock likely for 94-95.

Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL,  allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two  regular-season games.  Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at  the end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday, April 11.  But the league  didn't rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received.  The  Stars recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in  Kalamazoo, Mich., to replace Churla.  The above is courtesy of The Washington Times on-line service.  Now, here's where I need help.  If anyone out there has a tape of Tuesday's Chicago-Minnesota game, please contact me.  Terms will be favorable.  Also, if anyone can tape tonight's Minnesota-Detroit game, please contact me.  This could be quite important.  Once again, I will make it worth your trouble.  Thanks to all. 	0

" Well, actually now that you mention it, a few weeks ago the CBC ran a documentary on ""Ice Hockey in Harlem"".  the Canadian Club of New York (something like that) sponsors a league for kids in Harlem and based on the TV report they all seemed to be having a lot of fun.  All playing with regular equipment, jerseys, etc etc, on a proper outdoor rink.  It looked just like kids playing hockey anywhere else."	0

 Let's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd take Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1 netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than that after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records are similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.  You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well be, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in those games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh, the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.   But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just my opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that about Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm batting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.  As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the save.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't get the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's what the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him.   I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending champs.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are part of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.  Anyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and I'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current 7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I don't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any tickets next season:-).	0
    This is known as the Savard syndrome - and we are talking Denis, not Serge. No team will ever win squat with the likes of Denis Savard in their lineup.   They could tell Savard to stay home and watch the games on TV.    Sounds like #12 to me.  cordially, as always,   rm 	0

 My votes (FWIW):  Team MVP: Pat Verbeek. He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has  36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and Mark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than MVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.  Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season as a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+ points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew Cassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23 and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing,  although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the right side.  Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77 point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate, since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it). Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his way out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the  Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar after signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of competence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row.	0

" Well, since the Oilers didn't win a heck of a lot of games, I'm not sure they deserve and MVP (""can't win without him"").  However, I'd suggest Kelly Buchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for the All-Star game notwithstanding.  As for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations this year due to his ""breakthrough"" year (for him) last year, so he didn't really raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the callups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on the team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league oblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli. I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.  As for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers dumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or even Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.  --  Andrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com HP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253"	0

 But ultimately their hockey philosophies are like night and day... Keenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the initiative (within the limits of his system)...while Roger has a reactive hockey philosophy...which is why Messier will be able to and has played for Keenan, but thought Roger's way was a sure loser.   Roger is a great assistant coach...but considering what must be bad blood between Nielson and Messier, it would be a mistake to bring him back even in that role.	0
"Ditto...  If we allow people like him to continue to do what he does, it's a shame.  People say that cheap shots and drawing penalties by fake- ing is part of the game, I say ""Bullsh-t!"".  If he ever tried some like that on a Yzerman, he'd would have to deal with Probert now wouldn't he?  What Ulf does isn't even retaliatory!  There's now way one could justify what he does and if they do they're fools. "	0

I think it might be 20.  : R-Teemu Selanne.....27 :  Compared to Kurri, Selanne's points are too high, lets make it 25 or 26.   : well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of : Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's : presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at : the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be : that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.  Wow, now, it looks like you don't like our players? What about guys like: Nieminen, Jutila, Riihijarvi, Varvio, Laukkanen, Makela, Keskinen and (even if he is aging) Ruotsalainen? The main difference between finnish and North- American players is, that our players tend to be better in the larger rink. The Canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in Europe.  And I think that there was more in our success than Ketterer and luck (though they helped). I think that the main reason was, that the team worked well together.	0

 You know, you're absolutely right.  I think we should round up all those players of European descent and ship 'em back to where they came from.  Let's see, with whom should we start?  I dunno, Lemieux?  Hmmm...sounds like he has *French* blood in him!!!  Hey!  France is part of Europe!  Send that Euro-blooded boy back!!!  Sheesh.   I don't think it would be hard to find some Native Americans (or Native Canadians, for that matter) who would dispute your claim to this great  continent of *ours.*  Ya see, if you believe the anthropologists, we're *all* immigrants of some sort.  If you really don't think that Mogilny, Bure, Selanne, et al have improved the NHL, then I'm not sure you understand the game.	0

    I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real- istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they still go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is  bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect  examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to attract, that these players are indeed superstars.    It ain't nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn't think about much  at all.  Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes that McDonalds makes good hamburgers?    Yes but apparently the Rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi- bilities has he?  He was hyped, initially, as a superstar, but outside of one Grey Cup game he has done very little to maintain/enhance that assess- ment of his talents.  Most Argo fans probably feel the team would be better off without him.   cordially, as always,  rm 	0
  Are there any further stories to report on the eve' of Norm's farewell  from the twin cities? In an earlier post, it was announced that Norm  Green was given until midnight of the last home-game of the North Stars to cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena.  Did this happen? Was Norm run-out-of-town?  Rumor has it that while he was attempting to remove the score board,  the score-board fell to the ice and flattened Mr. Greedy to a large piece of green paper. Arena management had to use the Zamboni (which  they confiscated from Norm's truck) to clean-up the useless remains. 	0
 Gee, you'd think Winnipeg would be tops on that list, what with 8 regulars being European.    Well, being a Jet fan, I sometimes wish that Bure would get knocked silly too.  (Nothing serious, just enough to keep him out of a game. :)    In most cases, the owners have very little to do with it.  They give their general managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best players so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.  Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.  Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some that play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm club, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on the secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.)) So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America.   I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the world.  I've grown up with Europeans playing on 'my' team, and some of those players were the among the best in the world.  From Hedberg, Nilsson, and Sjoberg, to Sel{nne, Zhamnov, and Olausson, and all those in between and to come, I wouldn't have it any other way.	0
 Actually, Messier was invited, but declined due to nagging injuries... Keenan and Messier have always gotten along...Keenan dumped Steve Yzerman from the last Canada Cup team, even though Yzerman had endured the training camp, when Messier who had missed essentially the entire camp recovering from injuries became available at the last moment.	0

The mission to revive hockey at UMass is now underway. At the  4 PM Saturday afternoon press conference held at the new Mullins Center Arena - former Boston College Asst. Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the 4 year, $85,000/year contract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen.   Mallen was the third viable pick for the position, right behind Jeff Jackson (Lake Superior) and second behind Shawn Walsh (UMaine). Previous offers for  the position were rumored to have been offered to the asst. coaches of Brown, RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians.  UMass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had undermined the team's position over a period of years. In late November of last year, the $52 million Mullins Sports Center was opened following its one year construction deadline.   The Minutemen are slated to play an independent Div II/Div III schedule this upcoming winter before officially entering Hockey East for the Winter 1994 season. Mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or potential team candidates for the Minutemen - it is expected that he will leverage off his inside contacts within New England, the Bay State and Europe to draw on competitive, top ice players for the University.  UMass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming Fall semester ;  expect to hear more from me as I hear more from my sources.  ....

 Chelios is by far the MVP on Chicago...   Manson, by his own admission, had a terrible year...the Oilers don't really have a team MVP...by default, it should go to Craig MacTavish.  Shjon Podein was the biggest surprise...Tikkanen the biggest disappointment.   Tinordi was back by mid-season last year...and when he plays he is the MVP.   King had a great year last year also.   How can Kovalev be a surprise?   Fence-sitting...look at Philly's record with Eric and without... there is no doubt.  Soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise.   Tocchet had a near 100 point season in Philly with Mike Bullard as his center...why shouldn't he be able to do that with Mario?   Really Joseph deserves the MVP nod. 	0
The Hawks won the Norris div, and sealed their fate.  It's bad luck to win the Norris.  The Hawks will sweep the Blues in their dreams but will lose in 6 in reality.

* The Keenan hiring is precipitated by the loss of an anticipated $5M in playoff revenue and fears of losing season ticket-holders (!), plus Paramount chief Stan Jaffe's chip against the Flyers over l'Affaire Lindros last autumn.  Add to this that Neilsen might return as an assistant coach [Gerald, what'd I say earlier today??], and Roger conferred with Jaffe on the hiring.  This hiring by Jaffe went over the head of MSG, Inc. (Par. subsidiary) head Bob Gutkowski and over the head and the protests of Pres./GM Neil Smith.  * MSG is making the announcement on Saturday to get back at the Islanders for making the playoffs (i.e., steal the press).  * Flyers owner Ed Snyder is livid and beside himself over this.  * Keenan will make up to $900,000/yr.  * Gary Bettman has appointed an independent consul to look at Gil Stein's admission into the Hall of Fame.  * New crease colours, rather than blue?  * The Oilers will charge to eat in the Press Room next year.  gld	0

   Well, it seems that the Habs have been much talked-about of late, so here's my $0.02.  These guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the damn net!!!  Watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay.  Damphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to the point, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....BUT WHERE'S THE SHOT??! Answer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands in front of the net a la` Neely, Shanahan, Tocchet, etc etc.  Too bad  Demers won't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often.  Dammit, even Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needs a power forward with some talent, IMO.  Then watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Say what you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see.  And Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net.  Last night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal came on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time, and he didn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.  The second goal came on a deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  Pathetic defence.  The third goal was EN.  No wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen. 	0

 I haven't seen enough Royals' games to judge his tactics, so you may have a point here.  But:   IMO, the Royals don't have a chance to win the pennant even if McRae suddenly began channeling for John McGraw.  OK, they have some decent pitchers.  But when your offense consists of bums like Gagne and Lind and McReynolds and McRae and an over-the-hill Brett, you're not going to finish .500 unless McGraw brings Christy Mathewson back with him.  I'd say it is hard to evaluate a manager when all of his hitters suck.	0

"   It's not a cliche, and (unlike your comments below) it's not a tautology. It needn't have been true.  If every pitcher in baseball were essentially the same in quality (i.e. if the variance of pitching ability were much smaller than the variance of batting ability), then scoring runs would be much more important than preventing them, simply because the *ability* to actively prevent runs would be much weaker.   If that's your point, you should have said so.  What you in fact said was ""Pitching and defense win championships"", and later ""Pitching is the essence of baseball"".  Neither of which says what you are now claiming was ""your  point"", and neither of which is true.   And you accuse Sherri of mouthing cliches!?   It's not clear to me at all that this is true.  In high-scoring games, the team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time.  In low- scoring games, the split is essentially 50/50 regardless of team ability.   I thought you said ""pitching and defense win championships"" and ""pitching is the essence of baseball"".   "	0

    No....Hal McRae is the worst manager in baseball.  I've never seen a guy who can waste talent like he can.  One of the best raw-talent staffs in the league, and he's still finding a way to lose.  I'll be surprised if he makes it through the next 2 weeks, unless drastic improvement is made.	0
 [...]   According to the Defensive Average stats posted by Sherri, Baerga had the highest percentage of DPs turned in the league, while Alomar had the worst. However, Alomar had a higher Defensive Average.  So who would be better?  Using Alomar's opportunities (469 groundballs, 73 possible double plays) Alomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 DPs. Baerga would have had (with same DA & DP%) 328 groundouts and 35 DPs.  Using Baerga's opportunites (545 groundballs, 99 possible double plays). Alomar would have had (with the same DA & DP%) 386 groundouts and 25 DPs. Baerga had 381 groundouts and 47 DPs.  Baerga looks better, though it's possible his DP% would be lower with a  different SS.  Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however?  Alomar has established a high level of defense, Baerga has not.  I would bet on Alomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall. --  Dale J.

 This leads me to believe that it's not really a rabbitball year, and that we've just had a rash of high-scoring games.  I bet this one day's worth of games pulled everything back to close to average.  Interesting, because the other day, all but three games had ten or more runs scored, and yesterday no game had more than nine.	0
  For your information, Lankford is injured (I think it is his shoulder or rib cage), so he could not use him as a pinch hitter.   I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does not have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively. Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:) I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.   As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.   I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make a perfect throw?   I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/ Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading in the right direction.   One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds, but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they lose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.

   Oh, lighten up.  What depresses me is that they might actually  finish last, which I believe hasn't happened since their second season in  1970.  Never mind that Gubizca is 0-2 with a 16.50 ERA, Gardner at 7.50, our main recent acquisitions (Lind, McReynolds, Jose) are averaging .210, David Cone is 0-2 (about how he was doing in KC before joining the Mets  several years ago), our hitting sucks, and our pitching has collapsed,  and we've won one game at home; they've won more games in their first ten games than last year, and Brian McRae is actually batting over the  Mendoza line!	0
" I have lived in the Boston area for 15 years now.  They have been talking about a new Boston Garden (hockey/basketball) since I've lived here.  One day the ""last hurdle"" has been overcome, and the next day there's a new hurdle.  Fans have been grumbling about Foxboro Stadium (or whatever it's called this year) for nearly as long, but there are only preliminary proposals for a new stadium.  Local politics prevents anything from being done in a timely fashion.  There will not be a new ballpark in my lifetime."	0
" how do you know this? did lasorda say, before the game, ""here's the lineup i'm using.  i'm batting strawman fourth because the primadonna insists on batting cleanup""?  if this is true (note that i don't think it is), lasorda should be fired for at least two reasons:           1) publicly humiliating his players;          2) knuckling under to his players wishes.  however, i think that the more likely explanation is that lasorda wanted strawberry to bat fourth, and that you hate strawberry."	0
"Finally, an objective source.  Alomar's a great player, but so is Baerga. Nice to see the objective source cited rather than ""my dad's bigger than your dad"" posts."	0
  Well, OBP is the most important offensive statistic, and by a big margin. 50 points of OBP is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging. That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year, but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find.  I personally don't care much for Alomar's defense.  I don't think he's nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP to save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release is slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming I can't overlook.  In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position.  If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar could be a hell of a CF.  In the long run, I think I'd rather have Jeff Kent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White.    	0
I haven't been following the previous HR's.  But there are two, that I saw live that would have to be up there (up where? there!).   1) Rick Monday's HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in 1981. It was hit off Steve Rogers, who is a RHP and primarily a starter. Why was he used as a reliever when the 'Spos had Reardon and BillLee warming up in the bullpen.  Considering Monday couldn't touch LHP, Lee would have been a safe bet.  He wasn't even doing any drugs at that time (or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into  Montreal.  The blast wasn't the important aspect.  It was the timing. Seventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the 9th.  The Expos almost came back though... 2) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980.  So close, yet, so far. and 3) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of years ago.  It went off the technical ring in the Big O.  It almost left the stadium!  That was hit HARD!!!     CorelMARK!  	0

 All they said on the radio that he developed stiffness in the shoulder after throwing a curveball that didn't loosen.  Because of the cold night in Denver they decided to remove him from the game rather than let him pitch.

"I've been a Giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained about the old ballyard place. Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long, and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique. Or so I thought.  I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was  a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but  everything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are CLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite.   The new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence are very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic  old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.  These things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real  businessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out. Just  like he used to tell his checkers, ""If the customers don't come back, I don't need as many checkers"". This isn't a knock on Bob Lurie - he was a competent businessman but he didn't deal much with the general public.  I'll give an example of how the level of service has changed. The onion  dispenser jammed as I was using it. An attendant came over, apoligized for the problem and proceeded to fix the machine. After he was done, he cleaned the machine and said he was glad to be able to help. In the old days, there was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say ""Go to the stand 100 feet away - they might be able to help"".  All in all, it was a fun day  "	0

   Sorry, but this is the biggest load of bunk I've seen in a while.  a) The Pirates have been trying to trade LaValliere for some time now. Nobody was even vaguely interested. b) Several other teams had made it known that they would grab Prince, who was out of options. c) LaValliere's release had nothing to do with him being through. He was released, because, in the event of an injury to Slaught, LaValliere is no longer capable (they believe) of being the everyday catcher.  Since Slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties, the offense should actually improve with this move.	0
"   Not if you've scored four runs, you don't!  Why strain even the best pitching staff?  Why not make it easier for them?    In the 2-1 game, the best pitching staff in the world can't compensate for a blown call, a bad hop, a gust of wind.  Winning close is the  wrong way to win; both keeping opposing runs down AND scoring a lot  yourself are insurance against the ""Shit happens"" aspect of baseball.  Not every great teamhas even *good* pitching.  The Big Red Machine of the 70's was league-average in pitching.  But somehow, Rose-Morgan-Bench- Perez-etc. managed to win 100 games more than once, peaking at 108."	0

" Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for argument's sake, define ""rushed"" as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I'm serious; I tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are any.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can look up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).    Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was ""rushed"", although there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job, and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being ""rushed""; Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have been less likely to give up on him.  Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  But does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts performing up to expectations?"	0

 But why would you want to use RBI?   RBI is an attempt to measure is some combination of clutch hitting and power hitting.  If you believe in clutch hitting, then look at how the guy hit with RISP.  If you want to see how good of a slugger he is, then look at his slugging average.    In terms of evaluating players, RBI totals are better than nothing.  But why use them when so many better stats are out there? 	0

  Interesting article, Craig.  It's amazing how hard it is to get baseball teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their customers.  No other business could ever get away with the 19th century  attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs.  I guess the owners look at baseball's high growth rate and ask why it's necessary to bring 20th century business practices into the game, but they don't realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they pay in terms of long-term popularity by not doing better by the game and its fans.	0

Tigers' manager Sparky Anderson gets his 2,000th career win as moments ago, the Tigers completed a two game sweep over the Oakland A's at Tiger Stadium by beating the A's 3-2. Here are the highlights:       R    H   E                  Oakland  2    9   0       Detroit            3    7   1  Chad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from 1st with an RBI double in the  bottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the Tigers the victory.  Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to tie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).  The A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo homer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the 7th for the other Tiger run.  John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting through the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas in the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was replaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and finally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while Witt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.  In the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said its one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It was a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously very happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.  Considering the circumstances, I think it might be appropriate to say:                  WOOF!      Go Tigers!	0

 After reading my local paper today, I found out that the Phillies started the 1964 season at 10-2.  I am not as old as 1964, but I've heard many talk about the serious choke job the Phillies did that season. They were ahead of the Cardinals by 15 games that season in mid-August.  They managed to lose a bunch from then on and the Cardinals took the division.  15!!! games ahead and lost it.... I hope this season is MUCH different.  	0
 As I have read this net the last few days, I am continually amazed at the  pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals.  Especially when it  comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Sox fan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you with short memories. short lives, or both.    To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism from those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported based on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a  team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.    Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of  detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what  happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly  not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all, remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that far, let alone beat Baltimore.  Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football and Basketball.  Because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what the outcome will be over the course of 162 games.	0

Hell, the Orioles' Opening Day game could easily be the largest in history if we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. But unfortunely the Yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots. Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89).   On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.  Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching staff looks pretty good. Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, and Fernando.  Baltimore is my pick for the victors in a very competitive AL East. __________________________________________________________________________ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Second to last day of the season - Gregg (The True Wild Thing) Olson uncorks a wild pitch allowing the Blue Jays to tie.

"Oops!  I came across this file from last year.  Thought you might enjoy some of these thoughts.  The predictions were made on the date indicated.  They are largely out of order.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  June 11, 1992 tedward@cs.cornell.edu (ME!)   You all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees all disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the expected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.  The Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised anybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the Angels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in June.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins dropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.  Okay, so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictive calculation, I thought this did pretty well. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  From CAVGEOE@YaleVM.YCC.Yale.Edu Tue Mar 31 16:36:34 1992  Hm.

Tsk Tsk.  Not nice to predict something like this.   You got that right!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  And my response...   Okay, so the Mets finished fifth.  But I got the Pirates and Expos right!   First half?  Dead on!  Second half?  Ummm....  I'm a Sox fan, go easy on me!

Grace *didn't* hit behind Dawson the entire season, but he also finished with only 79 RBIs.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Nope.

But a ballsy prediction, nonetheless.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  From ECAXRON@MARS.LERC.NASA.GOV Thu May 21 16:42:21 1992  The Orioles finished seven games out.  None of them won 20 (though Mussina might have had a chance, with better relief and more starts).   Except for the Brewers (who you probably forgot), you were right!

He wasn't bad last year, just too consistent to be an ace.  So far this year looks like more of the same.   I honestly can't say.  Did they get rid of him?  Their BB totals were down last year.

" Well, maybe it will be.  Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who ""hasn't  matured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year-old  who is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young, and  have looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim  Deshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies  hasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has  gone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven.  I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.   Well, Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year, but  was a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is  split (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry  Jorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3  years.

[Deletions]  Geez, Dal must have slipped something into Ted's drink sometime.  Comparing Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  Prince has never hit well in the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville  before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the  majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he  became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation  as an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned to hit.  His four years with more than 100 AB--  Born 31 July 1962 Year     AB      BA     SLG     OBA   1988    195    .282    .320    .328 1990    220    .277    .373    .321 1991    459    .264    .351    .317 1992    485    .249    .359    .290   No power, less-than-league-average walks, peak year when he turned 28,  now declining.  If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince, given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not a rosy picture.  BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation  coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.

"  Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't  know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick.    Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.    Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been  a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.    You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one,  the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should  HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.  Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.    Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?    Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a  good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early 80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.  Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.    Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a ""mediot""  candidate, pushed because of his ""winning attitude"" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his ""great defense"" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.  SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris' ""ability to win"" which is nothing more than Morris' ""ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs"".  At this point, Morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned  close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF ""consideration"".    Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about ""Yount and Smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time"".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's  just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre... (Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)  Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY  tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.   This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it  or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.  I won't consider ANYONE who started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [Note: these are all active players, I'm not counting recent retirees]  Baltimore:  Cal Ripken (should be a lock by now, even if Gehrig's record stands) Boston: Roger Clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), Dawson (?) Detroit: Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker (possibilities) Milwaukee: Robin Yount (discussed earlier) New York: Wade Boggs (possibly), Mattingly (long shot) Toronto: Paul Molitor and Jack Morris (possibilities)  Kansas City: George Brett (lock) Minnesota: Kirby (too early to tell), Winfield (lock) Oakland: Eckersley (lock), McGwire (too early), Rickey (lock), Welch (LONG shot) Texas: The Mighty Nolan [Too early to consider Canseco or Strange :-)]  Cubs: Sandberg (lock) St. Louis: Ozzie (lock), Lee Smith (probably) New York: Murray (almost a lock), Saberhagen (obviously, he's got to regain              past form) [And most certainly, NOT Vince Coleman, despite what he'll tell you :-)]  Los Angeles: Butler, Strawberry, and Hershiser are all long shots. San Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot) Colorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)   [Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's probably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include Barry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco, McGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before 1985)]   E-mail or post, I almost fear what I may have started here...

  Why?  Do you suppose he's immune to the ravages of time?  He's 37.   In a few years he'll be 40.  He doesn't get to as many grounders as he used to, and will get to fewer still as his legs go, as they do on every human so far.  Remember: Willie Mays was a defensive liability at he end of his career too.  Ditto Mickey Mantle.  Ditto just about everyone else who  played into their late 30's.	0
I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers, notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at the Stick.  After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was  very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).  It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.  The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.  I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.  For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year.	0

 Geez.  Everyone comes up with Clark, Williams, Thompson.  These guys were all up in 1987.  That's ancient history.  So in the last 6 years, noone, right?  Beck doesn't count.  I said 2 solid years.   Let's see what he does w/o the help of a pitchout every other pitch. As I remember, even Bob Brenly had a good throwout percentage under Roger Craig, who loved to sacrifice the count for runners being thrown out.  Of course, he suffered from 3 ball 1 strike homers a lot too. I am not a big fan of Manwaring. 	0
  The roar at Michigan and Trumbull should be loader than ever this year.  With Mike Illitch at the head and Ernie Harwell back at the booth, the tiger bats will bang this summer.  Already they have scored 20 runs in two games and with Fielder, Tettleton, and Deer I think they can win the division.  No pitching! Bull!  Gully, Moore, Wells, and Krueger make up a decent staff that will keep the team into many games.  Then there is Henneman to close it out.  Watch out Boston, Toronto, and Baltimore - the Motor City Kittys are back. 	0

" Yes.  But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our decisions on.  I might as well say ""We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet tall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.""   Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.  As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent season?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to use.   The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him down ""until he gets warmed up"".   Most players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do with Javy Lopez?   See above.     But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most players aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year either.   And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.   Not superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're being charitable.   Ummm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a big question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable bat... for a shortstop.    Wanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.   Just like Keith Mitchell did?   That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience, or some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization.   [Well-argued but inflammatory reply deleted.]  "	0

 Another word (offense) makes them my pick for last too. (Well, there's also my policy of never picking a Buck Rodgers' team for last)   The 1961 Angels were  1/2 game out of 7th. The Athletics and  expansion Senators finished tied for last.  The 1962 Colt 45's finshed 8th - ahead of the Cubs (the Mets were last). The 1969 Royals finshed 4th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last). The 1977 Mariners finished 6th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).  Apparently being an expansion team with a poor A's or Chicago  team around is a `good thing'   This may be an appropriate comparison. The 1929-31 Yankees finshed 2nd, 3rd and 2nd finshing  18, 16 and 13-1/2 games out of first.  In 1933,'34 and '35 they also finished second ( though they were only 7, 7 and 3 games out). Even great teams can lose - That's why they play the season. (on the other hand... I'm still picking the Braves to go all the way)	0
"Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off if an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame!  1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though Lopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still recovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe), and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.  I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez can hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was the Braves ""Defensive Catcher"" prospect, while Brian Deak was the Braves ""Offensive Catcher"" prospect.  Besides, Olson and Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard box, and don't walk enough to be useful.  But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went with the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.  2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around. After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher (California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work. Plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't tiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill at $450,000, but that's only what I recall).  3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players aren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster the longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change, but the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business standpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the first time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.  4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team. I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves, and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field, which, IMO, includes Lopez.  Of course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)  As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went like this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's) (the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)  Cox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a little smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding is better than it used to be.  Schuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion just won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count on him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the defense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on Billy Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs, we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to give us some pitching depth in 1995.  Cox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign. OK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having Berry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about Klesko?  Schuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil for Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money or Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell, but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First Jeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he gets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!  Cox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading deadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few extra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California... if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid. And if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees could be ""persuaded"" to act up.  There's always the 15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Schuerholz:  What about Caraballo?  Cox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts in Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks.  Schuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.  Cox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson would recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into running into him again?  Schuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get $3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one extra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little bit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed hitter.  You know how rare that is?  Cox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common, if you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in the World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!  Schuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez into the lineup.  Cox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff Reardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used to our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with them this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?  Schuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep will be hurt by May.  Cox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I can call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant! THE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey Stengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto, but have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally get my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!  Schuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those ""happy pills"" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why'd you ever hire that guy anyhow?  Cox:  Don't ask me; ask Ted.  ------------------------------------------------------- Eric Roush  fierkelab@ bchm.biochem.duke.edu ""I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort"" Grafitti, Paris, 1968  TANSTAAFL!

Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.  For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game,  With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform, a left handed hitter and play jordan and gilkey, both right handers.  Later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis Alicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter.  What the Hell is he thinking.  Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt, But torre said he liked Gilkey coming off the bench.  Gilkey hit over 300 last year, what does he have to do to start, The guy would be starting on most every team in the league.  Furthermore, in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate,  The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home,   I can't take this anymore  brian, a very distressed cardinal fan. -- 	0
"Did anyone notice the words ""NOT FOR BASEBALL"" printed on the picture of Joe Robbie Stadium in the Opening Day season preview section in USA Today? Any reason given for this?  Also, I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in the preview. On 8/22/89, Rickey Henderson became Nolan's 5000th strikeout. On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his 939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of publicity at Rickey's expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately. They are both great players, but IMO, Nolan has outclassed Rickey, both in playing and more importantly, in attitude. Just my thoughts."	0

      The Giants always hit Maddux well, but it was interesting that Maddux did not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night.  He threw 2 straight fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd, when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.       The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning about his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.         The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba has done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher from last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.  With Burba moving into the rotation, Mike Jackson is the only right-handed reliever aside from Rod Beck, he'll get a lot of actions.  I also hope that Dusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig, especially on Beck. I was concerned when Beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week.         So far so good! 	0
     Um, what?  Eddie Murray was a superb first baseman for a *long* time.  Winfield as produced consistently for almsot 20 years, and excellently on several occasions.    Dave Kingman's *best* year was like Darryl Strawberry's *typical* year with the Mets.    Darrell Evans, too, did a whole lot more than just hit homers, which  *is* all that Kong did.      Whom are you talking about?  Yes, Eddie Murray is marginal, but that's because he's 38 years old.  He wasn't marginal for a *long* time.    Not.    Smith has hung around for a long time AND fielded the position better  than anyone else ever has.  Yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago, in case you hadn't  noticed.  One of his two MVP awards was as a centerfielder.    Like whom?  There are many players in the Hall who aren't anywhere near as goos as the guys you're running down.   That's already the case, by some standards.  But the *bad* players in the  Hall are all from the 20's and 30's.  Recent picks have generally been excellent.   No, but who cares?  Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth? Not really.  But he obviously belongs there.  The Hall has generally had about the top 1% of major leaguers.  As  more players come through the game, more will be in that top 1%.    And, yes, it's pretty easy to argue that Smith,. Yount, Evans, Winfield, etc. are in the top 1%.  Dave Kingman on the other hand, was a liability throughout most of his career.  Of course, Garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of HOF press, so I don't know what you mean.    As for Ryan, is his W-L better than Morris'?  That's what a lot of voters tend to look at.  And Morris *was* awfully good for a decade, and doesn't lead MLB history in walks allowed, either.	0
  This list brings to mind possible the worst trade since Babe for  NONO NANNETTE, i.e., Milt Pappas for Frank Robinson, I think in  1965 ?. Robinson proceeded to win the triple crown in 1966 and  may have beaten out Yaz in '67 but was injured on a slide into   second when he collided with the mighty Al Weis (Chisox). 	0
" There is NO TEAM, repeat, NO TEAM, that is America's team.  This is a diverse country with 26 MLB teams (+2 up north) and there is no one team that is America's.  Who would the other teams belong to?  And how does it happen?  Well, teams receive this monicker through success (Cowboys), national exposure (Cubs), or both (Braves).

 Lou wanted Morris all along.  The idiot.  Giving the man $40 million to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded Uzi with the safety off.  The only question is how many shots he will get off before somebody is wise enough to take it away.   I don't see why people expect Boston to finish sixth.  The bottom four teams last year were essentially tied.  Boston, in seventh place, had 73 wins.  The Yankees and Indians, tied for fourth place, had 76 wins.  Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than the Indians or Tigers.  Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this year at 1B, DH, SS, LF, and RF.  They have healthier starting pitchers (so far, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why they shouldn't win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and the Tigers *still* have no pitching.  They will win some 20-3 blowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too.  *MAYBE* the Sox will play poorly, win 78 games, and finish fifth. But I think third or fourth place is more likely.	0
  It depends.  If you can get your old veterans cheap, and if they can perform at a higher level than your young talent can *now*, why not the talent  develop in the minors while giving the fans some familiar names to cheer. If the veterans are gone in a year or two -- that should be just about right.   Open question -- which was more important to the expansion clubs, the expansion draft or the regular draft.

" Not really, though I wouldn't personally say ""the most deserving candidate wins"".  Rarely does a player win ROY when called up in mid season, and there have been several duds in recent years.  But this is more a factor of mediot biases than anything else.  (I wonder.  If Amaral hits like he is capable of, will he receive ROTY votes?  He's only 31, he could have a long career ahead of him!  :-)   I think they are a second-division team.  They should finish ahead of the Royals, Mariners, and *possibly* Athletics.  But I don't think they'll be above .500.  (I think the East is stronger this year.)  Last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible.  This year their offense is better, but their pitching is still pretty bad. Even if Finley returns to form, he won't replace what they lost in Abbott.  Sanderson?  Farrell?  I don't believe it.  And while their BA may be good, and they have decent speed, their offense lacks punch.  They don't have any bona fide power hitters. (Salmon, Snow, Davis, and Curtis?  None with more than 20 HR potential.)  Cheers, -Valentine"	0
" I like Alomar.  But I'd like to differ with your opinion about ""a city which is likely to pour in the votes..."".  I attended many games last year during the balloting.  I know that a great number of the attendees DID NOT fill out their ballots, but left them, beer soaked and torn on the floor of the stands.  Toronto gets no more and no less votes than any other city for the All Star game.  Unfortunately, this is not a one time thing.  I've attended games during the last four seasons, and it has happened every time.  The apathetic attitude to All Star ballots really offends me."	0
I'm pretty sure that Sandberg has done this at least once.  (I know someone will correct me if I'm wrong.)    RBIs and Runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics.

Sure, occasionally the guy can pitch well for 5 or 6 innings, but then he starts to go insane.

  The tribe will be in town from April 16 to the 19th. There are ALWAYS tickets available!

      But good ones can collapse somewhat, then come back the next year. Burleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and an ERA around 4 in '25.  He pitched well for several more years.  Carlton won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.)      And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in 1985.  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at the start of the season.        If I recall, he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the 2nd half of last year.        Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds up w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189 innings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have his totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.        My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts. (Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4 scoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like a really good one.  Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine. Luckily, the Jays have a very good offense.)      I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year. He'll just be replaced by Stewart or Cox.	0

I have been following this thread on talk.religion, soc.religion.christian.bible-study and here with interest.  I am amazed at the different non-biblical argument those who oppose the Sabbath present.   One question comes to mind, especially since my last one was not answered from Scripture.  Maybe clh may wish to provide the first response.  There is a lot of talk about the Sabbath of the TC being ceremonial.  Answer this:  Since the TC commandments is one law with ten parts on what biblical basis have you decided that only the Sabbath portion is ceremonial? OR You say that the seventh-day is the Sabbath but not applicable to Gentile Christians.  Does that mean the Sabbath commandment has been annulled?  References please.  If God did not intend His requirements on the Jews to be applicable to Gentile Christians why did He make it plain that the Gentiles were now grafted into the commonwealth of Israel?  Darius	0
 Actually, an apostle is someone who is sent.  If you will, mailmen could be called apostles in that sense.  However, with Jesus, they were designated and were given power.  Remember that there were many thousands of people who witnessed what Jesus did.  That didn't make them apostles, though.	0
 the classic references in this area are Jacques Ellul for a liberal/evangelical perspective and Os Guiness for a straight evangelical view.  If you want to look at non-christian sources try Alvin Toffler as the perennial optimist.  His views while blatently non christian explore where technology may be going.   This is regardless of technology.  Be careful to separate the issues of related to speed and dispersion of technology (how far the letter went and how quickly it got there) and the message being passed in the technology (something that seems to be totally wrong.)   When lecturing in this area I challenge my (non-christan/atheistic) class about the impact technology has on life, quality of life and the rights that they consider important.  Depending on how you work out your faith will determine your response to the use of technology.  For example friends of mine are considering IVF due to a life threatening situation the wife is going through; when it is over they will have the baby. (God willing).  In this case the technology is available and my friends have to decide what to do.  In all cases though you must decide if the technology is against God's revealed word.  Regards  David	0
  Which means he has absolutely no idea about what the Assumption is.  However greatly we extoll Mary, it is quite obvious that she is in no way God or even part of God or equal to God.  The Assumption of our Blessed Mother, meant that because of her close identification with the redemptive work of Christ, she was Assumed (note that she did not ASCEND) body and soul into Heaven, and is thus one of the few, along with Elijah, Enoch, Moses (maybe????) who are already perfected in Heaven.  Obviously, the Virgin Mary is far superior in glorification to any of the previously mentioned personages.  Jung should stick to Psychology rather than getting into Theology.	0

"[insert deletion of unnecessary quote]   First of all, God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing people.  He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus to ""seek and save that which was lost"" (Luke 19:10)?  You asked for it.  2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished. Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in God's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity. 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the disciples ""will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord"". 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth being condemned. Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in the ""fiery lake of burning sulfur"". Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast ""will be tormented with burning sulfur"" and there being ""no rest day or night"" for them because of it. Psalm 9:17:  ""The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.""  I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.   Joe Fisher  [In the following I'm mostly playing ""devil's advocate"".  I'm not advocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that it's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often uses the term ""second death"".  The most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to understand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire, whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35 implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably they just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to  understand this passage in a non-literal way.)  2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.  Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever. Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the eternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as ""the second death"". This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil, and humans?  2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is ""everlasting destruction""? This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be understood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity.  2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction. Revelation 21:6-8: see comment above Revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there, it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that  there is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people are tormented forever.  Psalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue."	0
  Well said, Michael!  The Catholic traditon has a list of behaviours called the Spiritual  Works of Mercy:  admonish the sinner instruct the ignorant counsel the doubtful comfort the sorrowful bear wrongs patiently forgive all injury pray for the living and the dead (yes, I know there is some controversy                             on this and I don't want to argue about it.)  These are all things that have a direct application to usenet.  People  ask questions and express doubts.  Some are in need of comfort or  prayers.  Imagine what would happen to flame wars if we bore wrongs  patiently and forgave injuries.   I would add that it is probably more  appropriate to do any admonishing by private email than publicly.	0

" Yes, it's important to realize that all actions have consequences, and that ""rules"" were made for our own good.  But to suggest that a *disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is  taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease for lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed blindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare say all of us would be walking into walls.  Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for  sin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any other STD is a *punishment"" for sexual sin, what do we do with  diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle?  Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or  some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed  relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be, but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.  Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I  think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I (or something like that).

"I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God coming down to earth to live as one of us ""subject to sin and death"" (as one of the consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was that Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity, then Jesus ""fully human"" (Nicea) would not be ""subject to sin"", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning, because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish between ""human"" and ""fallen human"" makes Jesus less like one of us at the time we need him most.   First, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they  were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as extreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history) claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing (I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean, in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son ""uncreate"" -- surely even  Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's opponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require two seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because Mary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely, if you accept ""Nestorianism"" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined, a la Chalcedon.  Second, I am not sure that ""Nestorianism"" is not a better alternative than the orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think rather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate nature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine nature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed.  Comments on the above warmly appreciated.  Jason Albert  [There may be differences in what we mean by ""subject to sin"".  The original complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call Jesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that Jesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by not succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human.  I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I agree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was not Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of the correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he got the better of them.  However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to Chalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least ""rash and dogmatic"" (as the editor of ""The Christological Controversy"" refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As regular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I think are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from Cyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says ""To attribute also to [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother, either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the Greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and Apollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine Logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood.""  It's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have ""to some degree"" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it must be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos' participation in these things.  But there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human, or we don't have an incarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white terms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this area.  You say ""I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's human nature was in heaven.""  I don't think that's required by orthodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal."	0
    I have found that this isn't a very effective argument.  Most atheists are perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into  misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  They can always make an analogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan War, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations.   I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of  Christianity through argument.  We have to help foster faith and an understanding of God.  I could be wrong--are there any former atheists here who were led to Christianity by argument?	0
" some deleted   Dear Will,  I've never replied on this thing before so I hope it gets thru ok. I had a few thoughts!:  ""Faith on its own, if not accompanied by action is dead"" - James 2:17  Faith is both belief and action. If I say that I am a great swimmer but I never go swimming, am I really a swimmer? and will people believe that I am? Likewise if I say I'm a Christian but I never talk to God, am I really a Christian? My faith is demonstrated by my action. The fact that we talk to God proves we have faith. Satan believes in God but does not follow Him!  In a similar vein, I have recently been challenged by 1John2:3-6 v3 says ""We know that we have come to know Him if we obey His commands"" I find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that 'if we have come to know Him, then we'll obey His commands' cos He lives within us and we cannot help but obey what He says. I tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to God He will keep changing us into the likeness of Jesus and His fruit and works will be automatically produced in our lives.  Hope this helps."	0

 But what if the geologists are wrong and these people are warning of a non-existent danger?  Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both sides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.  The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from. Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right (and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.    Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.  (BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)  Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their mind.  As Melinda pointed out, there is no point in arguing along these lines because both approach from a different premise.  A more useful line of discussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths.  Personally, I don't mind what anyone believes as long as they allow me mine and we can all live peacefully.  	0
 That is not necessarily unorthodox.  When Christians call God 'Father',  we are using a metaphor.  The Bible in one place refers to God as being like a mother.  God is neither a father nor a mother in the literal sense; God has some of the attributes of both; the father metaphor is usually used because (for most people at most times) it is the less misleading of the two possibilities.	0
"  The next time you go to church, you can check the better creed, that is, have learned that on the first go around.  But what's a body without  a little bit a'soul?    At the risk of offending everybody, I will interject the 13th century point of view.  Christ descended immediately into the bosom of Abraham to set captives captive.  He preached to the saved for three days before drawing them with Him back to this earth.  I'm no expert on this part, but Matthew (27:52-53) says about the death of Jesus: ""tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.  And coming forth from the tombs after his resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to many.""  (NAB)  Regarding the hell of the damned, of which you speak, Christ did not see it (Ps 16:10, Acts 2:27), although it saw Him (cf. Is 45:2).    Concerning the abodes of the dead, I don't want to subject my brethren to further anguish, so I will direct you to contact me through e-mail if you are genuinely concerned.    Your new body might be something like Adam's before his fateful encounter with the Just One (Acts 7:52, CR trans. Vulgate): filled with infused knowledge, absent of concupiscence, and immortal.  It would probably be a little glorified, too.   I wouldn't recommend it.  It's really hot down at the center of the earth! You know, the normal geothermal gradient, and all that.

"    Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain  things before the world (i.e., publish them widely)?  These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any  pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.  Moreover, there are precedents in scripture where knowledge of sacred things is withheld:  1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed Peter, James, and John to ""tell the vision to no  man, until the Son of man be risen again from  the dead"" (Matt. 17:9).   If we were living at the time of Savior, there would be no (public) record of this event.  2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision  of ""paradise"" when he ""heard unspeakable words,  which it is not lawful for a man to utter"" (2 Cor. 12:4). This person heard something which Paul can not  write to the Corinthians (and us).  3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of Mormon where words uttered by ""babes"" were  ""forbidden that there should not any man write them (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows for those of you without access to the BOM).  3 Nephi 26:16 Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the  multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even  babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden that there should not any man write them.  Some LDS scholars speculate that these words which could not be written are the sacred portions from temple we are to withhold from  the world (but it could be something else).   There is much we can discuss about the temple  ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptisms and other vicarious ordinances for the dead. We can discuss certain concepts regarding the endowment (""the ritual""). However, there are certain elements I can not discuss with anyone (including other saints) outside of the temple. As a portion of the endowment, we receive the tokens and signs that will permit us access to Heaven.  I must keep this knowledge sacred  and respect the conditions under which it is revealed to me."	0
 I agree with what Darren has to say here, but would like to add a  personal observation.  What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)    comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu	0

Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims. : Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians : who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing : God's work?  Perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very act of killing.  Does it reflect the attitude of God, who sends rain to both the just and the unjust?  If not, then Christians should be uncomfortable with it.  Jesus gave his followers the law of love to follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known.  Doctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so I don't see why Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors converted from Christianity to Islam.  It seems to me that as a Christian you _should_ be troubled by the ethnic cleansing. -- "	0

"(MODERATOR: THIS IS A REPLACEMENT FOR AN EARLIER, MORE CLUMSILY WORDED SUBMISSION ON THE SAME TOPIC WHICH I SUBMITTED A FEW MINUTES AGO.)  I think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning.  Regardless of how the word 'Easter' *originated*, the fact is that it does not *now* mean anything to Christians other than 'the feast day of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ'.   The meaning of a word is _only_ what people understand it to mean.  And the same goes for other cultural practices.  The festival of Easter may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival, but *today* there are, as far as I know, no Christians who *intend* to honor any kind of ""pagan goddess"" by celebrating Easter.  It is nonsense to say ""this word (or this practice) 'really' means so- and-so even though nobody realizes it.""  Words and practices don't mean things, people do.

"He doesn't contradict himself.  The church is to last for all time. However, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  This is evident in many letters.  For instance, Paul talks about the ""super-apostles"" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentions how people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4). Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them (Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.  Verse 14:  ""And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.""  Even today, there are false teachings.  I can name two which I am well familiar with:  the non-need of baptism and the ""praying of Jesus into your life for salvation"".  Both are taught.  Both are DEAD wrong.  They have been taken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and just plain made up.  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  He then commands baptism in Matthew 28:18-20.  The church Jesus founded, though, is alive and well.

"{I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described.  This is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}  The standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents  is probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, ""Hermeneutrik und  Kritik,"" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of _Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen: Beck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The  Prophetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989). (If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley describes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the form of ""rules for forgers.""  It makes interesting reading.  I confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extract thereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and as far as I know there is no English translation available.  However, I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that  any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one  would expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not  be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to  determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and  culture or is a later forgery.  Actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:  1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example the Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found with them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects.  2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several generations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still  be tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself.  It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the document and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heard of a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king in what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the holograph).  They could check the language, content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a Palestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually wrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but (barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for  comparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was.  As I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.   Specifically we might ask:  1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict itself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to  maintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The  longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency. For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.  2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time? Again a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be able to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous  and trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.  3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech etc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that  seem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?   If so do they fit in with the culture?  Of course there are complications if the document has been translated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.  These tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work  with) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the  historian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to  ask are, ""Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we  know about the culture of claimed origin?""  If there are things  which don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really  significant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture."	0
  While I agree with most of Jon says (I deleted those parts, of course), I  have serious reservations about this advice.  Maintaining a `just  friends' level of relationship is much easier said than done.  People  usually end up getting hurt.  This is especially likely to happen when  they start off with feelings of attraction.    When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.   I've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldn't  date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to  believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each  other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to  their original state.    This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home  and fellowship.  I don't think it would work exactly this way for most  people.  However, it's important not to underestimate the power of  feelings of attraction.  	0

" The answer to both questions is yes.  All Scripture is true, being inspired by God.  The evidence for this claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.  Similarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a  contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always true.  Obviously, if a ""truth"" is not always ""true"" then we have a contradiction in terms.    Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a statement is terribly self-contradictory.  Let me put it to you this way.  If there are no absolutes, shouldn't we conclude that the statement, ""There are no absolutes"" is not absolutely true?  Obviously, we have a contradiction here.  This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.   So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true.  This does not negate the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  Moreover, evangelical Christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain truths.  Man is sinful, man needs salvation, and Jesus is the propitiation for mankind's sins, to name a few.  Any group that does not profess to believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.  "	0

My family has never been particularly religious - singing Christmas carols is about the limit for them. Thus I've never really believed in God and heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either - I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.         Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof - just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.          Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me - agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian??          Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??          I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and 'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God.          Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite believe in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not believing doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.          Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came into my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

 Here again, the problem with most of the individuals posting here, you take the biblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in the modern sense.  I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work  _Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ Cambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul here has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared, no ascension either.  Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts until well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly, I think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts before this which mention the tomb).         You are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable. See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_.	0
"   Always existing and being the source of the existence of all other beings is not problematic.  But, as you put, Being the source of ""all"" existence, including one's own, would mean that God came from nothing, a concept alien to Christianity and Theism.  It is better to understand the classical concepts of Necessary and Contingent existence.  God exists necessarily, always.  God created contingent beings.  This is a coherent solution to existence, so long as the concept of God is coherent.    Not a very good answer.  If reason cannot by any means understand something then it is likely that ""it"" is a null concept, something not in reality."	0

"for SRC  In most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is known as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word which comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning ""Passover."" In English, German, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER, or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the origin of this term.  One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE RATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived 673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that there had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name, and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance (surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should have a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does not make it more so.  Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the Christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots. It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply ""Spring Festival.""  However, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J Knoblech, in ""Die Sprach,"" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5 (Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:  Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast of the Resurrection was known as ""hebdomada alba"" (white week), since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was referred to simply as ""albae."" Translaters rendering this into German mistook it for the plural of ""alba,"" meaning ""dawn."" They accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for ""dawn."" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.   Yours,  James Kiefer "	0
" I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style ""values-free"" methods, that teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make ""choices"", actually _increase_ pregnancy rates. I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in ""contraceptive technology"" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach ""safe drug use"" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in ""how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs"" would increase drug use?  Why isn't ""drug abstinence education"" barred from schools because it teaches ""religion""?  Aren't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?

"    If the Papacy is infallible, and this is a matter of faith, then the     Pope cannot ""be wrong!""  If, on the other hand, this is not a matter     of faith, but a matter of Church law, then we should still obey as the    Pope is the legal head of the church.     In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice    but to obey.  This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying is more or less heresy.  You might call it ""infallibilism"".  It's the idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does. This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.  The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can make mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.  A couple historical examples come to mind.  Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the English Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though maybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even when they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there. This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop Grosseteste was quite right in what he did!  Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages. He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific Vision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around to defining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic doctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church. He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In the end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he recanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the Church.  If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such subjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall into heresy or schism."	0

I've heard it said that the accounts we have of Christs life and ministry in the Gospels were actually written many years after the event. (About 40 years or so). Is this correct?? If so, why the big time delay?? I know all scripture is inspired of God, so the time of writing is I suppose un-important, but I still can't help be curious!  --------------------------------------------------- Ivan Thomas Barr   Contact me at u9126619@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk  [The Gospels aren't dated, so we can only guess.  Luke's prolog is about the only thing we have from the author describing his process. The prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do some investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that say a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are debates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don't have the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them seriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and was written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die. One tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words may have been made earlier than the current Gospels.    In the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal transmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred to hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe even from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather than from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a period when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do think there was some written material earlier, which was probably used as sources for the existing Gospels.  Establishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to confess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods used.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64 AD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the Century.  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the other.	0
" John,   While I will not take the time to rebut you point by point, I will suggest three current works which I think will be helpful in your quest to answer this question.  John Dominic Crossan (Professor of Religion at De Paul Univ)- _The Cross That Spoke_ Harper and Row Pub. 1988, Also his latest work  _The Historical Jesus - The Life of A Mediterranean Jewish Peasant_ Harper and Row Pub. 1991,  Also two works of Burton Mack (Professor of New Testament at the Claremont Graduate School) _A Myth of Innocence_ Fortress Press 1988, And his latest book _The Lost Gospel: The Book of Q and Christian Origins_ Harper and Row, 1992.  You might start with Mack's book on Q and then  examine the others afterward.  However I think that once you do that you will see that your ""evidence"" is not as sturdy as you'd like.  Most of the tired arguements you stated, assume eyewitness accounts, such is not the case. But Anyway look at Mack and Crossan and then get back to us."	0

"Quoth the Moderator:   In a short poem (""God in His mercy made / the fixed pains of Hell""), C. S. Lewis expresses an idea that I'm sure was current among others, but I haven't be able to find its source:  that even Hell is an expression of mercy, because God limits the amount of separation from Him, and hence the amount of agony, that one can achieve.

A few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on earth:  One piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact that no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was buried. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever claimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why? Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.  Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of Mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned in the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.  The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to Christ.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we are to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave.  One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary did not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe. The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make sense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the cross, would want to share in his death.	0

"Hi there netters, I have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on: Is there such a thing as a 'justifible' war?   What I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: ""All war   is wrong"", or ""Some war is justifiable"".   To get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the   question. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New   Zealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of   it, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).   Through this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved   in the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation   hardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. My favourite   computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both   past and present.   I became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all   military activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition   to God's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies.  During the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to   the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation   technology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16   strike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy   simulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam's   bio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his   Mig's in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful   game. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.   One only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact   of war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a   pilot is simply a 'target'. Dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. These   euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose   support are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to   look at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.  Now we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and   the prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in   the former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of   Sarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,   has caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war.  I will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say   - Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut   reactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality   history brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for   my reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I   am working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.  1. The Second World War  - Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.  - Massive civilian casualties on both sides    - Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki  - Probably justifiable.  2. Korean war  - Political expansionism by North Korea, basically    communism vs. capitalism.  - Probably not justifiable.  3. Vietnam  - As above, worsened by US involvement.  4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.  - Genocide by Khmer Rouge.  - Probably justifiable.  5. Iraq (Desert Storm)  - Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply  - Other factors such as genocide.  - Not sure, but probably justifiable  6. A future involvement in Bosnia  - Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing'  - Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.  - Probably justifiable  7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,   somewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya   or Israel.  - My feelings in this are simple  - Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent  - I love the New Zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear    armed or powered warships from NZ port.  - Never justifiable.  These are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I   would appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. I   *don't* want a - Naaahh, yer wrong - I think answers 8-).

"The ONLY unity I've found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples.  I came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything into practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I've found that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they are just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in January when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this retreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even the people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple the previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only one area in which disciples stand out from ""Christians"".  Also, another part of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I've also been a part of some ""Christian"" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of conviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be unified, they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting along together.  Creeds?  What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly better?   According to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going to be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion and belief.  However, Scripture states:      In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).  How will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but before that, there are these qualities:    devotion to the apostles teaching    fellowship    communion    filling with awe for God    all having everything in common.    glad and sincere hearts    praising God    enjoying the favor of the people All these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, ""a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit"" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts 7:54-60).     One can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I have yet to find that, but the closest one I've found is the Boston Church of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I've seen which is totally sold out to God.  As for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may never occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the ""true one"", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they will not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I've heard numerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they've ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement. I know I haven't.  I must warn that this sounds cliquey to me.  A clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is something ""correct"" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of the churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of people who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational heads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being ""opened up"" so that they would have to step right back in. Their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he would've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division within.  There's enough division without. "	0
"According to mdbs@ms.uky.edu, muslims tithe 1/6 of their income.  Perhaps there are some offshoots of Islam that impose this on their followers.  But the standard tithe is 1/40 of one's net worth, once a year.  The same writer also objects to the Bible for teaching that   > ""woman was created after man, to be his helper"" etc.  This is presumably a reference to Genesis 2. Suppose that that chapter had been written with the sexes reversed. We have God creating woman, and then saying, ""It is not good that woman should be alone. I will make a help meet for her."" Feminists would be outraged. The clear implication would be that God had started at the bottom and worked up, making first the plants, then the fish and birds, then the beasts, then woman, and finally His masterpiece, the Male Chauvinist Pig. The statement that woman is not capable of functioning by herself, that she needs a man to open doors for her, would have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult. The fact that the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was given only briefly and in general, while the creation of the Man was given in six times the number of words, would have been cited as evidence of the author's estimate of the relative importance of the sexes. The verdict would have been unequivocal. ""No self-respecting woman can accept this book as a moral guide, or as anything but sexist trash!"" I suggest that Moses, fearing this reaction, altered his original draft and described the creation with Adam first and then Eve, so as to appease Miriam and other radical feminists of the day. For some reason, however, it did not work."	0
" Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history.  The Greek, for example, could say, ""better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead."" (Iliad, I think).  The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their sins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile humanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom Satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.   It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.  It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world.  It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people's ideas of life after death.   Mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at ""the turning point of time"" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new vision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well.  (At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my views on this subject).   The way you refer to it as ""doctrine"" puts a modern intellectual coloring on it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received.  I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed on, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In any case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid, but by contemplating the principles themselves.  On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim.   Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a single earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out.

 That would be neat, but nowhere in the Bible does it say that one who has the gift of tounges can do this.  If the gift of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone, no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the gift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to have been written.     That's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million Christians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those who do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian church also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.   I would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges  do so more often in private prayer than in public.  Link Hudson	0
Jesus isn't God ? When Jesus returns some people may miss Him ?  What version of the Bible do you read Mike ?  Jesus is God incarnate (in flesh) . Jesus said, 'I and the Father are one.'  Jesus was taken up to heaven after His 40 day post-resurrection stint and the angels who were there assured the apostles that Jesus would return the same way and that everyone will see the coming. That's why Jesus warned that many would come claiming to be Him but that we would know when Jesus actually returns.   These are two very large parts of my faith and you definitely hit a nerve :-)	0

 Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then.  To me, an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture, situations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agree with this definition?  I think you do:   A simple example:  In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can't provide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition,  this is truth and therefore absolute.    Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all  scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and  coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.   Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare  heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew  up in.)  Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) Can you reconcile this?   I don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are very few, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.    But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can you determine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree how to interpret the Scripture?    It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based  on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your own background, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the  Bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that  you in fact interpret?	0
" excellent question timothy. i hpoe the answers you get will be satisfactory   as we can not understand the mind of god. but to attempt to answer you   clearly. GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he   intends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus   Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to   serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god,   the bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world/have   already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche.   God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however   there is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not   tolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to   live with him on the wrong in your life.    Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The   Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's   penalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed   punishment for robbery is time in jail. God then cannot ask for anything but   punishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John   3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that   through him it might be saved."" when i realize that i have sinned, and i do   with painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin   against me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews   they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and   dis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the   fater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all.   for those who don't have that right, in the view of the bible they stand   olone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you.   i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to   Hell? that step is much more rewarding.  stan toney stoney@oyster.smcm.edu my opinions are my own, you may borrow them"	0
  Much of the OT prophecies have a double application: to the Jewish captivity, and to the end of time.  But if Rev. is dated at AD96 its prophecies could not apply to the AD70 destructioin of Jerusalem.	0
"Subject: Re: Seeking Christian opinion, all sorts. From: Rob Steele, rsteele@adam.ll.mit.edu Date: 5 May 93 06:52:54 GMT   One day a few years ago Franky Schaeffer walked into a Greek Orthodox Church.  He is now an Orthodox Christian.  So is his mother and if his father, Fransis Schaeffer, had not passed away he too would have come into the church.   Franky, like many Americans who have recently found the Orthodox church, described the experience as finally coming home after a long jouney through a desert.  You should also read the book ""Becoming Orthodox"" by Peter Gillquist.  It describes the long journey of some 2000 weary Evangelical Protestants to the Orthodox church.   Come taste and see how good the Lord is."	0

"note: i am not the original poster, i am just answering because i think this is important.  [evil result of human sinfulness, rather than the will of God]  whoo.  i'm going to have to be very careful with my language here.  i think God is voluntarily giving up his omniscience in this world so that we can decide on our own where we go -- free will.  in this sense God allows evil to occur, and in this sense can be ""held responsible"" as my chaplain says.  however, his will is, of course, that all be saved.  he's not going to save us ""by himself"" -- we have to take a step in his direction before he will save us.  read that last sentence carefully -- i'm not saying we save ourselves.  i'm saying we have to ACCEPT our salvation.  i do not believe in predestination -- it would appear from what you say further down that you do.    [stuff deleted]  ok -- i have trouble with that, but i guess that's one of those things that can't be resolved by argument.  i accept your interpretation.  [more deleted]         ^^^^^^^^^ this is what indicates to me that you may believe in predestination. am i correct?  i do not believe in predestination -- i believe we all choose whether or not we will accept God's gift of salvation to us. again, fundamental difference which can't really be resolved.  [yet more deleted]  yes, it is up to God to judge.  but he will only mete out that punishment at the last judgement.  as for now, evil can be done by human beings that is NOT God's will -- and the best we can do is see taht some good comes out of it somehow.  the thing that most worries me about the ""it is the will of God"" argument is that this will convince people that we should not STOP the rape and killing when i think that it is most christ-like to do just that.  if jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman (perhaps this is not a good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we not stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more innocent?

"I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged couple become ""married"" in God's eyes?  Some say that if the two have publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.  Suppose they are unable to get before the altar right at the current time because of purely logistical reasons beyond their control.  What do you think about this?

"Hello, I'm back..  I would first like to thank each and every person who sent me a response (be it a positive or negative one). I read EVERY letter and thought about  each one!!   I got all sorts of responses, from ""marry her"" to ""have nothing ever to  do with her again""  Through reading the Bible and through a lot of prayer, here is what I have decided to do.  I sent her a letter today. First, i told her that if she was really serious about moving away from home to another state that ""I would do anything to  get you here in NC."" I told her that I tried to find out if there were  any new stores planning to be built---but they wouldn't tell me.  About her marraige comment (I'm not gonna call it a proposal, cause I still don't know if it was a total joke or not) I more or less said that ""Marry me?? Well, get transferred to NC first and then we'll talk :) :)""  Hopefully, what i said could be interpreted either way.  Needless to say, there has been a lot of praying over this...I  have done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible. If she was dead serious about getting married---I wouldn't do it yet simply b/c she is not (as far as I know to this point) a Christian. It just wouldn't work w/o God in the marraige as well. I figure that if God wanrs this to go through--he's kept us in touch for 10  years now---he can handle one more. If God wants it to happen, it will happen!  She will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so I'll get to  see her...and I'll get a letter from her befoe then so I know more of what to look forward to.  I guess all I can do now is wait and pray. I have decided not to tell my folks until I'm totally sure what is going on.  I do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situation in your prayers..  Finally, I would like to thank EVERYONE who wrote in...  If you have anything else for me...I will be at this email address for one week. Please tell me anyhting you want...I'm curious how folks think about what i did.   Thanx"	0
"All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really sola scriptura.  Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so.  Andy Byler  [You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based on Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus' teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.  Accepting the principle of ""sola scriptura"" does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite clear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is on where the Bible would have us place the line.  By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide."	0

"Regarding the moral question Jen (jenk@microsoft.com) asked: ""Is it okay to create a child if you aren't able to be a good parent?"", I am reminded of a ""speech"" by one of the characters (I can't remember which) in the movie ""Parenthood"". [I am WAY to liberal with my quotation marks tonight...]  In this so-called (by me) speech, the character is expressing what  a lousy father he had and he made an interesting point.

 Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm afraid your friendship is in danger.   Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend, you  are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life?  Why  do you call into question his faith?  Your friend has changed, he has  found something that fills a need in his life.  You need to decide if  you are still his friend, whether you can accommodate his new life.   It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in  the Bible, yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief  that it is superstition.  Perhaps if he knew you at least took him  seriously, that you at least took an interest in the light he has found,  that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of  his life, you could together decide to become fundamentalists, respect  each others differences and remain friends, or part ways.  Maybe even if  you stuck it out with him, you could help him to un-convert.  Of course,  if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions  and begin to resent you.  I happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists, because I know that the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing. I don't happen to share the beliefs of fundamentalists, but I am not offended by their prosyletizing.  I had a few good conversations with some Witnesses who came to my door.  I didn't switch my beliefs, but for those at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere, the Witnesses provide a wonderful service.  You may have been conditioned to believe that religion is unimportant and witnessing is obnoxious, but why?  Are you afraid you might be converted and become one of them, that you will be swept up in fundamentalism, that you will become a weirdo. Friendship's a two-way street.  You must respect your friend, ALL of him, including his beliefs, if you want the friendship to continue.	0
" [ -and many others mailed me.  Here is a reply to one of the letters.  Seems to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell!]    Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course, in your termonology, God could not ""cease to exist.""  However, that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see that it signifies ""separation.""  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.    I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived.  She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my ""girlfriend"" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go there.      When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh.  You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.     This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.  Jesus most certainly felt the ""pinpricks"" of life.  As the Scripture say:  Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.  The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  ""The Consciousness of Christ.""  I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study, including clh.    It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do.  He ""grew in knowledge.""  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was ""led of the Spirit"" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise.  That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was living sequential history as you or I.    Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not.   I was once a member of that club.  THe ""free thinker"" is a glorious ideal.  By contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right.  But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his ""rational doubt"" when in fact he was led to it by his ""faith"".  He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a ""free thinker"" to criticize the Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.  Pascal pointed out that ""sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.  Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.""  The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term ""a""-theist.  Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember.  However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.  That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out ""Look, your fly is undone!""  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity.  The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral.  In other words, another myth.    Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence.   Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first ""Highlander"" movie.  But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of God.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you are to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct understanding of Himself."	0
"  There is a certain truth to this statement. Only I would use the word ""medicine"" instead of drug.  With regard to the condition of the human soul, Christianity is first and foremost a healing medicine.  It also strengthens and enables one, as healing takes hold, to grow in new strength and health to live and be and to do that for which God created  us.   Christ's medicine, rightly allowed to work, brings one nearer to reality and offers the clarity of understanding and the strength of spirit with which to meet it in a healthy human way.

" Dear Defiant (or Unfaithful or Pixie):  I will take up the challenge to reply, as I am a theist.  The foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existence of God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reason is indisputable (cf. my short treatise, ""Traditional Proofs for the  Existence of God,"" and Summa Theologica).  Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason, I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?  Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter, the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order to the universe (logos).  I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is contrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And, since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because a human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source of all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship. Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.  Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim is true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.  You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United States Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned, and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For example, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he could have denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true.   Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.  QED   --  boundary"	0
  One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin  of physically abusing one's wife.  The husband is usually physically  stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.   He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an  example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.  This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what  is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals  His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some  degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding  of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the  husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.   One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband  and to the husband through the wife. 	0

"  There are a lot of people running around saying ""God told me this"" and  ""God told me that"" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and others heard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He said someone told him, ""The Lord gave me a song.""  He said that it was the worst song he had ever heard.  ""I know why he gave you that song,"" Murillo said, ""He didn't want it anymore.""  But God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the idea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit in the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first to put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one we have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.    Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures. For example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an ""M"" who prophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy he gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies because the king complained before he heard the prophecy, ""He never prophesies anything good about me.""  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his  lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples. Barnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an  apostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of Agabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet before he gave them.    So prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it  Scripture.     I don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with  prophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also  similar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies in a seemingly prophetic way, for example, ""And his bishoprick let another take"" concerning Judas office.  A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about what will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural prophecy can be used in later prophecy.    Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge, but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom can overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.   Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often considered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a  bit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to label a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the  Spirit, and use them according to His leading."	0
Hi Xian Netters,  God bless you  CONTENTS 1. intro 2. love your neighbor 3. reaction to posts    a. purpose    b. eternal life  I've been reading this news group religiously =) for about a month.  Sometimes It really gives me what I need, spiritually.  At other times I get a little IRATE.    There are all kinds of people in every group and I take offense at intolerance.  It's awfully hard to tolerate such people. =) ( OOPS! I've gone over my smiley quota already and it's only the second paragraph =(.  IMHO they should follow the commandment to love thy neighbor and leave the judging up to GOD.    SPECIFICALLY: one's sexual orientation is part of one's self love the sinner hate the sin DOES NOT APPLY  Pay attention fundaligionists.  Love your neighbor wether you like it or not.  I'd be happy to get flamed endlessly and loose scripture quotation contests galore to defend this point.  I beleive this is correct.   BTW Love the sinner hate the sin is a slippery slope, with hatred at the bottom.    INCREDIBLY CHOPPED UP POST I won't even try to tell you where the deletions came out    I find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves.  Little in the cosmic sense.  Even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone, the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind, eventually to be turned into dust. Mankind itself will one day perish.  Without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical, without God, it is all pointless in the end.  Most people are able to live with that, and for them little purposes (success, money, power, effecting change, helping others) suffice.  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are at least able to put it out of their minds.  To me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world is a school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  That gives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressure off.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if you're really just here to learn.  It's more important to progress, grow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love, especially when it's dificult to do so.  Honest effort is rewarded by God, he knows our limitations.    Interesting theological question.  I have a feeling that most common perception of eternal life is WAY off base.  If I were to be imprisoned in the limited ego/mind I am in now I doubt I would choose imortality.  It would get awfully boring.    TWO SERIOUS QUESTIONS/INVITATIONS TO DISCUSSION 1.

"Biblical basis for the Immaculate Conception:  1) ""I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crush your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel.""     -Genesis 3.15  2) ""He who commits sin is of the devil ...""     -1 John 3.8  3) ""Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with thee ...""     -Luke 1.28     From the above, we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.    First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is the first promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles of Satan. ""[Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth because there is no truth in him."" John 8.44.  Now the proto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and ""the woman"", and enmity between Satan and ""her seed.""  Now the woman is both Eve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve.  ""Her seed"" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the same way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as we do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that Mary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmity with the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her sinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, as would God's veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the serpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.     Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the Archangle Gabriel ""full of grace.""  As I pointed out above this is from the Greek word ""Kecharitomene"" which means not just full of grace, but a plenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by the footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, ""Hail you who have been and reamin filled with grace.""  But that is a little to long to say, so it is reduced to full of grace.  And as it says, ""you who have been"" Mary had always been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which was also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.     It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done what the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if God could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his Mother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the Fathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo , St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of Christian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on the matter in ""Ineffibilus Deus."""	0

" An interesting interpretation of Revelation 17 and 18 has been given by   evangelist David Wilkerson.  I am not saying that I totally agree with his   interpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He   interprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good   old U. S. of A.  That's right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.    The Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the   WHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese   success of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the   world.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn't the whole world mourn?  The bible   also talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am   paraphrasing, of course).  Babylon's sin affected, or should I say, infected,   the whole world.  It doesn't take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a   state of moral decay.  Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the ""do   it if it feels good"" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what   Mr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls   Babylon ""Babylon the Great"" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on   earth.  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I   don't think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the   most powerful nation on earth.  Again, this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own, but I do find it worthy   of consideration."	0
"The story I related is one of the seven apparitions approved by our Church as worthy of belief.  It happened in La Salle, France.  The moral lesson of the story is:  The Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has  been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives worthy of being done in Heaven.  Mary weeps for The Lamb and for the rest of her offsprings.  This will continue while we  disobey God or sin against Him.  Mary, as a messenger,  has been given the task to make us be 'aware' of the evil serpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedience to God, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings.    The children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is  brought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins,  to obey God's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence  of The Lamb.  As she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the Son of God in her womb, Mary has been preparing us, the Church, the Body of Christ, for His second coming (making sure we are  protected from the dragon).  Also, she has been preparing the new  Eden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.  The new Eden will be the sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His next coming.      I relate the story again:     I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions       in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these           two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot          the exact place).  She was  weeping and telling the      children that she is afraid she's ""going to lose her     Son's arm"".  She is mourning too for these               townfolks because it was their fault that there          would be drought in their harvest; not much good         food again this year as it was last year.                                                                         Mary tells the children:                             *    Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole    * *    week even on Sundays when they should be in church  * *    honoring God.  These townfolks swears and           * *    uses her Son's name in bad words.  That is          *     why her Son's arm is so heavy in pain.                   Then she asked them if they pray.  The children          said ""hardly"".  She asked them to pray every             morning and night.  When the children went back          from work they had to tell somebody about this.          When the news was spred and after thorough           *    investigation of the incident, the townfolks        * *    were converted and faith and obedience to God       * *    were restored in their community.                   *   Once again, the Lamb succeeds."	0
"   Some variant is quite popular.  This, and other arguments, are discussed in John Leslie Mackie's ""The Miracle of Theism: arguments for and against the existence of God"".  Although Mackie ultimately sides with ""against"", his arguments are, I think, quite fair to both sides.  Brief discussions can be found in the alt.atheism FAQs."	0
"     More correctly: when people die, they cease to exist.     The idea I've gotten is that to christians, Hell is -- like Heaven --  afterlife; i.e, you don't cease to exist, but are subjected to eternal   torture (well, that's the orthodox idea anyway; ""eternal death"" if you  prefer that). Atheists don't believe in any sort of afterlife.    I think it's safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical. Certainly  not the equivalent of ceasing to exist. Some christian concepts are indeed  metaphors, but your idea of Hell is a 20th century interpretation. It is, of  course, nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview   of modern age, but I fear the church will not accept it. Understandably, per-  haps, because if you accept that Hell is a metaphor, then you're one step  closer to turning God into a metaphor as well."	0
" No the members of the first group are not necessarily arrogant.  But when I ask them if they are absolutely certain that the volcano will erupt, I expect them to say so ""No, but I've chosen to believe some knowledgable people who have determined that the volcano will erupt,"" rather than, ""Yes, I am absolutely certain.""  When it comes to religious discussions, arrogance or at best naivete is reflected in the latter type of statement.   "	0
"I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned,      and the trumpet had blown. I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment      before the white throne. Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate. They cried for the rock and the mountains. They prayed, but their prayers were too late. The soul that had put off salvation,  ""Not tonight I'll get saved by and by.  No time now to think of ....... religion,""  Alas, he had found time to die. And I saw a Great White Throne.  Now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said,  ""Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.""  Today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that there's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.    As Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a place called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going to ""outer darkness."".    Jesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared it for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere, that God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the elect are the ""whosoever will"" and the nonelect are the ""whosoever wont's.""  Whether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its practical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, ""Ye would not.""    Now, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be Christians.  Have you ever said to somebody, ""I don't believe in hell.  I believe in the religion of Jesus.""  But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven!  ""Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount.""  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the mount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire.  Several times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over in the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah.  Not Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God.  The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't want to see them go there.  Now, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus, not some angry Baptist preacher, that said, ""where the worm never dies, and where the fire never goes out.""  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell a ""furnace of fire.""  It was Jesus that used the word, ""condemnation.""  ""And this is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.    How can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?  Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about.  When my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, ""outer darkness.""    Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a party.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it ""outer darkness.""  ""Outer"" -away from God.  ""Darkness"" -God is light.    No when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my son would say, an ""awesome"" thought.    ""My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?""  Hell is isolation.  There's no fellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace in hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in hell.    ""I thirst.""  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it eternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost.    In a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life ministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the illustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to Jack.  ""They sing these songs and read Bible verses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think God would send me to hell?""  Jack answered by saying, ""Yes I think he would!""  Of course the barber said, ""What do you mean by that.""  ""Well if you can't stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd be miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what you really are.""   It makes a man think.  The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask me how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He died, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the ""whosoever wills.""  He suffered eternal judgment.    A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying ""Everybody is going to be saved eventually.""  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate them.  The sheep from the goats.  "".After you die there's a probationary period in which God prepares you for heaven.""  No, my Bible says that ""It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment.""  Some of the cultist believe in annihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished out.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven.    I don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy listening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a place called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found it.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed us in a ""uni""verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications.  1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others.  Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out.  ""Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we persuade men.""  2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful chance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if you are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and suffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like Dirty Harry said, ""You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do you?""  ""A man's got to know his limitations.""  Don't be one of the ""whosoever wont's.""  "	0
"  This is one of the differences between OT prophecy and NT prophecy.  In the NT, it is expected that when believers gather,   - people will prophesy   - the prophecy must be judged (1 Cor 14:29) There is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake.   Scripture is scripture; there is no ""gift of scripture"".  And I don't know about you, but I know that _I_ have made mistakes while filled with the spirit.  If you don't give grace to allow people to make mistakes, they will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts!  When we minister in my small group, I encourage people to speak out any impressions or images they think might be from the Lord.  Only by trying will they know whether they were right or wrong -- and in either case, they'll have a better handle on it the next time.  Didn't you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle?  But you kept on trying, and you learned both from your failures and your successes. Spiritual gifts are no different -- you get better with experience.   The canon of Scripture is complete.  Does this mean that God no longer speaks?  I have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), but clearly nonetheless.  Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture?  No.  I have never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the Lord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are mature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow believers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judging prophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.  The canon is closed -- but God is not silent!   Does it matter what it is called?  The question is not how to label it, but how to receive it.  Words of knowledge, incidentally, are similar to prophecy (and sometimes the two overlap), but generally it is supernatural knowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise."	0
Praise God!  I'm writing everyone to inform you that I have been accepted to the Doctor of Psychology program at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, CA.  I've been working long and hard to try to get in there and have said many hours of prayer.  I'm very excited for this opportunity, but also very nervous about it.  I'd appreciate the prayers of the readers of this group for my preparation for school this summer and for my career as a graduate student.  I'd also appreciate any information any of the readers of this group might have  about Fuller, Pasadena, or California in general, like good places to have fun, good churches to check out, or anything else that might be good for me to know.  Also, if anyone knows of any foundations that  might have funding or scholarship money available, please let me know! Of course, if you wish to make a personal contribution.....:)  The contract for my current job is over at the end of April.  I'll be taking a couple classes at UT this summer and then I'll be moving to Pasadena.  Hopefully, I'll be able to get net.access next fall, although Fuller doesn't have it itself.  I've enjoyed the interesting discussions and I commend everyone for their earnest search to please God.  Thanks to our moderator for providing such a wonderful service and in doing a great job of running this news group.  May God bless you all.  Vaya con Dios, mi amigas y amigos.

"  I realize I'm entering this discussion rather late, but I do have one question. Wasn't it a Reagan appointee, James Watt, a pentacostal christian (I think) who was the secretary of the interior who saw no problem with deforestation since we were ""living in the last days"" and ours would be the last generation to see the redwoods anyway?

" Having met Peter Kingston (of WBT) some years back, he struck me  as an exemplery and dedicated Christian whose main concern was with translation of the Word of God and the welfare of the people group he was serving. WBT literature is concerned mainly with providing Scripture in minority languages.  The sort of criticism leveled at an organisation such as this along the lines of ""ideological manipulation and cultural interference"" is probably no more than Christianising and education - in this WBT will stand alongside the early Christian missionaries to parts of Africa, or those groups who worked among native Americans a couple hundred years ago.  I think you need to substantiate these attacks as being a legitimate criticism of priorities other than spreading the gospel among underdeveloped people."	0
" So what's your point?  Mark's comment still is valid.  To suggest that AIDS is ""deserved"" IS ludicrous.  I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from  sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided  the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.  To willingly judge ""others"" as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.      So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in ""deviant"" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors, many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors carry the risk of transmission.      The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so I could get AIDS.  Anyone could, unless they remain forever celibate, IV-drug-free, and transfusion free.  Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com) -- "	0
" If you would bother to check in any good dictioanry or thesaurus, I think you will find that ""arrogance"" has to do with an offensive exhibition of presumed or real superiority (a paraphrase from my own Webster's). Arrognace is about pride and haughtiness. A person can believe in absolute truth, even blindly (whatever that means) without being obnoxious about it. Just as a person can be a ""humble,"" authority-questioning, defying-any-theist-to-reply athiest and be quite arrogant. Arrogance is not about what you believe, it is about how you relate to what you believe and how you present it to others. If your overwhelming experience of Christians has been that they are arrogant, I apologozing both for myself and on the behalf of those who have offfended you. But my own experience, at least in forums like Usenet where you see a good mix of people, is that arrogant Christians and athiests seems to occur in about equal numbers.  - Phil -"	0

" John 1:1 says (NKJV - the little green gideon someone forced on me one day) ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was  God.""  The Word refers to Jesus Christ so from this John declares that God and Jesus are one.  Therefore, ""The Lord"" refers to both.  Also, David in the Psalms refers to both God in heaven and the coming messiah as his Lord.  Once again this refers to God and Jesus.     swear/curse?  Does it say anything about this in the bible?

Who may dwell in your holy hill?

" I strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation. That's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.  I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I deign from commenting much further.   Now hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute, but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.    Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably* determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The  distinction is subtle yet important.  When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken, without sacrificing his convictions.  Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty. Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered, ""Cogito, ergo sum,"" yet we have not advanced much beyond that.  Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course, you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability  that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do)  abandon these absolutes.   As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to  render all doubts unreasonable. "	0

"ddavis@cass.ma02.bull.com (Dave Davis)    II. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they are not quoted by the NT authors.  That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book of Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the  apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.     III. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)    parts of the canon.     then I answer:     These is a logically invalid *a priori*.     Besides, we are talking about OT texts-     which in many parts are superceded by the NT    (in the Xtian view). Would not this same    principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?    This principle cannot be consistently applied.   I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one voice, and he does not contradict himself.    The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example, the Lutheran hymn ""Now Thank We All Our God"" quotes a passage from this book.  The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.  And that is where this sort of discussion ultimately ends."	0
"  Gifts of the Spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior. A lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs.  Jesus said that people would come to Him saying ""Lord, Lord,"" and proclaiming the miraculous works they had done in His name.  Jesus would tell them that they were workers of iniquity that do not know Him, and to depart from Him.    That is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexual sin.  If the Holy Spirit were only given to the morally perfect, He would not be given to me, or any of us.  God can forgive any sin, if we repent. But people should be careful not to think, ""God has given me a gift of the Spirit, it must be okay to be gay.""  That is dangerous (see also hebrews 6 about those who have partaken of the Holy Spirit and of the powers of  the world to come.)   Jesus doesn't ask us to change our own nature.  We cannot lift ourselves out of our own sin- but we must submit to His hand as He changes our nature.  Practicing homosexual acts and homosexual lusts violates the morality that God has set forth.    If you don't believe that, and think those of us who do are just ignorant, then at least consider us weak in the faith and be celebate for our sake's. Is practicing homosexuality worth the cost of a soul, whether it be the homosexual's or the one considered ""ignorant?"""	0

I was wondering if anyone knew any changes to the temple ceremony within the last fifty years.... Also, why do you think they were made (revelation,  assimilation to mainstream Christianity, etc.)? I know that the God Makers was published quite a while ago.  Could rituals have been changed since then?  I am also very interested in the influence of Freemasonry on early Mormonism, especially in the Smith family and  in the Nauvoo settlement.  Info on any new studies would  be appreciated.  Thanks, 	0
  First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I am threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all, although I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.   My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.   People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.   This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?   I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.	0
"I've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington,  I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of  etymology.  I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my  childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes.   I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very  angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It  carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some  time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and  `Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To  become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would  consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared  to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a  better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable  riches of knowing Christ.  As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that  they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time  they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They  didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.   For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.    When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her  death, she said to me, ""As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew.""  What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a  Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with  matzoh balls.:-))   I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My  sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who  do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people  Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.  This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their  experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while  following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.    I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.   It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have  a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small  sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it  and do not want to ask for it back.  And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.   I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the  Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is  that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again,  being rooted in the past.   This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess  around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of  Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.  I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all  believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish  Christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. "	0
"  The argument for Luke's genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According to Luke 3:23     And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about     thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,    the son of Eli,  Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible interpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother. Clearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son of Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at straws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no intention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have named her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.  The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's son, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:     And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born    Jesus, who is called Christ.   There are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David, Solomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph relavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was not Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite correct, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.  The second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not involved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this work.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they had not ""known""each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant to Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.  To the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more problems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating  the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and  the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two  stories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external documents, and the discussion of ""how this could be"" might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the details are described in Steiner's ""The Spiritual Guidance of the Human  Being and of Humanity"", ""The Gospel of St. Luke"", and ""The Gospel of St. Matthew"".   Whether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted as valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.  As for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was never an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's Jewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from David, the king."	0
"Heres the life of St. MAria Goretti, posted with kind permission of the editor of the Australian Catholic Magazine ""Morning Star"".  Hope you like it.      Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti        Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,     the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful     girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but     one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.      The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on     the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-     nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally     arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and     give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon     on the  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love     we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to     die rather than commit a mortal sin.      Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy     Eucharist. Her  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's     absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the rest  of  the     day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is     until         -4-            her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.     Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.      Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling     little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her     mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband, Maria     took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.     She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the     Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning     a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other     children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she     did the Holy Will of God.      During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son) twice     made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On     both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's     strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she     even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria lived     in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.       On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  ""get  a     handkerchief,""  as he  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath     the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the     baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered     what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a     91/2""  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told     him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He     stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia     instantly realized what he was up to. ""No, No, No! Do  not touch     me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!"" At this point Alessandro     held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.      ""Will you or will you not?"" Maria gathered all her energy. ""No I     will  not, Alessandro,  no!""   She had chosen her martyrdom over     sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the     knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to     his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the     knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying     of the baby Teresa on  the  landing  brought  the attention  to     Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended     and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find     Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.     When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   ""He     wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.""      The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro away.     As the  ambulance carried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd     followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for     poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First     Communion         -5-            came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.     He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  ""Yes.  For the     love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me     in Paradise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have."" Maria     died at about three o'clock.      Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but     because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in     prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-     ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of     a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to     him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-     don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony     in Maria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,     on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the     first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation.      May St. Maria Goretti help us  to be  pure  and  grant  us  the     strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.      Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.       by Brendan Arthur "	0

Desiree Bradley (Desiree_Bradley@mindlink.bc.ca) asked us whether we should think of the Serbs as doing God's work in Bosnia.  I've refrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with the OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say something.  Many things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the Gospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break down these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If Moslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill them.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions. There are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are living together peacefully.  The precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two different things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into Canaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have promised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be a holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those attacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be defeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once that was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were expected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of agreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy war.  The other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by Assyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel for her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a judgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay of the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because illness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God for good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't justify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that in attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as *unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's people, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were actually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action. Furthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are judgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through his prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to Bosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting, I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that doesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from judgement.	0
"Mark Ashley's account of private revelation does not, as some might think, contradict my posting in which I said that the Catholic Church believes that public revelation, on which Catholic doctrine is based, ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  In that posting I made sure I used the word ""public"".  Public revelation contains God's truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak directly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the Virgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed. Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations, but doctrines can not.  When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)  I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in evaluating an alleged private revelation--it's not something I need every day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything known through public revelation ------- Marty Helgesen Bitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu"	0

"  And yet, Jayne,  as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus himself spoke on, Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more than heaven itself.  Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev, chapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word ""throne"" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the assignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are already judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.  There is no recourse, excuse or defense.  Yes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to extremes before stopping at ""moderation.""  I think we have seen the extreme of the ""hell fire & brimstone"" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones sensibilities.  I forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a story.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the point of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or hell.  He believed everybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to pray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man wouldn't do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don't believe in hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't exist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And yet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.  I'd use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it.  When I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that isn't called, oi vey!.  What's with that ref that he didn't make that call.  It's unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which is still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness which includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life, then broad is the way to distruction.   I think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all, repentance isn't only a turning towards, but also a turning away from! No, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we should do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.    I have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its eternality.  1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness. 2) Dignity of Man.  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature.    If responsible, then he is also accountable. 3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God. 4) Christ.  He was willing to die and go there Himself to offer an avenue to    the ""whosoever will."""	0
" In the Bible, there are a lot of instances where God speaks to people, where a person just ""came to know"" some piece of information, where a person walks off into the desert for ""40 days"", etc. With all of God's power He certainly can do whatever He wants when He wants it. The Bible ""ends"" with the book of Revelations. But does God's reign end there ? No. So who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer happening or still happening ?  I can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-) With the cold response I've gotten from the past from this group, it's very hard to get the point across. I'll only go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look at documents stored somewhere. I've cited the uncorrupted bodies of saints before. They're still there. 8-) The apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle specifically granted to show God's existence. That was the spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several countries. That event is ""approved"" by the Pope. Currently, images of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa are showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under investigation by the Church. But realize that investigations take decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come in ten days, that's a bit too late, isn't it 8-). Other events under investigation are inner locutions (""coming to know""), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ's wounds. And they don't heal. And doctor's don't know why). Non-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I'm sure.  This stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M or God will call me home). It's free. Find out why they're happening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody can figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion. If you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned. These are not ""members only"" events. God and Mary invites  everybody.  So in conclusion (finally) ... We RC's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary. We are scared to death sometimes although we're told not to. There are more proofs and events. And that is why ""not everything is in the Bible"". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told to read the Bible.  As far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned... In the end, God's churches will unite. I'm not sure how. I have some idea. But the point is we shouldn't worry about the ""versus"" part. Just do God's work. That's all that matters. Unity will come.  BTW, I'm just a plain person. I'm not the Pope's spokesperson. But I am RC.  -- "	0

I hope, though, that most American citizens have the basic knowlege of the structure of American government to understand the relationship between the Justice Department as a part of the Executive Branch, and the Courts, which are of the Judicial Branch.   Marc's ignorance of basic civic knowlege underscores his inability to comprehend and interpret foreign affairs.   	1
 Of course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more difficult.  You have not bothered to substantiate this in any way.  Basil, do you know of any evidence that would support this?  I can just imagine a news report from ancient times, if Hasan had been writing it.  Newsflash: Cairo AP (Ancient Press).  Israel today denied Egypt acces to the Red Sea.  In a typical display of Israelite agressiveness, the leader of the Israelite slave revolt, former prince Moses, parted the Red Sea. The action is estimated to have caused irreparable damage to the environment. Egyptian authorities have said that thousands of fisherman have been denied their livelihood by the parted waters.  Pharaoh's brave charioteers were successful in their glorious attempt to cause the waters of the Red Sea to return to their normal state.

Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as   ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work   of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.   Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts   into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable   and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets   completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for   howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the   scattered bones of the dead.""

It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us   create for ourselves.

The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.  A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri  town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to  have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military  operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the  Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been  massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten  and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed  the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian  insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the Karabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City  hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant  were killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to  condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its  sovereignty.  Serdar Argic"	1
" Yes it is, as has been evidenced by the previous two stages of withdrawal from the area and by the reductions in troops. Currently the troops are kept at a level consistent with light and armored patrols.  No permanent installations have been built in the area, nor are any planned.  As to the prodigal ""water question"",  you can continue to waste your time looking for non-existent proof, or you can accept the testimony of people here, some Lebanese, who have acknowledged that they know of no evidence for these allegations.   It depends which of those territories you refer to. In general, settlers were moved into the territories because at the time, in the context of the situations, it seemed the logical move.  This is not to say that views don't change or that mistakes are not made.  Currently, I would say that the only ""disputed territory"" that does not appear to be temporary is that of Eastern and northern Jerusalem.  "	1
"  Very simple.  ""X-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide   against 2.5 million Muslims by admitting to the crime and making   reparations to the Turks and Kurds.""  After all, your criminal grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920.   <C5yyBt.5zo@news.cso.uiuc.edu> hovig@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Hovig Heghinian)   You must be a new 'Arromdian'. You are counting on ASALA/SDPA/ARF  crooks and criminals to prove something for you? No wonder you are in  such a mess. That criminal idiot and 'its' forged/non-existent junk has  already been trashed out by Mutlu, Cosar, Akgun, Uludamar, Akman, Oflazer  and hundreds of people. Moreover, ASALA/SDPA/ARF criminals are responsible  for the massacre of the Turkish people that also prevent them from entering  Turkiye and TRNC. SDPA has yet to renounce its charter which specifically  calls for the second genocide of the Turkish people. This racist, barbarian  and criminal view has been touted by the fascist x-Soviet Armenian government  as merely a step on the road to said genocide.   Now where shall I begin?  #From: ahmet@eecg.toronto.edu (Parlakbilek Ahmet) #Subject: YALANCI, LIAR : DAVIDIAN #Keywords: Davidian, the biggest liar #Message-ID: <1991Jan10.122057.11613@jarvis.csri.toronto.edu>  Following is the article that Davidian claims that Hasan Mutlu is a liar:       [some parts are deleted]         - - -     Receiving this message, I checked the reference, L.Kuper,""Genocide..."" and what I have found was totally consistent with what Davidian said.The book was like ""voice of Armenian revolutionists"" and although I read the whole book, I could not find the original quota.

As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source   given by Serdar Argic ..      You couldn't reject it...      Here we go again..  In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give   the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!  (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of  pages, please ask by sct)      I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924) What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your groundless accussations, etc.    [...]      I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)  and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published  in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you  are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..    Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)    First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You  called Serdar Argic a liar!..  I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...  (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)    And now, you are lying again and talking about ""modified,re-published book"" (without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..  (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was   first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty    well suited theories', as usual)    And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who  wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number  and page numbers again for the library use, which are:                    949.6 R 198       and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215                           Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying ""it is  not possible..."" ..If not, what is your point?    Differences in the number of pages?  Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..  No need to use the same book size and the same letter   charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!    The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year  first published..   And you tried to hide the whole point..  the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about  how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given   by Serdar Argic exist!!   It was the issue, wasn't-it?      you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway?     You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a ""crap""..

Also, feel  free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists, the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian criminal organizations.  Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide.

Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-Soviet Armenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion  of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical  documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs,  was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors,  program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and  radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide  of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people  of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the  lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is  mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their  lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations  may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and  prosperously.  ------------------------- letter ----------------------------------  During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which  not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the  method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day,  Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order  to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland,  which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia  continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish  Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its  terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks  to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically  exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on  this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of  governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition  of the Turkish Genocide.  With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide demand:  1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian  Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;  2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people;  3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for  their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;  4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure;  5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it  has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially  recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be  supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;  6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact  of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of  2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.  The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first  genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new  generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically mature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through all necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the  armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in  the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.

"      Homeland? First Nagarno-Karabagh was Armenians homeland today  Fizuli, Lacin and several villages (in Azerbadjan)  are their homeland. Can't you see the  the  ""Great Armenia"" dream in this? With facist methods like  killing, raping and bombing villages. The last move was the   blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees, trying to  escape the from Lacin, a city that was ""given"" to the Kurds  by the Armenians.      Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes  were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities  announced that they were going to search these cargo   planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany.  5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of  of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not  humanitarian aid.....   Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.  Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons  to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan  it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons  since it's content is announced to be weapons?      "	1
" ""fete""??? Since this word both formally and commonly refers to positive/joyous events, your misuse of it here is rather unsettling.    I certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that are abusive towards the Palestinians/Gazans. Given that, however, there  *is no comparison* between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in  Gaza.    Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying  entity to maintain order, especially in the face of elements that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure.  Ironically, international law recognizes each of these focusses (that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are  inherently in conflict.  Israel certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present policies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third  alternative- the creation and implementation of a jewish ""dhimmi"" system with Gazans/Palestinians as benignly ""protected"" citizens. Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with regard to Islam's policies towards its minorities?    It is a race, then? Between Israel's anti-Palestinian/Gazan ""Final Solution"" and the Arab World's anti-Israel/jewish ""Final Solution"". Do you favor one? neither?   Since there is justifiable worry by various parties that Israel and Arab/Palestinian ""final solution"" intentions exist, isn't it important that BOTH Israeli *and* Palestinian/Gazan ""rights"" be secured?

  That still doesn't mean we should cheer their deaths.  Policemen are also in  the line of fire and their job includes the possibility of getting killed.   Should we be happy when they die?  As I said before, the question is not whether or not you agree with the policies of Israel.  You may wish for the Israelis to cease occupation, but don't rejoice in death. 	1

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan- ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the  physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had  an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas ornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this  went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and  was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into tears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .  Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I  want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am  silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling me, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the one whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place,  telling him, ""I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring  her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse."" He went and returned empty handed, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his  apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were  walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls.  There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.  They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I  went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be  cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the  doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth,  opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle  Sabir's son started to shout, ""Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!"" He  knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma.  Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their  apartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying delirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother. All of my family had gathered there.     At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the apartment.  Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, ""Lyuda,  Karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes  you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful."" It was as though her whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one  side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her  cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole microdistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, ""Fine."" Mamma was  afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started  to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the bed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye  that was intact, looked at me, and said, ""Who is it?"" But I could barely talk,  my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something tender, something incomprehensible, but tender, ""My Karochka, my Karina, my  little golden one . . . "" She understood me.  Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips.  She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't  understand it. Then I made out, ""It hurts, I hurt all over."" Her hair was  glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her  forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how  to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's saying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil  and paper and says, ""Write it down."" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I  can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me  something, but she couldn't. I say, ""Karina, just lie there a little while, then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then."" And then she says, ""Maybe it'll be too late."" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't control myself.  Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She  says, ""Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this  damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need to call Urshan."" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I  understood her every word. I ask, ""What's his number?"" Urshan Feyruzovich,  that's the head of the administration where she works. ""We have to call him.""  But I didn't know his home number. I say, ""Karina, what's his number?"" She  says, ""I can't remember."" I say, ""Who knows his number? Who can I call?"" She  says, ""I don't know anything, leave me alone.""  I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was  crying, too. I say, ""Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can  we call him? Who knows his telephone number?"" I tell Marina, ""Think, think,  who can we call to find out?"" She started calling; several people didn't  answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and  found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he  was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says,  ""Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and  tell them that they just can't do that."" She still didn't know what was really going on. I said, ""It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's  happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single  Armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised  that we managed to save ourselves. ""She says, ""Well, OK, if it's that serious  . . . "" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up  and that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. ""OK,  fine, fine,"" she says, ""if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back  I'll send him over.""  We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly  under Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She  wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed  everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on trying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and  finally we get through. She says, ""Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your  place now."" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either,  because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep  with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what  shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has  grown up daughters, they're almost my age.  The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and went down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No,  first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around eleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I  saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies . . . everything just like a war.  They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older  Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud  she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle  Arkady, I think, because someone said ""Arkady, get an injection ready,"" he  started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But  when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his  sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and  started to cry: ""What have they done to you?!"" He was speaking Armenian. ""What have they done to you?!"" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and  she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. ""I'll give you a shot.""  Mamma tells him, ""I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what  are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people, and you're just sitting here!"" Some teacups were standing on the table in  there. ""You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my  daughters! Look what they've turned them into!"" They gave her something to  drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa  and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina  out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I  don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: ""What's  the matter with you?"" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's. I said, ""I'm fine."" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told  the doctor, ""You leave, let a woman examine her."" A woman came, an  Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, ""What's wrong with you?"" I was wearing my  sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When  she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would  be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge  wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said  something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be  dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.  They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me.  I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't  know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, ""Lie still, you mustn't move."" When I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed  very familiar to me. I shouted, ""Stop!"" One of the policemen turned and says,  ""What do you want?"" I say, ""Bring him to me, I want to look at him."" They  brought him over and I said, ""That person was just in our apartment and he  just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down."" They said,  ""Fine,"" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were  taking him.  Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were  sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car  up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, ""Sister . . . "" I don't  remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they did to us. I asked him, ""Where are you from?"" He said that he was from Ufa.  Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I  learned that they suffered most of all. He says, ""OK, you're Armenians, they  didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,"" he says, ""what are they trying  to kill me for?"" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the  balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw  two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed  against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him with his own club. The way he cried ""Mamma"" made my skin crawl. I don't know  what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before  he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was  Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with  someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the  yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.  They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too  and said, ""I've been beaten too, help me."" But they just ignored her. My  father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault  that he'd been beaten, and says, ""My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have  probably broken my ribs. Please look at them."" The doctor says, ""That's not my job."" Urshan said, ""Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor,  I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them  to his apartment.  Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the  doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I  wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy-- coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she, having examined Karina, said, ""No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like  they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women. ""Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same  story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no  drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at  zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from  seeing it.  They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have  any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their  place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira  her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And Ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed. When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she  involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again. Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful  when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, ""Do what you want with me, just leave my daughter alone."" Well, they did what they  wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I  would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It  was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do  every day: steal, kill, rape . . .  Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts  explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those  children would be grown, and then, as they put it, ""we'll come take the  pleasure out of their lives, those children."" This was about the girls that would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow  because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be  of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the  victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they themselves said that.  And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many  people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know  why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before,  maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and  they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at  nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with  Marina: ""Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over  there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman  shouldn't see such things."" So they were really quite sober . . .  So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all  happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several  hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk- ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he thought no one is listening: ""Listen,"" he'll say, ""what could I do? What could I do alone, how could I protect them?"" I don't know where to find the words, it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen.  That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of  course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.  On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital. First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city,  the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier.  There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family  there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They  were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife  and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.  Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard. There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area. They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide. The women were shouting. They explained to them: ""We want to hide you better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.""  We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to  have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful.  They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you  could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the  police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is  surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were  standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought  great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't  just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48, or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost  family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened  when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret  room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at one another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those  people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the  hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my  parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should  attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an  Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and  she wouldn't be able to take it.  Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people  climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers. They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We  calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some  little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never  have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people  do eat.  Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They  were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from  the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a  different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing,  and calling out: ""Oh, Rafik!,"" but when she heard about this such a rage came  over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her  sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were  soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash  him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not  one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from  doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands,  muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing  terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the  creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did  this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She  went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women,  ""What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they  raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though  nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?"" She appealed to everyone, but no  one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I  could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so  many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the  elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time.  There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking.  The situation was deplorable.  At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen,  Azerbaijanis. They said, ""Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up and put the children to bed."" Now the women didn't want to leave this place,  either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with  dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, ""Oh, it's our little  family,"" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for  the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded machine guns in their hands, said, ""Grandmother, you mustn't approach me, I'm on guard."" Our people would say, ""Oh, that's all right."" They hugged them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.  They took us up to the second floor and said, ""You can undress and sleep in  here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city."" This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I  asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me. I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, ""Don't worry, the Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest assured. I say, ""Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in there is capable of anything.""  When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi- tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met  acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who  hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with  them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had  come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like  they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people,  hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of  course the stories and the talk were flying: ""Oh, I heard that they killed  him!"" ""What do you mean they killed him!"" ""He stayed at work!"" ""Do you know  what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.  And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very  well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small  room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night  talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary  of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see  Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed  from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask  him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by  soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with  the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.  Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, ""Lyudochka, find another  two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs,  lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people  who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned."" I  had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, ""Lyuda, your  Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are  alive and well and that you're here."" I gave the lists to someone and asked  them to continue what I was doing and went off.  The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels Grigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the  name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said  that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later  it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for  Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that  in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored  missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3  All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were  contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple  of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, ""What's  going on?"" He said, ""Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it was one or fifty."" They told him that the list had disappeared and they should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26 was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because that's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26  people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only  a half of those that were on the first list. He said, ""Lyuda, please, try to remember at least one more."" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people  whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many  people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the  Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that  there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical  Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk  cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went  to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the  Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list  drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course don't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to  publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court,  they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No.  8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know  her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in  Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the  same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding  the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and  when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her  braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because  they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one  . . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.  They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there  and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina;  it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could  already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the  social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said,  ""If it weren't for the work I would go insane."" He and I put ourselves in gear and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers  and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything,  although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been  dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it  was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.  On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir Fedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered  only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital. Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.  Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I  told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind.  We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the conditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor  quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there  weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a  curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or  video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that  we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially  to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to  Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with  Bibishev, I told him myself, ""Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two  months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in those two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.""  He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her- self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x- rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we were in Baku already, the investigator told me, ""How long can you go on like  this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this investigation through. We need you."" Then I started eating, because in fact I was exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart- ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement cells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of Sumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary  confinement.  Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma  identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify  anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the  photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one  who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the  loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know  his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his  sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that  even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will  continue looking for him.  The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various  plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect. Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only one of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and Chemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga- tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front of me ""I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash simply for keeping him out of Armenia,"" that is, to keep him from landing in a prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological pressure--they say, ""Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an Armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you in short order."" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.  The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was  in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and  all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned  them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James  Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were  boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had  been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's  enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't even know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did  take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out  slippers.  Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait.  Basically, the group that went seeking ""revenge""--let's use their word for  it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with  one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that  black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of  Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently arrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I  don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an  Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know  nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an  axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and  threw them into the tub with water.  I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You  know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both  their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey- eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I  identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born in the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How  did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I  kept thinking, is that Rita or ""puma,"" which it would be if you read the word  as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic ""T"" was the one  that looks like a Latin ""M."" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind his back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and  told me that I was making a mistake, and called me ""dear sister."" He said,  ""You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an  Armenian,"" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator  asked me, ""Lyuda, are you sure it was he?"" I told him, ""I'll tell you one more identifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The  name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand."" He went rigid and became  pale. They told him, ""Put your hands on the table."" He put his hands on the table with the palms up. I said, ""Now turn your hands over,"" but he didn't  turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they  forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently. But he insolently stuck to his story, ""No, I did not do anything, it wasn't  me."" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out  of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it.  Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and  back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how,  but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or  strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the  microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his last name, and he says, ""Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . . "" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped.  They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down,  because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, ""You're  some actress! What a performance!"" I said, ""Tolya, honestly . . . "" Beforehand they would always tell me, ""Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if  nothing had happened to you."" I say, ""I don't have any more strength or  emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength  . . . I don't have the strength to do anything."" And he says, ""Lyuda, how were you able to do that?"" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching the tape, I said, ""Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped  that high in gym class.""  So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of  the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who  beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.  At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his  guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said,  ""Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three o'clock."" He said, ""No, I'm not coming."" They told him, ""If you don't come  we'll kill you."" He said, ""Alright, I'll come."" And he went.  They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a  motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him  out of his apartment and told him the same thing: ""Tomorrow we're going to get the Armenians. Be there."" He said, ""No."" They pulled a knife on him. He said,  ""I'm not going all the same."" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed  him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that  we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.  I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning of Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our  apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our  apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I  don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked out very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the courtyard, he remained in the apartment.  At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't  have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.  The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't call them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, ""I don't  understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head."" But we know that they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam-- that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do. Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they  crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were  promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments. So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, ""they  promised us apartments.""  Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a  children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at  the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they  have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or  grandparents. And he said, ""I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my  own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing."" And the whole time I kept repeating, ""Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife  right before your own eyes."" He sat there and just wailed.  But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a  marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just  have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how  to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he  knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed  himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.  That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr  Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, ""Let's go, enough, you've spilled enough blood here.""  Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was  that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They  liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When  Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors  old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to  the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were  already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have  sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older  woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of  Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off. The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands  and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth,  he sees everything, and He won't forgive this.  There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first  floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them. But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is  tantamount to trampling a woman's honor.  Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we  have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these  events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come  about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that  without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not  have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis, let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their  nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are  a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they  threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done, to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone  who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got as far away as their legs would carry them.  February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came  into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had  been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for  a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few  teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or  seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there  were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the  evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and  the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the  microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the  driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: ""Death to the Armenians! They must be killed!"" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because  people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The  woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians  cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, ""Sons, avenge my daughters!"" That  was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the  direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.  We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a  very nationalist speech. He said, ""Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!"" This  he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him  stormily, whistling and shouting ""Karabagh!"" He said, ""Karabagh has been our  territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my  heart?"" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. ""It's our  territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated.  From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years  the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth."" By filth he meant  Armenians.  I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely. Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with  the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate, that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our teachers said, ""Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's  spouting,"" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we  listened to the woman's speech.  Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the  subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of studies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to  obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me, ""Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If  they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I  tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?"" When he  said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a  second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered,  ""No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until  twelve. Stay here."" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in  kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: ""I left my  children at the kindergarten."" The director excused her. When she let her go I turned around, said, ""Good-bye,"" and left with the young teacher, the  Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.  When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too  much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed  off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher  wouldn't say that I was an Armenian.  To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at  the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched  television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last  day. That's how it all was.  At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together, Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store  on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she  doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father  held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the  ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went  out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the  entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders  there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the  moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been  injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor,  and their children: any way they could.   Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin,  Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims  what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one  another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even  with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and  their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got  them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked  electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then  they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an  Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to  escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of  course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The  Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored  personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored  personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that  very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.  I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big,  strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a  strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.  One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking  for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected,  people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps  dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went  with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found  Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and  put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or  infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the  neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject  came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the  basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing  as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor  took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything  seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing  of ours he had managed to ""save.""  Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended  themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were Azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some  reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just  victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too.  In the TV show ""Pozitsiya"" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that  the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not  important, the truth will come out regardless.  So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our  bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the  years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've  become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.  On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans  will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the  Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga- tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on  the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear speaking our native tongue.

Organization: Aiken Computation Lab, Harvard University Keywords:     Israel has a right to keep Jerusalem for many reasons.  They include the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, the fact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and the historical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.   When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948, the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit religious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan, who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  The Jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned a Jewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in their latrines.   Israel has allowed individuals of all religions into Jerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness to control the city.   Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered in Jerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca, where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).  Unlike Israeli Jerusalem, Jews and Christians are not allowed in Saudi Mecca.  Adam  Adam Shostack            adam@das.harvard.edu	1
"WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi  SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to ""the extermination of the Jewish race""--went on display Friday at the National Archives.  The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the Holocaust is a myth, archivists say.  ""The notes give them their authenticity,"" said Robert Wolfe, a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  ""He was supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his own rules.""  The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.  Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than 100 German secret police generals.  ""I also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly. I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been written and is never to be written.""  [Emphasis mine--rje]  The German word Himmler uses that is translated as ""extermination"" is *Ausrottung*.  Wolfe said a more precise translation would be ""extirpation"" or ""tearing up by the roots.""  In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism, ""Judenevakuierung"" or ""evacuation of the Jews.""  But archives officials said ""extermination"" is the word he actually spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.  Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's ""final solution of the Jewish question,"" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.  The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum here on April 26.  The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.   ---From p.A10 of Saturday's L.A.

From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis   To:  shaig@Think.COM  Subject: Ten questions to Israelis  Dear Shai,  Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.  In the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of Israeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have received from other quarters, according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship (Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all times and present them at many public places, almost every day. These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab. You maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ? Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose ?  In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).  Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.  Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning 'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?  You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about Israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so. I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.	1
    Why does the Center For Policy Research pose such unbelievably stupid and loaded questions to this newsgroup.  What are you? - a think tank, or a fish tank?  Every time I start to believe I have seen the outer boundaries of your stupidity, you come up with one step beyond.  When will it end, man?  Can you actually have brain enough to dress and feed yourself each morning?  	1
  There is something almost comical in the fact that Yigal Arens is  important enough to have the ADL and G-d knows who else sifting through his  garbage (which happens to be legal; you throw it out, it ain't yours any more).   This brings to mind a few possibilities other than the ADL connection:   - it is all in Arens' mind.  - Bullock may have been working for Arens' friend in the PLO  - Arens' father (or is it brother?) Moshe Arens (former Israeli Defense  Minister) was spying on him.  - Arens hired Bullock to spy on him to get attention.   In any case, who cares?	1
   How would you deal with Arabs who ALWAYS threaten to drive you into the sea or burn half your conuntry?  Would you talk nicely?  Would you say please?  You wouldn't.  The language of the middle east is power and force.  Sorry - that is the way it is now.  If you aren't strong, you go down.  Israel has to talk  and act tough.  Notice, Israel talks and acts tough in battle, but is willing to talk peace.    True - and they have brainwashed their people into thinking Jews are some sort of monsters.  Arab non-recognition of Israel and support of war and terror is also an important factor, wouldn't you say?   What do you want Israel to do?  They are negotating? I'm sick of people calling for Israel to withdraw from the territories now.  That's not realistic, don't you realize that?  A solution must be negotiated.  It is on the table.  Have patience.  	1

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed    to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their    plan !     (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity    since it was coined by Bnai Brith)     What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,    is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic    Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in    Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.     However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their    homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political    thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the    Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.     As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.     Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true    super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the    Jews used to establish their state : Religion.      Ahmed.  Forget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is that the PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist. This is perfectly obvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls for the destruction of the ""Zionist entity"". As far as I know the Israel-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies the purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I can post the relevant caluses.  Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. I know it has been posted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I am sure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more than happy to repost it.  Regardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, and even the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the very heart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel.  It just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson's suggestion that Jews support people envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing one to many Jews."	1
"  Ahhh, of course. Israeli morality pales in the face of charming events  like the string of PLO-run skyjackings in the mid 80's (remember those  TWA jokes?), and not to forget the Achille Lauro and however many airline bombings they have committed, not to mention bombings on the streets of  Israel (It's gotten to a point where children are told not to go near any bags or containers whose origins they don't know, because they could be  bombs), or last weeks Katyusha rocket attack on Northern Israel by Fatah, those wonderful ""mainstream moderates"" with whom Israel is attempting to negotiate.  Let's not forget the fact that more Palestinians are killed by Palestinians than by Israelis.  Ahh yes, those charming humanitarian death squads. I've actually seen a videotape of an interrogation (DSee the documentary  _Deadly Currents_--very neutral and balanced--seriously)--It was rather  inquisition-esque. essentially, to prove his loyalty to ""the cause"" of whichever group it was that was interogating him, he had to turn in someone else, or else face death in one of the many fun-filled ways that the death- squads love so much--beatings, dismemberment, acid, pouring melted plastic on the face of the 'guilty party,' and of course beheading, always my  favorite.  Did you catch the photos in the Washington Post a while back  the execution of a ""collaborator?""  3 photos: 1) one Palestinian leading another at gunpoint. 2) The ""collaborator"" on his knees, the gun pointed at his temple. 3) The executioner standing on the corpse of the ""collaborator shouting about how this is what happens to collaborators.  Wonderful justice system, and lots of regard for Human rights. Remember Black September? Ok, so they just tried to take over Jordan, big deal.  I'm rambling now, but are you getting what I'm saying?"	1
 Dorin, Let's not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered. The distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters). Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the Lebanese people are tired of being occupied! They are now turning to the only option they see as viable. (Don't forget that it worked in driving out the US)  -marc  	1
" While that is currently true from their perspective, it is also worthwhile to note that in such cases the populace often does suffer from attempts to control the guerillas.  Furthermore, there were cases in the past of Palestinian gun emplacements being situated within villages.  The argument that can be made for small arms fire can not be made for field pieces.   As I recall, Amal was primarily nationalistically ""Lebanon for the Lebanese"" motivated.  I think that the difference between them was also a matter of funding and support.  One question does come to mind however,   Given that you claim the Hizbollah to be more committed etc... and that their stated position is:  1.  No peace talks.  2.  No peace talks.  .  .  .  .  N-1. No peace talks.  N.  No Israel  if we assume that Lebanon and Syria are sincere in their desire for peace, why hasn't the Hizbollah been disarmed?   Bearing in mind the above and that military losses are more palatable than civilian ones, I am sure you can understand why Israel is slow to act in that manner.   I agree that Syria wants Lebanon to be part of its greater Syria. I don't necessarily see that the Syrians would be unhappy to see Israel up to its neck in another Lebanese morass afterwhich Syria could continue on its merry schedule when Israeli public opinion would lead to a second pullout.   <*sigh*>  Why can't some gov'ts negotiate as easily as some people?

 Proven?  Maybe not.  But it can certainly be verified beyond a reasonable doubt.  This statement and statements like it are a matter of public record.  Before the Six Day War (1967) I think Nasser and some other Arab leaders were broadcasting these statements on Arab radio.  You might want to check out some old newspapers Ahmed.    I think if you take a look at the Hamas covenant (written in 1988) you might get a  different impression.  I have the convenant in the original arabic with a translation that I've verified with Arabic speakers.  The document is rife with calls to kill jews and spread Islam and so forth.	1
"  Don't swallow propaganda as truth Sir. British promised to Venizelos (greek PM) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will be given to Greece, _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side of the British during the WWI (because the greek King was proGerman). The British succeeded by bombarding Athens (1916), killing quite a few, forcing abdication of the King, division of Greece into two separate states (North-South), and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous division between greeks for our century.(So don't feel bitter that the ""Allies"" gave any green light because they liked us....)  Anyway, the British succeed to establish Venizelos, war starts at a second front against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the war in the East against the Russians, and finally the WWII came in an end. After that the British (and French) forgot immediately their promises (as usually). Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek cause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual ""reasoning"" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually backup Kemal (who had given now to the British ""water and bread"" that he will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small ethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan to keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion into warm-water facilities. The ""greek empire"" being an Orthodox Christian state was too prone to become Russian client.  Out of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on our lands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true ""Giants"" by the British, since they worked to realize their goals in the region. Under the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big military funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russian buffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. because otherwise the use of terror of changing ""the balance of power in the Aegean"" will be used.  Under the same exact rational you should see the Cyprus problem.  Gr"	1
It seems to me that many readers of this conference are interested who is behind the Center for Polict Research. I will oblige.  My name is Elias Davidsson, Icelandic citizen, born in Palestine. My mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables' (at that times this group was defined as 'Jews'). She was forced to go to Palestine due to many  cynical factors. I have meanwhile settled in Iceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from my homeland, Palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to the 'indesirables'). These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem with the children of whom I played as child. Their crime: Theyare not Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice, period. My work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism and racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practices in Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based on a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism from Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.  The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities undertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command the support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formal institution and works with minimal funds.  Professionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published  several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe.  I would hope that discussion about Israel/Palestine be conducted in a more civilized manner. Calling names is not helpful.	1

"  If a 'dog's prayers were answered, bones would rain from the sky. Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name?  Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians,  drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well, anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the  Nazis.   ""Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously   pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,   as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and    anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.""[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,'      Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.    As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots)  was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but  had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II. In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the  American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20 chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization. Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:   ""The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.   Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.""[1]  [1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), ""The     Armenian Displaced Persons,"" in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,     1949-50, p. 19, footnote.   Now wait, there is more.  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  ""Hojali Disaster"", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. ""We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,"" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. ""We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.""  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. ""Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,"" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. ""This  is just a small percentage of the dead,"" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. ""They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.""  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  ""There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,"" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  ""People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.""  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.

   No, you have completely misunderstood.  I was opposed to intervention in Somalia for the same reason I am opposed to intervention in Bosnia - there is no security interest of the United States there which justifies risking the lives of American servicemen, and there are too many crises in the world for us to take on all of them.  In the case of Bosnia, the risks are obviously much greater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with far better reasons to take action than the US.   You continue to misunderstand.  I did not say the reason why people want to intervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this word, btw.  I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same as racist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - I said the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result of it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and 3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which side would be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the conflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despite the fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there was considerably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv news I see are any guide. 	1
  Is this the joke of the month?   1. Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920.  2. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry during WWII.  3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children and elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last  four years.  The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the  Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians.   For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people  lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the  oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried  out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks  and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their  homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands  were empty of Turks and Kurds.   The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.  Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and  Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.  Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated  by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against  humanity.  x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide  against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations  to the Turks and Kurds.  Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine  their own future as a nation in their own homeland.  During the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate the unity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkish and Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle for that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.  Today, we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United  States and Canada to participate en masse in the Commemorative  Events, be they cultural, political or religious.   Serdar Argic	1

" [FARID] In support of the preservation of the territorial integrity of  [FARID] Azerbaijan and its independence from Russian rule, the Iranians which  [FARID] includes millions of Azerbaijanis will have Armenia retreat from the  [FARID] territory of Azerbaijan.   Oh, they will? This should prove quite interesting!  [FARID] To count on Iranian help to supposedly counter Turkish influence will  [FARID] be a fatal error on the part of Armenia as long as Armenia in  [FARID] violation of international law has Azerbaijani lands in occupation.   Armenia is not counting on Iranian help. As far as violations of international laws, which international law gives Azerbaijan the right to attack and  depopulate the Armenians in Karabakh?  [FARID] If Armenian aggression continues in the territory of Azerbaijan, not  [FARID] only there won't be any aid from Iran to Armenia but also steps will  [FARID] be taken to have Armenian army back in Armenia.   And who do you speak for? Rafsanjani?  [FARID] The Azerbaijanis of Iran will be the guarantors of this policy. As for  [FARID] scaring Iranians or Turks from the Russian power, experts on present  [FARID] and future military potentials of these people would not put much  [FARID] stock on the Russain power as the sole power in the region for long!!!   Well, Farid, your supposed experts are not expert! The Russians have had non-stop influence in the Caucasus since the Treaty of Turkmanchay in 1828. Hmm... that makes it 1993-1828 = 165 years!

[FARID] Iran is not alian to developing the capability to produce the A bomb  [FARID] and a reliable delivery system (refer to recent news releases  [FARID] regarding the potential of Iran).   So the Azeris from Iran are going to force the Armenians from Karabakh by forcing the Iranian government to drop an atomic bomb on these Armenians.  [FARID] The moral of the story is that, you don't go invading your neighbor's  [FARID] home (Azerbaijan) and flash Russia's guns when questioned about it.   Oh, but it's just fine if you drop an atomic bomb on your neighbor! You are a damn fool, Farid!  [FARID] (Marshal Shapashnikov may have to eat his words regarding Turkey in a  [FARID] few short years!).   So you are going to drop an atomic bomb on Russia as well.   [FARID] Peaceful resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is the only  [FARID] way to go. Armenia may soon find the fruits of Aggression very bitter  [FARID] indeed.  And the Armenians will take your ""peaceful"" dropping of an atomic bomb as an example of Iranian Azeri benevolence! You sir are a poor example of an  Iranian Azeri!   Ha!

"I will try to answer some of Dorin's questions, even though they were not addressed to me specifically, but I feel that I am a bit concerned by the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is  often on the receiving end of Israel's bombs. In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is  disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed  solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth. It seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant, and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation. I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of what the situation really is in South Lebanon.    I am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information we are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the  people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to imagine ????  It is NOT a ""terrorist camp"" as you and the Israelis like  to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc..... SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not  know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they are back they announce that they bombed a ""terrorist  hideout"" where an 8 year old girl just happened to be. We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is  the Israeli way of telling us that ""if you're gonna hurt our soldiers you're gonna pay the price"".  We accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young  men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers. Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING  ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real  leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw. The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a  regular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that the so called ""Security Zone"" is necessary for the protection of  Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace, than it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the  establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the best policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border.  I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled. This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to realize that the concept of a ""buffer zone"" aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel would have resulted in.   If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw  unilaterally from the so-called ""Security Zone"" before the conclusion of the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives, advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's  public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations  since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in  peace and has already offered some important concessions. Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not  accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it. There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such  circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of Lebanon.     I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.   I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make  Yes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians. The real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave Israeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an  occupying soldier is attacked.   "	1
"  So, did the Jews kill the Germans?  You even make Armenians laugh.  ""An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the  systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of   the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at   least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The   memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and   eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in  1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.'

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the  area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages.

    If the attack was justified or not is at least debatable. But this is not the issue. The issue is that you were cheering DEATH. Read again your original article. You find Israeli government responsible for those dead soldiers, that's a reasonable (debatable) point, but feel satisfaction from dead bodies is  NOT REASONABLE  by any standards. No matter how you try to justify it. I may understand your frustration against israeli occupation in S Lebanon. But no matter what you say, I can not understand your satisfaction for dead bodies.  I have a question for you. Let's assume a bosnian village, inhabited by serbs untill a few (10-20) years ago, and later taken over by bosnian muslims (the means are not very peaceful). Now, do you enjoy serbs coming and killing all (armed) bosnian muslims ? I would not enjoy, but I would not enjoy ANY dead bodies -  israelis, lebanese or bosnians. 	1

First, my above statement doesnot say that ""the existence of israeli citizens    in the WB revoke their right of life"" but it says ""the israeli occupation    of the WB revoke the right of life for some/most its citizens - basically    revokes the right of for its military men"". Clearly, occupation is an    undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate.   Ok, let me re-phrase the question. I have repeatedly asked you if the  Israelis have less human rights than the palestinians, and if so, why. From your posting (where you did not directly adress my question) I inferred that you thought so. Together with the above statement I then assumed that the reason was the actions of the state of Israel. Re: your statement of  occupation: I'd like you to define the term, so I don't have to repeat this 'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary.     Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to    protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing    Palestinean human rights.  I'm sorry, but the above sentence does not make sense. Please rephrase it.      |> If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then     |> tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?      Because not all states are like Israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant.  Oh, ok. So how about the human rights of the Syrians, Iraqis and others? Does the name of Hama sound familiar? Or how about the kurds in Iraq and Turkey?  How about the Same in Sweden (Ok, maybe a bit farfetched..) the Russians in the Baltic states or the Moslem in the old USSR and Yugoslavia?

So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights.    (i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph).  No, I'm agreeing that to just kick all the Palestinians out of Israel proper  would probably lead to disaster for both parties. If that's what you refer  to as the 'Israeli solution' then so be it.     |>    Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization)     |>    said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:    |>     ""Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both    |>     peoples together in this country....

What do you _do_ for a living?      Above you wrote that you understood what i meant (underlined by ^ ):     any system can be used to solve the conflict , but not any system would     resolve it JUSTLY.  An unjust solution would be a non-solution, per definition, no? You said the following:  For all A it holds that A have property B. There exists an A such that property B does not hold.  Thus, either or both statements must be false.     |> Guess where that takes your logic? To never-never land.    I was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning. Since you claim to be logical I felt it best to point this out before you started using your statements to prove a point or so. Am I then to assume you are  not logical?    Any quote can be misused, especially when used to stereotype all  individuals by a statement of an individual. If you use the same methods that you credit 'Zionists' with, then where does that place you?  Oh, by the way, I'd advice you not to assume anything about my 'loyalties'. I will and am condemning acts I find vile and inhuman, but I'll try as  long as I can not to assume those acts are by a whole people. By zionist above do you mean the state of Israel, the government of Israel,  the leaders of Israel (political and/or religious) or the jews in general? If you feel the need to condemn, condemn those responsible instead. How would you feel if we started condemning you personally based on the bombings in Egypt?   -- "	1

One has to read Mr. Salah's posters, in which he decribes Jews as ""sons of pigs and monkeys"", keeps promising the ""final battle"" between Muslims and Jews (in which the stons and the trees will ""cry for the Muslims to come and kill the Jews hiding behind them""), makes jokes about Jews dying from heart attacks etc, to realize his objective stance on the matters involved."	1
 An open letter to Marc Afifi   Dear Marc,  I believe that you are wrong about Mr. Freeman.  He has written in a style that raises the level of posts on this board.  If you just don't seem to get it, I believe that it is more of a reflection of you and your abilities than of him.  His posts contain substance and and he defends his positions  well.  Having said this, I would like to ask in general for people on this  board to realize that if they don't agree with the substance of posts, then they should respond to the substance (or lack of) of the posts rather than attack the author of the posts.  When one has to resort to attacking a poster rather than what he/she has written, one can see that that person does not have the ability to make a coherent argument concerning the post.  Peace, 	1

Andy Beyer has claimed that the Israeli Press is a bit biased. But the fact is that there are events shaping the politics of the mideast that people who do not read the Israeli press simply know nothing about.  Many of these events are not even mentioned here. I read the Israeli press to learn of important events about which you know nothing, because of your total reliance on western media for your information on Israel.  Since I read both American media and Israeli media, I can say with absolute certainty that anybody who reliesx exclusively on the American press for knowledge about Israel does not have a true picture of what is going on.	1
"04/16/93 1045  ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES  By David Ljunggren  MOSCOW, April 16, Reuter - Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weapons x and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted it might try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in Yerevan said.  Separately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest offensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in the Transcaucasian region soaring.  The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of the Armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending  planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.  It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about the impermissibility of such actions,"" the journalists quoted Duliyan as  saying.  ""If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate measures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft units.""  Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the conflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.  The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.  A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.  Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.  ""All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the country which is affording military assistance over our airspace,"" he said.  Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops  involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.  Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.  ""The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's) leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,"" the agency said.  Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of Commonwealth leaders.  ""The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the protection of the Karabakh population,"" Tass quoted him as saying.       At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have collapsed.  ""The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh,"" he said. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not  been recognised by any other country.  Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future peace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.  Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender Gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with Armenia, had resigned.  Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office. Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of Baku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev. There was no official confirmation.  "	1
"  Is that what turns you on? The truth needs to be told over and over  again. There are Armenians who of course witnessed the Armenian genocide  of 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914-1920 but their voices of truth  are suppressed today in the hollow din of anti-Turkish/Muslim campaign by the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle of the fascist  x-Soviet Armenian Government.

It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of  the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60 thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place. This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule, is said in the document.     Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan, and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.    It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine, food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the  sick and the wounded men.--O--   60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES        BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajar region, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from the Armenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar. According to press -service of Azerbaijan president, no one survived the tragedy. --O--   SITUATION IN THE REGION OF KELBAJAR     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attempts to evacuate the rest of 15,000 citizens, encircled on alpine villages of the region of Kelbajar  went on within the last twenty-four hours. Evacuation helicopters could not land near these villages because of shelling from the Armenian side and existence of fog. Measures are undertaken to air-drop food and medicine to the encircled people.    Several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours to get out of the region of Kelbajar via mountain range. Refugees are  settled in the neighboring regions of Azerbaijan and in Ganja.  Authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical  aid and food. The number of refugees from Kelbajar is over 40,000 people. Azerbaijan is not capable of handling a disaster of this magnitude.--0--   ARMENIAN ARMY CONTINUES ATTACK ON FIZULI     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: The region of Fizuli of Azerbaijan,  situated outside of the territory of Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag, has been subjected to heaviest attacks of Armenian army for the fourth day. About 30 armored technique and more than 500 soldiers of the enemy are taking part in the attack.    Armenian units broke the defence line of the azeri forces and occupied the ruling height from where the town is shelled from ""Grad"" installations, this morning. There is heavy destructions in the town and more than 20 people are dead. Population of the town is hastily evacuated.--0--   PRESS-CONFERENCE OF THE CHIEF OF PRESS-SERVICE OF PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Fifty-five thousand refugees from the region of Kelbajar were taken out by 11 o'clock on April 5, informed the chief of the press-service of president of Azerbaijan, Arif Aliev, today.    Journalists were also informed at the press-conference that International Red Cross is helping to accept and render refugees medical aid. There is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents, food and medical aid.    Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy brought on by the latest aggression of Armenia, the leadership of Azerbaijan intends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human life all over the world for help.    Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression  of Armenia, Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressed its anxiety to leadership of Armenia.    Participants of peace efforts in Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag under CSCE, Rafaelli, Mareska and Chetin strongly blamed the aggression of  Armenia against Azerbaijan.    Leader of press-service informed that tomorrow ambassador of  Azerbaijan in Russia, Hikmet Haji-zade, will conduct a press-conference in Moscow. Detailed information on latest events in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan will be given at the press-conference.--0--   AZERBAIJANIS PICKET IN FRONT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Azerbaijanis, living in Moscow, picketed in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. Picket was conducted as a token of protest against participation of Russian units in capture of the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan by Armenians. About 100 people took part in the picket, organized by Azerbaijani society ""Dayag"".--0--   PICKET OF SADVALERS IN MOSCOW     BAKU (5 APRIL) 30-40 members of ""Sadval"" society picketed before the building of permanent representation of Azerbaijan in Moscow. Picketers were demanding the return of Lezghins lands, as if annexed by Azerbaijan.    Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classified this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic conflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turan correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the Armenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti- azerbaijani action of the ""Sadval"" society in Moscow. He also marked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality in the whole.    Society of Lezghins, ""Sadval"", registered in Moscow in 1990, demands the creation of a Lezghistan state, which never existed before on the northern territories of Azerbaijan.--0--   ATTACK OF ARMENIAN UNITS STOPPED     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attack of Armenian army on the town of  Fizuli, which began in the last twenty-four hours, is stopped, informs  the press-service of the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan.    In the result of undertaken measures, 6 tanks and a number of  the attackers were destroyed. Advance units of the Armenian army retreated several kilometers.    Chairman of the parliament, Isa Gambar, visited the town of  Fizuli and met with commanders of the units of the national army and local citizens, today.--0--   STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan  issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan.    It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .   Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in the territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.    Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper) Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of  Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked in the document.    It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.    It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia  have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.    The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions against the aggressor.--0--   Serdar Argic"	1

I donot know about you, but it makes full sense to me. Israelis are being killed because Israel is occupying , Let israel withdraw and israeli blood will be saved. It isNOT the palestineans who undermined the right of life of israelis, but it is israel which occupied and exposed  the life of its citizens to the the unconcluded war of 1967 !  More generally, the violence in the occupied terretories is part of the intifada, and i had previously posted a ""long"" article about this issue, whom i finished by an open question: Suppose the Intifada stops, What is the motive for Israel to withdraw ? donot tell hope for peace and this bullshit. Everybody in the world looks and hopes for peace, so why isnot there any. hope of peace is necessary but not sufficient motive.    As for the Arabian countries, their problems are an Arabian concern.  the Arabian people can deal with it themselves, if the west doesnot intervene. As for Serbs, I donot think that those FUCKED UP RAPISTS (excuse my language but it really hurts as much if I was in Bosnia itself) areNOT humans. Those surely came from outer space or something. No human can allow himself to see such attrocities than to participate in.    Ok.   My definition is the same as yours, but one has to look into the world politics. In politics, a ""solution"" doesNOT imply ""JUST solution"".   It seems that it was problem in the definition of ""solution"". I think a solution must be just, because otherwise it would never be lasting. However, when politicians say a solution, they donot mean a just solution but  just a solution.  "	1
   What the hell do you know about Israeli policy?  What gives you the fiat to look into the minds of Israeli generals?  Has this 'policy of intimidation' been published somewhere?  For your information, the actions taken by Arabs, specifically the PLO, were not uncommon in the Lebanon Campaign of 1982.  My brain is full of shit?  At least I don't look into the minds of others and  make Israeli policy for them!   Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We all suffer.  It's too bad that civilians get killed but I will blame their Arab leaders who put them in positions of danger before I will blame the Israelis.  Just like Palestinians who send their children into warzones to throw rocks at armed Israeli soldiers.  What irresponsible parents! As Golda Meir said, peace will only come when the Arabs start loving their children more than they hate the Jews.	1

 I'm not aware that the US government considers me dangerous.  In any case, that has nothing to do with the current case.  The claim against the ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their standard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer to things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and license information, photographs, etc.   You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them. At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.  As my previous posting shows, California law entitles people to compensation even in the absence of any specific consequences -- just for the further dissemination of certain types of private information about them.	1
    Syria had been bombing Israeli settlements from the Golan and sending terrorist squads into Israel for years.  Do you need me to provide specifics? I can.  Why don't you give it up, Hasan?  I'm really starting to get tired of your  empty lies.  You can defend your position and ideology with documented facts and arguments rather than the crap you regularly post.  Take an example from someone like Brendan McKay, with whom I don't agree, but who uses logic and documentation to argue his position.  Why must you insist on constantly spouting baseless lies?  You may piss some people off, but that's about it.  You won't prove anything or add anything worthy to a discussion.  Your arguments just  prove what a poor debater you are and how weak your case really is.	1
The above headline is much better than the original one. read on..   So far so good...   Old friend, whatever....   That is a great attitude for someone who wants to pressure the Serbs to accept a peace plan that gives them most of the territory they got by force and terror.   this is a good thing to hear. Anybody wondering why Serbia is not really under any boycott? Anybody remembers the Gulf war? Did Saddam kill 100,000 people and rape 50,000 women?    Still in the threatening stage.. Maybe when there is no more Bosnians, the UN will lift the arms Embargo on them! Military intervention? that is reserved for Muslim countries.

  If you consider Israeli reporting of events in Israel to be propoganda, then  consider the Washington Post's handling of American events to be propoganda too.  What makes the Israeli press inherently biased in your opinion?  I wouldn't compare it to Nazi propoganda either.  Unless you want to provide some evidence of Israeli inaccuracies or parallels to Nazism, I suggest you  keep your mouth shut.  I'm sick and tired of all you anti-semites comparing Israel to the Nazis (and yes, in my opinion, if you compare Israel to the Nazis you are an anti-semite because you know damn well it isn't true and you are just trying to discredit Israel).	1

Furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped  with a deep sense of commitment, politically mature and conscious, who  determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through all necessary means,  ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle.

Had Israeli methods been anything like this, then Iraq wouldn've been nuked long ago, entire Arab towns deported and executions performed by the tens of thousands.  The fact is, though, that Israeli methods aren't even 1/10,000th as evil as those which are common and everyday in Arab states.   ""Israeli soil""????  Brad/Ali!

Only TV could transmit the full sadness of his face. ""You say that we teach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happen to a child who sees this ?"" And once again he wraps himself in a lengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood in the field of rubble that was once his home. The term 'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. Nothing is left of what he accumulated during his entire life, only the rubble of a house and shreds of belongings.  Once again Khan Yunis. Once again demolished homes. Last Thursday there was a search for wanted people here. Once again the IDF forces employed the new method, fired and bombed and shot missiles and placed explosives. Already three times during the past weeks I have gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more horrifying scenes. This time they hit the largest number of houses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completely demolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more brutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, the residents were still told to remove their valuables from their homes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the handcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied with some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to stand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were even allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just gold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus, last Thursday, some 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behind their backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pants on their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their hearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their homes, one after the other.

   >>I'm surprised that you don't consider the acquisition of land by    >>the Jews from arabs, for the purpose of establishing an exclusive    >>state, as a hostile action leading to war.   Could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of  Israel right after it was formed.     No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity. Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about anti-trust in the business world.  Since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says that, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of investing, you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly, the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate. They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.  The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic / multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours was no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair market value, etc... They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist myself, but this one is hard to dismiss).     Again Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its OK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is a nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it has an integer square root.    Do you actually believe this? My experience tells me that every palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in Palestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with you. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care, just being rethorical.     Don't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews). Israel probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic cleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the international community, or make the best out of a no win condition: show the world how good Israel is towards the 'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the arab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So yes, they're there. But as a community with history and roots, its dead.       I stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not predominant in Palestine in recent history. I have no problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were predominantly Jewish. So there. what to make of the rest Palestine?    --  Sam Zbib                                         Bell-Northern Research ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Bitnet/Internet: zbib@bnr.ca                    VOICE:  (613) 763-5889                                                 FAX:    (613) 763-2626 Surface Mail: Stop 162, P.O.Box 3511, Station C, Ottawa, Canada, K1Y 4H7	1

the 'Center for Policy Research' writes...        Considering all the murders of innocent Israelis at the hands      of Arab death merchants, I see nothing wrong with the advice.       As usual, the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research' echoes     through this newsgroup.  Here we have an enraged Likudnik who     is venting his spleen, and you portray it as if this is going     to become policy.  You don't say what the response to Matza's     suggestion was.  Do do not mention whether he was refering to     terrorists caught in the act, which could be a clear cut case     of self-defence.  Would you care to elaborate on this, or was     this all you wanted to say on the matter.  Why don't you give     up this 'Center for Policy Research' crap, and just post your       biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name?       A laudable precaution.            Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray     Israel as negatively as you can.  Deliberate omissions are an     integral part of the shtick.  And it's not only the incidents     that you do not mention, but even the stories you do post are     fraught with omissions, which change the entire meaning.  The     absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias.      In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light, you      have accomplished nothing, except to prove that a respectable      sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing      but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude      against Israel and the need to vent it.

"   You mean he talks about those Jews, who, because of their self hatred, spend all their time attacking Judaism, Jews, and Israel, using the most despicable of anti-Semetic stereotypes?   I don't think we need to coin a term like ""Jedeo-Nazism"" to refer to those Jews who, in their endless desire to be accepted by the Nazis, do their dirty work for them.  We can just call them house Jews, fools, or anti-Semites from Jewish families.   I think ""house Jews,"" a reference to a person of Jewish ancestry who issues statements for a company or organization that condemn Judaism is perfectly sufficeint.  I think a few years free of their anti-Semetic role models would do wonders for most of them.  Adam  Adam Shostack            adam@das.harvard.edu"	1

"Elias' initial statement certain *is* hot air. But it seems to be almost standard procedure around here to first throw out an absurb, overstated image in order to add extra ""meaning"" to the posting's *real point*.

  ...  Of course you never read Arab media,  I read Arab, ISRAELI (Jer. Post, and this network is more than enough) and Western (American, French, and British) reports and I can say that if we give Israel -10 and Arabs +10 on the bias scale (of course you can switch the polarities) Israeli newspapers will get either a -9 or -10, American leading  newspapers and TV news range from -6 to -10 (yes there are some that are more Israelis than Israelis) The Montreal suburban (a local free newspaper) probably is closer to Kahane's views than some Israeli right wing newspapers, British range from 0 (neutral) to -10, French (that Iknow of, of course) range from +2 (Afro-french magazines) to -10, Arab official media range from 0 to -5 (Egyptian)  to +9 in SA. Why no +10? Because they do not want to overdo it and stir people against Israel and therefore against them since  they are doing nothing.     the average bias of what you read would be probably around -9, while that of the average American would be the same if they do not read or read the new-york times and similar News-makers, and -8 if they read some other RELATIVELY less biased newspapers.	1
What else do you expect?  Israel is trying to portray itself as the great democracy.  One requirement is to have a leader who previously had an extra-marital affair (e.g. Bill Clinton) It helps if your wife says it's OK.	1
"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: From Israeli press. Madness.  /* Written  4:34 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- ""From Israeli press. Madness."" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.  Paper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Aviv's time). Friday local Tel Aviv's paper, affiliated with Maariv.  Date: 19 February 1993  Journalist: Guy Ehrlich  Subject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan (Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate within the occupied territories.  Excerpts from the article:  ""A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as Arabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is that everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one way or another insane"".  A man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name is known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to depart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service. But in their souls, one can notice something completely different....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them. And they think that to most of their fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after they began to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking. The following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness.  (...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We called such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common phenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On Fridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to until I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that I can go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don't want them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it instantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only there I become normal.(...)  (...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother. It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began to laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov cocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as they deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with the effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I was delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the Arab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit him straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off something.  Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab, blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All right, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt I was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over her head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know what to say.  (...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a field. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend shot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it. We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two deer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We had hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too, so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like beasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We were almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we felt the whole day very badly.  (...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in. This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may be for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel Godlike of sorts.""  (...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. 'Why shouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ? Why shouldn't I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver while being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits me perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a reasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to Bosnia in order to fight there."""	1
"Well,I tried not to get involved in this never ending talk,but,man,I REALLY got hot about this bullshit.   Making stupid and idiot jokes about soliders will not bring anything (not mentioning peace or agreement). I also know several tens of jokes about arabs (palestinians) but I DO NOT post them to Usenet (Anyway,not to THIS newsgroup), since I don't think I will achieve any target but making other parts furious,and this is NOT my target. If this is your target...well...that tells a lot about you.    Did you really think he is talking about something realistic?   Yeah,well,sometimes,when cowards put their children and wives in the front line, so their enemy cannot do anything,well,maybe in those cases,you have no better thing to do (to save your life) than shooting. And if parents want their children alive,I think it would be better that before they get out to throw stones/molotov botlles,or when they come to kill soliders,to keep their children in the houses.                ^^^^^^^^^^^^----\/                          Look in the dictionary at the word ""terrorism""! It     esp for political purposes.     It sounds more like your guys...   Yeah? Well,I guess you were in there,and you know it all...                               ^^^^^^^^^^---\/                            Where from do you know that it was ""on purpose""?       Personally,I didn't hear about this case,although       I don't deny it.But how can ANYBODY,besides the       person itself,can say it was ""on purpose""?   Yeah,sure.The truck driver looked in the car with his Zionist Equipment of Detecting Palestinian Children,and then he thought to himself:Hey there is a 5 year  and 2 weeks girls in the car.Why won't I make an accident and kill the ""enemy""? Maximum I will die too in the crash...But what do I care?...   Well,It was about 3 years ago ,in the Intifada (The fact that  you can't remember the time prooves how much do you care about it). I DO NOT think that what the soliders did was correct. But I will not agree that they ""were breaking their arms"".I saw that film,and,unlike in the USA,it was broadcasted entirely not long ago (in a talk show) and at the end the ""arm-broken"" guys got up and walked and used their arms very good. They guy who did it was interviewed and he said he did it because the terrorist or whatever he was refused to take his orders,and spitted in his face. What ammount of truth exist in this statement I cannot tell you,because I wasn't there. But the guy who did it was in prison,if it makes you any good.   No,it didn't. The Israeli army is still the most important army in the midlle east.It is still the only human army(as much as an ARMY can be human).To any American who will claim the opposite,I can only remember the CNN broadcasting of the American Solider who beat a Somalian boy. It was very cruel to see.But I won't say because of this that the American army is cruel.   Some kind of proof! ""Obvious""? Where from? If you say it is behind the scenes, how do you know about it?    I just wanted to show how much garbadge one can say,without knowing ANYTHING about what he says,and living a life far away from the place he talks about."	1

"   It is called 'The Justice'. We also demand that the x-Soviet Armenian  Government admit its responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish  Genocide, render reparations to the Muslim people, and return the  land to its rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has  become an issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative  that artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.   Are you the 'truelove' or 'falselove' of 'Arromdian' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle?   ""If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the nations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have opposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so.  They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody ""to worship in their own way"" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus, in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when  people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and  where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian countries.""[1]  ""The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came under their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of Russian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a Romanian nation today"" (Popescu Ciocanel).  ""Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without interfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced European countries.""[2]  ""...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw is older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into action, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves happy!"" (A. de Mortraye).[3]  ""Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years, and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey, however, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities, local courts immediately take them under their protection.""  ""In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are living together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition  to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this  sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the dead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of  priests.""

And the rest of the world is getting used to Arab tactics of claiming innocence for even the most guilty of the vile murderers among them. Keep it up long enough and it will backfire but good. "	1
 Henrik (?),  Your ignorance manifests itself in an awkward form of intransigence. I'm not going to spend time to review with you the recent history of Cyprus. If you are really interested, I can provide you with a number of references on the issue. Just send me EMail for that.   Relax! You're swinging fists into open air... I was *agreeing* with you, assuming that would be one of your points that you did not state! You may  not be very much used to it, to be agreed with - that is, but take it more easily.  !:-)      No, Henrik, believe me: You don't hope that.

In my postings I have made a proposal for comments and discussion. Those who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to do so.  However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner, legally responsible for their deeds. I cannot accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threats.  PS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that justice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967 are not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called pragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can never be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace. It is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the law, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not normal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than Western democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society, in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any more. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their traditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that most American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.  I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect Judaism are uncivilized. Such behaviour is not good for Judaism.	1

We ran into one of my relatives at the  bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away, near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a fellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, ""What are you standing here for? Go home immediately!"" I asked, ""What's going on?"" He says,  ""What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're  killing Armenians!"" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.  We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our  courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were  about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They were shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice  or two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35. They went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and  throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one  has a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a  guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.  We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School  No. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families  there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only  known Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani  guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was  nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We  were told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our  microdistrict.  We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.  On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be used to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of  them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I asked him for assistance. I say, ""We're in School No. 33, we need to be  evacuated."" Well he says, ""Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now.""  I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with him personally. When I called he said, ""Muslimzade here.""  About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, ""Armenians, come  out, we're here to get you."" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in  their hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, ""Where should I go?"" I  say, ""If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that  the Armenians were here and that they left."" That's what he did. He went down  there and said, ""The Armenians were here,"" he said, ""I let them out the back  door, they went that way."" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and  noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.  So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right! Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that Muslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that  we were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the  morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.  In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers  took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there  were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy,  about three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor,  nothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was just very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything they could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his  mother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...  I searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third floor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping,  with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of  them.  There were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten,  everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City Party Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage  was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being sold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to  get the things any cheaper.  I met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in his eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we  worked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw  me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his  feelings, of course.

"  Let us not forget about the genocide of the Azeri people in 'Karabag'  and x-Soviet Armenia by the Armenians. Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians  committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of  despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned  them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound  hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated  personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most  unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history.                                  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  ""I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,"" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. ""I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.""  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  ""At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,"" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  ""None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,"" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  ""I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. ""We have never got any of the bodies back.""  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  ""The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,"" Mr Sadikov said. ""I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.""  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: From Israeli press. TORTURE.  /* Written  4:41 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- ""From Israeli press. TORTURE."" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.  Newspaper: Ma'ariv Date: 18. December 1992 Author: Avi Raz  Subject: Torture  Title of article: Moderate physical pressure  Several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation room in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated, beaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a Shabak agent 'Captain Louis', chatting on the phone with his wife. ""At those moments"", Omar said, ""I felt that he was like a humanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat me and say, 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed yourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being"".  In late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm prison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. ""Among the Jews, as among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people"", he said after his release, ""but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations rooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that he is a human being"". Although he left the detention installation in Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (""I sat at home for ten days. My hands shook from nerves""), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He got out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned to normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.  In contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released seven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the Shabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn't speak or react. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early August and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left it one day later - dead. ""We have recently received an especially large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at the Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators"", noted Dr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)  The right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan Saber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated in Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.  (...follow description of tortures....)  Omar, a tall bearded man, was silent. ""I do not want to talk about it"", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and ashamed, he spoke: ""Sometimes he beats you and beats you until you'll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of another interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room, later if I want, you will kiss my ass.""  These things take place in an Israeli army detention installation, located within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West Bank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In early March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to visit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation wing. ""The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely under Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by it"", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an, the commander of the installation, according to the internal report written by B'tselem member, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe'er, governing commander of the prison system in the Central Command, was quoted in the report:  ""There is an ethical problem here - no one can enter the interrogation wing""."	1

"    Are you related to 'Arromdian' of ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle?   Ditto.   HELSINKI WATCH: ""PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE""  Ankara (A.A)  In a 15-page report  of the ""Helsinki Watch""  it is stated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being implemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end.  The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government should grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of minorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and in addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the ""Turkish Minority"" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify themselves as 'Turks'.  NEWSPOT, May 1992   GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS  The  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek state is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish minority with Turkey.  Pointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is called ""Greek""  by ethnic  definition, only  the religion  of the minority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview with Turkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western Trace are also Turkish.""  Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in Western  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement signed in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.  Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr. SadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority, Faikoglu said.  ""In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented Greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal rights.""  On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by cooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was will to improve relations with Greece.  NEWSPOT, January 1993   MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.  Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.    Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine.    Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly magazine  ""ENA""  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek general election.    Bulev said in the interview: ""I am not Greek, I am Macedonian."" Sideropoulos said  in the  article that ""Greece  should recognise Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC are falling.""    The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court summons,  was   that  ""they  have   spread...intentionally  false information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the international interests of the country (Greece).""    The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.    In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000 in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.    Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live.    Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent, especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.    Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections are over.  Serdar Argic"	1

 The investment was there in the form of huge tax breaks, and employer benfits.  You are overlooking the difference that these could have made to any company.  Part of the problem was that few industries were interested in political settling, as much as profit.

"The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993 issue of USA Today (""Drug Use Up At Younger Age"" by Mike Snider, p. 1A).      Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders -     usually 13 - and they're using more LSD and inhalants like glue     and air fresheners, says a new survey.      The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds     ""statistically significant increases"" in eighth-graders' use of     many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, LSD and inhalants.      ""We may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing     drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters     adolescence,"" says Lloyd Johnston, University of Michigan, chief     researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and     Human Services.      But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long     decline.      The study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the     following in the 30 days before they were polled:          * 8th-graders  - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%;                          cocaine 0.7%.          * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%;                          cocaine 0.7%.          * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%;                          cocaine 1.3%.      Among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants     declined over the year before.  Not so with LSD.      * 2% of eighth-graders have tried LSD in the last year, up 24%     over 1991.       * Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6%     tried it in the last year.      Reducing drug use among students ""requires a different kind of     strategy"" that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part     of an overall illness prevention plan.      The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders     disapprove of them.      ""It's scary,"" Shalala says.  ""Dealers are focusing on younger, more     vulnerable kids.""

  Well yes and no. The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position.   The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question. The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914 and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.     The system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up a bit too slow.    The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being a check on unreasonable legislation. The veto was clearly regarded  as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.	1
           Well, I don't think your query was exactly polite, but I will TRY to give you a polite responce.  Something atypical of the net, but here it goes.         Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From many of the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports I have seen, this adjective       is commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say that Mr. King was a no good black!  I do not know Mr. King and would not make this ascertian without some evidence to this effect.  I used it PURELY as a  descriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people have used it in the past.         The entire second trial was about race, Ted.  I don't feel compelled to discuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would not have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating would not have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call to make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.          I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive than me using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner.  Would you have been happier if I had used 'African-american' ?  If so, then you really are lost in the world of PC.  You have already been instrumental in getting one persons net access revoked, and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my  message to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting.	1

" I'm afraid that I've lost the thread here.  I didn't suggest that all  government regulations be subject to referenda.  So I don't follow the  comments above.   I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.  Furthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an industrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it would produce would effectively crush productive effort.  No, I'm not surprised.  I just think it's interesting that on one hand libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realize that many libertarians assume that such a government will be  counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the establishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.)  Yup, sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirement that the government provide for the general welfare (Article I section 8), I'm willing to justify such programs on that basis.  Well, in the first place, I don't support a ""socialized economic system."" I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is not the case that ""any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.""  There are multitudes of examples where such a statement is demonstrably false.  Regulation of stock market transactions that provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one example.  jsh "	1

"       Two institutions with absolute power.  Cute.        Let's talk practicality, shall we?  If the Monarch tried to do something, what would happen?            But you illustrated the problem very well.          I am contending that there is no state in the Union which does not have ample wealth, if they choose to spend it, to run a perfectly acceptable Education system.  (I further contend that the amount of money being spent now is more then sufficient, but is being spent badly.)          So, tell me Phill.  Were the Republicans also responsible for some of the *huge* increases in social programs?  Or were they *only*  responsible for what you don't like.  (I contend it is Congress which is to blame.  Democrat and Republican alike.)          Most of our worst areas are still better off than most of Europe. In any case, we're talking about *education*.            Yes, I live in once such area.  You're woefully ignorant of the situation.         At the same time some of Tennessee's school districts are closing down, the Governor asked for 7.5 million dollars for bicentenntial celebration license plats.  In almost the same breath he wanted to raise unemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it.          I don't know about the rest of the country, but *our* education problems stem directly from two problems, neither of which are a lack of money in the state.  (BTW, Tennessee is considered a ""tax heaven"" and our economy is one of the strongest in the country.  *I* see a correlation.)  1)  What money we spend goes primarly to administration. The average administrator makes two and a half times what the average teacher makes, and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue.  And 2) the Governor is making a concerted effort to create an ""Education crisis"" in order to push for his pet income tax.  Some of the most idiotic programs get funded (like State funds for new art in the county seat) while schools are closing.  It's not a lack of funds.  It's an unwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate.  Education is *the* parental hot-button.  Education is *always* the first to but cut, because it's easier to get people to pay for their children than ugly art.         It spoke very eloquently on government being based on the consent of the governed.           They did it anyway.  The Continental Congress had its own set of bylaws.  It wasn't quite a government, but a means of making decisions had to be created.  (However low George Washington's opinion of them were.)         Allow me again to speak heresy against the Holy Democratic Orders. So what?  The government was built with a very non-democratic Presidency with fairly broad powers, including the veto.         Yes, and the Senate was intended to act as a balance to this. Too much democracy was intentionally avoided.  It was considered a good thing to place non-democratic blocks to impulsive action.         So long as Congress has something to sell, people will pay for it.  Most congressmen rake in more money than they need.          No, if the ""progressives"" don't want the ""reactionaries"" to move backward, they get the same benefit.  41% of the states is a *lot* of people.  And historically laws with that sort of minority arent' very effective, especially since it is usually geographically concentrated.        When wielding the Federal Big Stick I don't see why they shouldn't have to make a better argument than, ""more people than not,"" agree.                 I'm not a Republican.  I'm a republican.  :-)                And no, I'm neither a Democrat nor a democrat.                Now, I've asked several times, and all you've done is answer ""It isn't democratic,"" which I knew before I said it.  Why *should* it be democratic?  We don't have a true direct democracy, and few people advocate one.  Why, then, is this other modification of democracy to bias it against action so much worse? "	1

What I found interesting about Conklin's letter is the  6 cases he has won against the IRS.  Now, assuming that these cases really exist and were one by him (anyone checked?) they may have nothing to do with his major tax claim.  The IRS fought one of his deductions.   Defending your deductions seems puny when you believe that there is no need to file in the first place! 	1

 How can a witness tell that someone in a burning truck is dead rather than unconscious?   What kind of witnesses?  If we are talking about witnesses who were at the accident, or were otherwise directly involved (e.g., paramedics, emergency room doctors, etc.), then they should have been used at the first trial.  You don't get a new trial because you screwed up and forgot to call all of your witnesses.  If we are talking about new expert witnesses who will offer new interpretations of the data, note that the loser can *ALWAYS* find such witnesses.  If this were grounds for a new trial, then the loser could *ALWAYS* get a new trial, and keep doing so until the loser becomes a winner (and then the other side would come up with new expert witnesses).	1

 I totally agree.  Really, the only people this is going to benefit, are those who live in the cities where the train stops.  Who wants to drive to the train station from X (Lubbock for example)?  It's probably farther to drive to the train station than it is to the nearest national airport.	1
" Insofar as several ""liberal"" jurisdictions are concerned, the essential elements of rape are gender neutral. Nonetheless, I decided to provide a number of references to support my original argument. Black's Law Dictionary (every law student/lawyer's friend) defines rape as: Unlawful sexual intercourse with a female without her consent. The unlawful knowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will. The Model Penal Code (the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures) defines rape as: A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if he (a) compels her to submit by force or by threat of imminent death.... (MPC @213.1(1)(a))  Indeed the following jurisdictions/states have statutes similar to the MPC:  Alabama-- Code of Ala. @13A-6-61 (1992) Arkansas--Ark.Stat.Ann. @5-14-103 (1993) District of Columbia--D.C.

"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Then why do we really need national health insurance then? Wouldn't it just make more sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance?  And maybe that's not such a good thing. I also read somewhere that it is next to impossible in Canada to litigate against the health system-class action suits are nearly impossible, and you can't sue the provincial health officials at all.   Oh no. Don't let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it is. Ask most Americans whether they'd like the doctors' lobby to get more powerful.   Well, yeah, tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside Ottawa. Theoretically it's limited to service personnel, but some studies I've heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but aren't ""urgent"" at all.  The problem is, in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are approved by the government, how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions? I bet that if you're an MP or MPP, or good friends with one, you're put on any hospital's ""urgent"" care list no matter how minor your problem. Which is OK  unless you're someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.   Hmm. How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of GNP spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting?  Maybe Canada spends proportionately just as much on health care as we do.   So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse. Bob Rae, the second least popular man in Ontario, warned Ontarians a few years ago that if they didn't stop cross-border shopping in such huge numbers, ""the services they expect from the province just won't be there in a few years"" (Fortunately for them (and less fortunately for the retailers here in Western New York) the  Canadian dollar went back to a more realistic value). He didn't say so, but I knew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the  truth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no  obligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what you say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling  such basic services, too).   Would that it were free. Americans would start another revolution if they had to pay taxes at Canadian rates. "	1

The Selective Service Registration should be abolished.  To start with, the draft is immoral.  Whether you agree with that or not, we don't have one now, and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior with a volunteer army than with draftees.  Finally, the government has us on many lists in many computers (the IRS, Social Security Admistration and Motor Vehicle Registries to name a few) and it can find us if it needs to. Maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time. Let's axe this whole department, and reduce the deficit a little bit. 	1

      Unfortunately, there's not much we can learn from the statistics presented here either.  Due to rounding, the 1991 est. for LSD could be anywhere from .550 to .649 and the 1992 est. could be anywhere from .850 to .949. This means that the actual change (if you believe these statistics in the first place) was anywhere from 31% to 73%.  Similarly the increase in cocaine use could be anywhere from 18% to 66% and the increase of crack use could be anywhere from 29% to 120%.  This doesn't even take into account the margin of error which isn't provided here.	1
THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary _________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                             April 14, 1993                                     REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT                       AT SUMMER JOBS CONFERENCE                                        Hyatt Regency                         Crystal City, Virginia     11:22 A.M. EDT               THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that  Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today  about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to  get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature  of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of  people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of  those who are here.                I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education  and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my  good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and  all of the business and local community leaders from the city and  county and state level from around America who are here.               This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved  hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is  their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A  year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because  I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our  country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had  too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines  of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to  take us into the future.                I entered with the hope that together we could create  more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of  our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of  America's community, knowing that together we could always to more  than we could individually and that we might secure our future.              All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000  jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the  commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here,  and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs  does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this  stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all  those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're  on the right track.              Last July when I was traveling across America's  heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in  Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business  people who were participating in the Louisville Education and  Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.   I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed  both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my  own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about  -- that for millions of American young people it is really an  impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good  workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what  is learning.              In the world in which we are living, the average young  person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a  lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning  world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young  people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased  here today.                Whether you're in business or in government or in  education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to  building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all  of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things  are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best  thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have  jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)                They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty  good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that  they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either  political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great  challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to  fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work  for them to do.              All the European countries have higher unemployment  rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the  unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.   They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its  most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that  I have proposed to create jobs.               In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now  about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.   It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of  pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing  their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their  people.                But it is especially important for America for two  reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move  aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be  competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is,  even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed  of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to  work in this country.  (Applause.)              We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some  of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and  moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We  have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big  organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they  are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working  at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to  create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the  chance to work.                It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare  reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of  months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the  end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.   (Applause.)              So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of  the American people to perform without regard to race or income or  the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that  there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their  talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.   I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if  you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more  responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this  country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you  have got to have opportunity in that mix.               A part of our vision for America has to be a future for  every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules  and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be  something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are  basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners,  recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of  our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their  background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's  something there for them to do?        The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an  integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of  work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people  first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private  sector.              I said when I addressed the United States Congress in  February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000  extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the  American business community to meet that target so that we can create   more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been  created before.              Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And  Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in  this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more  than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people  a work experience.  And it is terribly important.              I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is  part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the  American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their  jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving  the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to  college but do need at least two years of post-high school training  either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting,  so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more  people to go on to college who do want to go.              All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive  plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The  emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would  create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and  that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It  would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work  force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.               It also will help a lot of cities and counties to  invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level -- projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects,  new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities  -- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve  the environment.                The summer jobs program is an important part of that  because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the  Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching  out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer  jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to  hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young  people into further educational opportunities and to further job  opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component  to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government  has never fully emphasized before.                A lot of these young people, as you well know, because  they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in  difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building  their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other  areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who  have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what  they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next  year.                What we are trying to do here is to give people the  opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning  skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next  couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school  in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning  environment.                There will be more applied academics, more opportunities  for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this  will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will  be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new  work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.              The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make- work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding  the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help  to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve  local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public  buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in  hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers,  and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while  they earn, but letting them earn.              You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people  who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should  do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the  opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing  in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't  exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare  system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people  to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the  use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if  you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to  reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.   (Applause.)              The young people we propose to put to work under our  program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math,  reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will  stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a  sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge,  but a challenge that will take them into a different life.              So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even  as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the  summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll  see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer  academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved  ahead.  I suspect that they will.                This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I  will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn  from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next  summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school  year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that  we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so  that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private  investments as well.               We want to honor the companies and the communities, the  business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this  summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business  who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who  haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about  this event today, I want to implore other private employers to  stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this  summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when  we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort  them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)              When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up  here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking  about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've  done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very  foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand  and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had  ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be  worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)              That does not mean young people should not be  entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation  ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and  worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.   And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some  people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)                I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I  grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul  without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a  job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to  people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a  job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now  I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any  more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're  working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.   And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these  young people want.              Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:   It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration  pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private  sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn  how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created  in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done  off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a  third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do  economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of  America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just  kidding.                On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy  country in the world, including the United States, is having  difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done  I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole  deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the  answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.   (Applause.)              And so the jobs program that I have presented to  Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the  counties, through the Community Development Program, with the  infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an  attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the  economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little  boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a  million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.              Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in  the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government  money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American  economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind  of system we have and it works pretty well.                But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you  here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends  and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers  to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the  funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government  should create this summer, so that together we can have this  partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a  future -- a future that our young people can believe in.                We need to send them a message that here in America if  you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute  something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.   You can build a future from you own dreams.               That has always been the promise of America.  Together  that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of  the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise  has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.              Thank you very much.  (Applause.)	1

"       The Bill of Rights, as far as I can see, does not once refer to ""citizens"", but it makes several references to ""people"". For example, Article IV: ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated""; Article V: ""no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury ...  nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law""; Article VIII: ""excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted"".  Now I've never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens; aren't they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the U.S.? Whether slaves were considered ""not human"" I don't know, but it seems that a case could be made that they weren't treated as ""people"" as defined in the Bill of Rights. And since the nation is nominally based on the Declaration of Independence which states that ""all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness"", it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition of humanity.

" Well, the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to  social and political instability, while economic inequality is much more strongly related.  In virtually all major revolutions including England (the Puritan revolution), France, Russia and China, the  revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term  growth and poverty was declining.  What sets off revolutions is massive inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom that social change is possible.  If ""poverty (were) the main engine of social instability,"" this typical historical pattern would not hold.  In fact, revolutions would have been far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time.  [Much deleted...]   Sorry, buddy, but some other ""blowhards"" managed to include the ""general welfare"" in another portion of the constitution.

I guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they said in the preamble.   But as noted above, the constitution doesn't say that, does it?   But since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense in Article I, Section 8, I guess you'll grant that botha are constitutional functions.  Right?  jsh"	1
 Canada's GST is collected as a sales tax and is considered a VAT. Funnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was never referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it, thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST ---  one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).  The stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down our deficit.  Unfortunately, their legislation didn't include any mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and the money is now sitting in escrow.  I don't know what is involved in releasing the funds, but one dilemna is that the Tories are not fiscal conservatives themselves though while taxing and spending, they've made moves to apply the breaks to a runaway locomotive by the end of this time --- the end of their second term (~9 years). While they do have chances of getting a third term, catching up in the polls to their more moderate/slightly leftish pro-business rivals, the Liberals (as in Euro/UK), the Tories' heir-apparent  for the leaders' mantle has been termed a clone of Hillary  Clinton ...  gld	1

"      [Patrick's example of anti-competitive regulations for             auto dealers deleted.]  Let me try to drag this discussion back to the original issues.  As I've noted before, I'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of  eliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers, barbers, etc.  One need not, however, swallow the entire libertarian agenda to accomplish this end.  Just because one grants the benefits of allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services without regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be  free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.   (As some/many libertarians would argue.)    On a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation is obviously worthwhile.  The libertarian agenda, however, does not call for this assessment.  It assumes that the costs of regulation (of any kind) always outweigh its benefits.  This approach avoids all sorts of  difficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic,  to say the least.  I have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education,  national defense or local police that suggests a ""free market"" can provide a more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectives than is provided through ""statist"" approaches.   With some notable exceptions, however, I do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile  analysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians.    jsh"	1
"From: New Liberation News Service <nlns> Subject: NLNS: Fascism with a Friendly Face  /* Written  8:33 pm  Apr 14, 1993 by nlns@igc.apc.org in igc:nlns.news */ /* ---------- ""NLNS Packet 3.11 *** 4-14-93"" ---------- */  Fascism with a Friendly Face: Does Rush Limbaugh Remind You of  Anyone? Daevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge  ""The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that  Hitler was original and showed initiative.""  --Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network,  October 27, 1992.  (NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of  Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to  Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was  independent and sharp as a scalpel.  My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At  least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the  idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for  delivery.  Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the  most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are  noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with  passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in  fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost  identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German  election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and  enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their  ideological quilt.  The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening  pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the  German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway  line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923)  was ""betrayed to France by a representative of his government"" when  there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.  In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as  the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost  succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic  claim in his introduction that ""in a school or during a commencement  ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional."" Of  course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of  God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is  too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.  Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books,  my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern  American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version  of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925),  and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen  million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book  after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in  Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.  Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily  three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary  propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way  Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a  translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the  printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since  radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of  luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to  spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop  $22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.  But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some  cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of  their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these  days.)  Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf  Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of  ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio  program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk  show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He  knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows  that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the  opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh  earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a  RICO indictment.  On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of  material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For  example:  On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society  Hitler: ""Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who  individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly  perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in  order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of  imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight  for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of  thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises""  (page 577).  Limbaugh: ""Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The  show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase ""with half my  brain tied behind my back to make it even""] denotes the egress of mental  aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree  with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media  will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking  and screaming all the way."" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)  On Religion as the Basis of a Nation  Hitler: ""In this world human culture and civilization are  inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his  decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without  culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord  sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the  expulsion from Paradise."" (Page 581.)  Limbaugh: ""America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ...  But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or  ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a  charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools  for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of  American education has declined ever since?"" (pages 274-5.)  On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse  Hitler: ""The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ...  One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and  theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ...  Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays  must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the  service of a moral idea of State and culture."" (pages 346 and 348.)  Limbaugh: ""Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that  Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people  who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality  and monagamy. They disparage American heroes."" (page 254.)  On the News Meida  Hitler: ""The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of  gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass  by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the  people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of  slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews."" (Page 331.)  Limbaugh: ""Elements of The Media have jumped on the  bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been  replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During  the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global  network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't  realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that  therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided  and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania."" (pages 270 and 268.)  *     *     *   To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but  ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.  After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that  haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened  Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed  Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s,  Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to  depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American  radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the  Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for  The Fascist States of America.  And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the  radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only  wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.  The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701- 0845; (608) 255-4460."	1

I dont believe the gay comunity is asking for hiring quotas like the affirmative action laws of the 60's did. My understanding is that the gay community just wants the same rights the srtraights have.  I dont think people should have their leases cancelled when their landlord finds out they are gay.  I dont think that when someone sees someone walk out of a gay business and then blabs it all over work that the gay person gets fired. Do you REALLY think these are justified ?  #4  Clayton, I am told you are a parent a couple times over. Have you been following the strip in the paper ""For Better or For Worse"" ?  I honestly want your opinion as a parent on the strip.    Do you really care about your childeren as much as friends of mine tell me ?  How much do you care about your childeren ? How much do you care about other people's childeren?  Do you care about MY childeren? Do you care about my sister's childeren ?

" Since we are talking in theory and opinion, then I'll put in my $.02.  First, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike  bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative.   On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is  because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top. If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people  for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had  conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better/worse than the whites did.  The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done (ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do  any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds, even thousands, of years ago.   My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle anything anyway.   That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear (ie. a Winner).   If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ""At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

" This is similar to my saying that Clinton's timber summit does little to fix the health care problem.  Look at the whole picture, not just randomly picked libertarian positions.

The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic which I'll address briefly.  It certainly won't happen until libertarianism is the dominate philosophy.  What means do we have to make libertarianism the dominate philosophy?  Statists run the education monopoly, so we have to be creative.

":I'm not sure why you don't consider it an option.  No one suggests that :such analysis should be left to ""regulators.""  In fact, the ""re-inventing :government"" movement provides just such a cost/benefit approach to the :analysis of public spending.  Libertarians would do well to learn more :about it.     Okay,  let me try to explain this.  When one votes for such a creature as a Senator or,  worse yet,  a President, one votes not for specific policies but for a general package which must cover all issues for 4 or 6 years.  As such,  one's influence is highly diluted. I might add that,  even if one were free to vote on individual regulations, the vast amount of time required for considering a particular regulation, combined with the very small chance of one's vote making a difference,  would make it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision with respect to specific regulations.      :Sorry, but it strikes me that it is the only ""feasible"" approach.  What is :not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and  :licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent :tasks.  I'm not sure what you mean by ""feasible"" in this case.  Do you mean that [] are impossible in priciple,  or merely that it would be undesirable in fact?   :Actually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as  :generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense.  2 of the four you saw fit to  mention,  and education of minors is always another possibility,  since minors are generally considered not to be responsible to make their own decisions as adults are.  :(It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to :be to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending :that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...)  You say this as if it were surprising,  yet in fact a necessary consequence of libertarian philosophy.  All non-coersive functions should be dealt  with privately,  therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to the state are the coersive ones.  :Perhaps you have.  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries :frequently generate support by acting as protectors of ""geezers,""  :mothers and children.  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds :that ""we don't have much to fear"" from them do so at their own peril.  Much more likely it's drunken teenagers.  The groups in questionare more  likely to be worse off during and after a revolution than before.  In the unlikely event that you missed my earlier sarcasm,  let me say this directly: The idea that such programs as Social Security or AFDC should be considered ""defense"" (an idea which has been advanced in ths and other newsgroups) is so absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration.  Do you seriously dispute this?    I don't want to seem patronizing,  but you still seem to be laboring under the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably intelligent and honest persons (like yourself) who make the decisions. I feel any third party added to a transaction is every bit as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.  I don't expect you to agree with me,  but you explain why you feel I'm wrong?

"{Sorry, Harel et al, but our doctors and most hospitals are still private in Canada as well as in much of Western Europe.}   Wrong.  In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health insurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary insurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward. With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.  That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund is to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back in Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly ""libertarian"" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).  I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100% insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American conservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who seriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the Americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that the Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite being open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a different culture.   ""Managed Care"" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western nations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France and Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says of HMO/NHS approaches, ""We left that behind with East Germany!""). Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling doctors with budget strings.  In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France and Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public hospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions are different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked ""sickness funds"" over a century old while Canada divides by their provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)  With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to the U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations in more compact geography to improve scales of economy.  gld"	1

 Isn't is funny how someone who seems to know nothing about homosexuality  uses a very flawed (IMHO) source of information to pass jusgement on all  homosexual and bisexual men.  It would seem more logical to say that since  the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity  larger as well.  In my opinion, orientation has nothing to do with it.  Men are men and they all like sex.  I am a gay male.  I have had sex three  times in my life, all with the same man.  Before that, I was a virgin.  So... whose promiscuous?  Just because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no morals.  Just because  someone is heterosexual doesn't mean they do.  Look at the world....

"         This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada's violent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S.  (Our non-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate).  It would seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun control laws.         I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural and enforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then that reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.          Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a crime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address the question of Canada.  (Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising gun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to ""magically"" keep the guns out, but now isn't.)          The other side of the coin, of course, is that far ""illegal drugs"" are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally.  I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources (stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply see South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as well, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.           And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques of it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come to mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost entirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you compared the white majority they were virutally identical.          The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs. non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative conditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of nomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into account that the non-whites in either city were not living in the same conditions.          If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns, then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are arguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far higher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly lower.           The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. ""inner-city"" problems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition which is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent crime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control is the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As one Canadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase in violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently they didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in the early eighties.          True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that crime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.         The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high or low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it was going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by saying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted to deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you can't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of that gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control was implemented, just as happened in Canada.          As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent of gun control.          Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what others did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would sell to them?"	1

Without having a complete answer to this question,  I should think it obvious that the first step should be to convince people this would be a desirable result.

"Here is a disturbing thought.  Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)  Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my pocket on two 8mm tapes.  Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that ""can't"" is a prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.  With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you need the ""master key"" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information that have to be stored an awful lot of places.  Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left unexplained by those that point out this threat.)   Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.  Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on the escrow databases.  We crypto types are all taught something very important at the beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million Clipper chips.  I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can try to delay things as long as possible.  Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe that this scheme might give people some security, even as their subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of it all.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com"	0

" That sounds like an old _Dragnet_ episode.    ""Joe and I went to the apartment of Prime Suspect.  Nobody answered the   door, but his landlord gave us permission to search the apartment.""  Perhaps that worked in California in the 60's, but as I understand the law landlords do _not_ have authority to grant permission to search space rented by a third party, provided the lease is not in default, etc. (I'm not even sure if they can provide the master key, when shown a search warrant, since the _subject_ of the search is supposed to be notified).  At this point the question becomes: did the user ""rent"" the disk space her encrypted file occupies?  If she did, it _should_ fall under the same body of case law that applies to apartments, storage lockers, etc.  (As to whether any court would recognize this fact....)  If she did not (i.e., no compensation exchanged), I don't know how it would be treated -- there doesn't seem to be a non-cyberspace equivalent. "	0
" [Prof. Denning's description of SkipJack mostly omitted]   CHIP STRUCTURE  The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption  algorithm called ""Skipjack.""  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared  with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16  for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is  16 Mbits a second. [...]   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips  N, a 30-bit serial number  U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted    with the chip  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then  fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:        E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and      E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    Three questions: 1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:   E[M;K] = 64 bits   E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits   E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits    Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,    or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?       All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications    like cellular phones (or even regular phones over   2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?    Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,    or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only    transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into    everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?  3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?    Does the block have to be present at all?    Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,    it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's     limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,    and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness    (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets    it recognize a valid E[K;U].)        In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT    wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?    (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)    Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;    paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.     On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,    presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,    like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ?

 I totally agree.  But how do you propose we take government back?  They obviously don't listen to the people or want the people to know who is responsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the Clipper chip release, to see what the entity 'clipper' was, and got a few lists. BUt when another person tried a bit later, the commands were disabled) Does not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability or information they don't control given to the people.  The secret development and implimentation of the Clipper Chip decision further backs that up.  You can bet unaurhorized encryption methods and software will be considered 'terrorist tools' and also subject to civil forfeiture, along with the systems that are running it.  YOU WATCH, SEE IF I AM WRONG.  The government is not going to be very cooperative about the people taking it back.

  We've got a tempest receiver in the lab here, and there's no difficulty in picking up individual monitors. Their engineering tolerances are slack enough that they tend to radiate on different frequencies. Even where they overlap, you can discriminate because they have different line synch frequencies - you can lock in on one and average the others out.  The signals are weird in any case, with varying polarisations and all sorts of interactions with the building. Just moving a folded dipole around is also highly effective as a (randomised) means of switching from one monitor to another,	0
"  A nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption devices with built-in trapdoors - just like the Feds wanted...   Bla-bla.   Indeed, and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the latter.   This doesn't say much. There are many incredibly weak encryption algorithms in commercial use today...   Except from the government.   Nope. The criminals won't be stupid enough to use the new chip, they'll use something secure. This technology provides only means to intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to use it.   That is, the government has the keys. It doesn't matter much if they are in one or in two of its hands...   Correct. It does, however, provide those Americans with the false sense of privacy.   If the screening is not public, it cannot be trusted. Some people do not trust DES even today, after all the examinations - only because some parts of its design were kept secret.   So they'll use a different technology to hide their illegal activities. So will those law-abiding citizens, who do not trust their government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations.   Except from the government.   Huh? Later it says that the new technology will be export restricted.   In short, the new technology can:  1) Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.  It cannot:  1) Protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse its ability to decrypt the conversations.  2) Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new encryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people who handle them, etc.  3) Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for communication.    Correct. However, it does not provide them that much privacy as it claims.    Two candidates: the NSA and the Mafia.    That is, ""trust us"".   ""Security through obscurity"".   If it's not entirely open to public examination, it cannot be trusted. Besides, who can prove that the devices used for examination and the ones built into your phones will be the same?    The NSA and the FBI?    Why did they ""forget"" the Academia?    Doesn't this smell to monopolism?    Like the Mafia?   This is the main question, why was it buried at the end?   ""We'll see"".   ""Trust us"".   In short, ""If we decide to outlaw strong crypto, we'll tell you"".   Since the US government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions and since the US constitutions guarantees the right to every American to bear arms, why is not every American entitled, as a matter of right, to an unbreakable commercial encryption product?   Bullshit. The proposed technology provides a false sense of security, encryption devices with built-in capabilities for breaking the encryption, does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto, and is a step to outlaw strong crypto.    Who was the optimist who believed that the new administration will leave the export controls on strong crypto devices?  OK, I'm not American, it's not my business, but I just couldn't resist to comment... The whole plot looks so totalitaristic... It's up to you, Americans, to fight for your rights.

"   Hmmm.  ""Check your facts.""  Good advice.  Let's check Mr. Cain's facts a bit, shall we?    FACT:  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license to do so from PKP, whether or not one is charging for it.  Furthermore, any use of RSA, other than for research purposes allowed under US patent law, is similarly unlawful.  Therefore, the ""average citizen"" cannot use RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.  There is no licensed, freely available product in the US that uses RSA encryption other than RSAREF (and hence RIPEM), at least as far as I am aware.  If you know of another, please post it here.   FACT:  The last contact I had with RSA Data Security, Inc was with some guy trying to sell me a license (unsolicited, I might add) for TIPEM. Cost: $15K plus 2-5 percent royalties.  I suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not these terms count as ""mucho bucks"" or ""incredibly reasonable.""  Either way, however, this definitely falls into the ""routines *they* tell you to (use)"".   FACT:  There are no restrictions (yet!) on the use of cryptography under US law, although this is beginning to look like it will change.  The only impediments to widespread use of RSA cryptography in the US are PKP's patents.

Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part03 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 3: Basic Cryptology  This is the third of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.    Contents:  * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key? * What references can I start with to learn cryptology? * How does one go about cryptanalysis? * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance? * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem? * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?   * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?    The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted   acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A   by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone   who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.    A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so   that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is   the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art   of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when   you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both   cryptography and cryptanalysis.    The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is   called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert   plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert   ciphertext into plaintext.    A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The   algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,   Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different   values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.    The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are   called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,   eavesdroppers, or third parties.  * What references can I start with to learn cryptology?    For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given   in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,   concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,   these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has   developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and   mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is   encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up   to the mid-60's.    Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or   Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want   to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common   mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.    The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of   many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently   several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The   book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range   of security including encryption algorithms, database security,   access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments   apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].    The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite   technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in   the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of   DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses   of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on   modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management   and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and   networks.    The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on   the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.  * How does one go about cryptanalysis?    Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of   analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern   finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available   textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series   [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for   the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given   systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the   cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still   classified.    Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,   or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare   of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the   most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.  * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?    In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can   find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.    Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding   ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the   plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or   decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.   Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this   brute-force search is impractical.        Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered   practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years   now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with   this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the   mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic   decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel   machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.   Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].    One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a   brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.  * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?    The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key   rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.    A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The   unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of   ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and   if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount   of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is   probably strong.    A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears   random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).        A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A   system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.    If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily   strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.   However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is   strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then   he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring   integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.  * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?    Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical   cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your   ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might   assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is   correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the   rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same   plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus   he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he   doesn't have a chance.    Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,   for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even   chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into   the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See   [KAH67].    * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?	0
" Really? Why are so you worried about high school kids ""getting their kicks"" with scanners, as compared to what the feds can do, and have done, to their targets?  ""Better than the status quo"" isn't good enough, I'd say. The same  technology could be implemented WITHOUT a back door open to the state.  We all know about power and corruption. But we all know that abuse is something that only happens to the other guy.    --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ John Hesse           |          A man,      jhesse@netcom.com    |                 a plan,  Moss Beach, Calif    |                         a canal, Bob."	0
Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part07 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 7: Digital Signatures and Hash Functions  This is the seventh of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is a one-way hash function? * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.? * What are MD4 and MD5? * What is Snefru?   * What is a one-way hash function?    A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and   produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally   impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't   determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not   even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also   computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the   same hash.    A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an   encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash   function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are   relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user   is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,   and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the   signature can do the same thing.    Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.  * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?    There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a   very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which   isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it   a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption   functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have   hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1   if and only if X = H(M).    A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private   decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the   previous question, have public hashing and public verification.   Digital signature functions have private hashing and public   verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,   but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.    Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to   be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real   difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key   isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend   rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing   ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.  * What are MD4 and MD5?    MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.   Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is   available from [FTPMD].    Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft   RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some   people refer to it as MD5.  * What is Snefru?	0

From: pmetzger@snark.shearson.com (Perry E. Metzger)   You obviously haven't read the information about the system. The chips  put out serial number infomation into the cypher stream to allow  themselves to be identified. The system does not rely on registering  people as owning particular phone units.  And probably as a back door to allow re-generation of the secret key.  Have we determined yet that S1 and S2 don't ever change?	0
 It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.  I can even imagine this being found legal and constitutional, since nothing is actually listened to until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained.  Imagine archiving all pay-phone conversations, so if someone turns out to be a drug dealer, you can listen to all their past drug deals.  And archive calls to/from suspected Mafia members, potential terrorists, radicals, etc.  Imagine the convenience for the police of being able to get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the World Trade Center bombers made in the past year.  Since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do, why wouldn't it happen?	0
" You can find the salient difference in any number of 5th amendment related Supreme Court opinions. The Court limits 5th amendment protections to what they call ""testimonial"" evidence, as opposed to physical evidence.  The whole question would hinge on whether a crypto key would be considered ""testimonial"" evidence. I suppose arguments could be made either way, though obviously I would hope it would be considered testimonial."	0
"Though some may argue about the nose of the camel, it's worth noting that the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony. If it is only used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to easy-to-break inverters.  Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap. Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and files, let's focus on this.  One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.  Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal less threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a ""goat"" can eavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones.  -------  Reading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.  Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to have a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of depositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week, and that system has worked pretty well.  From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that need to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in return we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly skilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to be, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries, while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.  ------  In discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and noise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue, and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion. "	0
 You've overlooked a fundamental Truth:   both headcount and budget of any government agency are  monotonic increasing functions.  Given that Truth, you need to look for what the agency can do to occupy all those people and spend all that money when crypto is unbreakable.  Perhaps they could talk the world's telephone companies into making equipment they could break into and tap.  Maybe they could convince people that distributed computing was a good idea so that even the internal state of a process would be available for access by wiretapping.  Maybe.... 	0
It seems to me that all discussions about Clipper security are almost  irrelevant - if I cannot choose the key, but have to use a key chosen for me by the foundry, the security of the WHOLE UNIVERSE OF USERS is as good (or as bad) as the security of VLSI Technologies Inc.  It is a trivial effort to run any ciphertext agains ALL THE KEYS EVER  MANUFACTURED - after all we are talking about 1 to 100 million keys that will ever be manufactured. The key depositories can be as secure and incorruptible as they wish to be, nobody cares anyway...:-(  Now if someone would convince me that the shipping docks of VTI, ATT and others are impenetrable (remember: the chips have to ship with the key -  you or the dealer are going to submit it to the authorities eventually) I'd be a bit happier. But do we really believe that the various governments (including ours) won't have the full lists of all the keys ever manufactured?  Did I miss something here?  My own opinions, quite obviously... --	0
[A lot of this article has been deleted for space.] 	0
 Agreed.  Remember, I don't even think of Clipper as encryption in any real  sense--if I did, I'd probably be a lot more annoyed about it.   That's not for Clinton (or anyone under him) to say, though.  Only the  federal and supreme courts can say anything about the constitutionality. Anything the administration or any governmental agency says is opinion at  best. 	0
    No wonder American businesses are going down the tubes! :-|   (It's NIST, not NSA.  NSA is not supposed to have anything to do with this.) They didn't say that.  They said is was better than some commercial-grade encryptions.  I, for one, wouldn't trust them if they did, unless they release the algorithm for investigation.   Maybe the ACLU and EFF.  (It would have to be a non-profit, so the big 8 would be out.)   I wouldn't trust the NSA.  I think I would trust the President on this, but I'm not certain he would be told.   That's your problem.   I want to emphasize the I am not speaking for Beckman Instruments at this point.  However, we are an international company, and I would like to think that our customers come first, ahead of our government's whims.	0
"     I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders. It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology, and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now.      The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs, probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say) a DES keysearch machine.      As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak- nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for (say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for.)      How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers? ""Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately. Maybe I can help...""        Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant to ""practical cryptanalysis.""  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And NSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of police organizations and courts across the land."	0

 My speculation does not include or depend upon a trapdoor in RSAREF. I do not believe that RSA would consent to such.    However, there are other limitation in the concept of RSAREF in which NSA has an interest.  It has an interest in a limited number of implementations, i.e., targets.  It has an interest in fixed key or maximum modulus size.    It has a legitimate (literally) right to pursue such interests.  Within bounds, it probably has a right to pursue those interests by covert means.  At least it has the same right as the rest of us not to disclose all of its motives and intentions.  (Institutions are not self-aware; they do not know their intentions in any meaningful sense.)	0
Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part04 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 4: Mathematical Cryptology  This is the fourth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.   Contents:  * In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem? * What is an attack? * What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically? * Why is the one-time pad secure? * What's a ciphertext-only attack? * What's a known-plaintext attack? * What's a chosen-plaintext attack? * In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks? * What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?   * In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?    A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a   decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of   functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of   ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the   decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that   D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption   of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key   (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext   into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to   encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.  * What is an attack?    In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method   of starting with some information about plaintexts and their   corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out   more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state   mathematically what this means. Here we go.    Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,   and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.    An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an   algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that   there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have   f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this   probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).    The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at   least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and   g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible   ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other   words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions   E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).    An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if   n = 2, and so on.  * What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?    In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.   Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this   property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem   is strong!''    In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely   formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is   strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against   all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as   defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this   statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist   any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement   to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that   the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.    Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical   definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions   we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can   figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used   properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.    The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst   can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to   construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,   and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.    * Why is the one-time pad secure?    By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the   plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)   of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive   or) of K and P.    It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial   single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform   distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform   distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,   i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,   with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and   g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of   K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also   be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is   uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p   that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus   a fortiori A is trivial.)    On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used   for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial   multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be   thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';   this explains the name ``one-time pad.''  * What's a ciphertext-only attack?    In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is   constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about   n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some   information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial   if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given   G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.    For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can   easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply   guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use   the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no   matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which   produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.   If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is   a nontrivial attack.  * What's a known-plaintext attack?    The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,   G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.   In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption   P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the   other decryption P_2.    Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature   as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the   cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him   decrypt further messages.  * What's a chosen-plaintext attack?    A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical   series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the   cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into   our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a   chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and   look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured   out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of   attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''    A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption   attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a   way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.    There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:   for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as   T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew   for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash   function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.  * In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?    Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some   plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're   also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find   K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).    If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed   on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results   only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial   attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many   possible keys.  * What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?    Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys   randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to   for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which   are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English   words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much   faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.	0
Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part02 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 2: Net Etiquette  This is the second of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here? * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt? * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?   * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?    Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always   make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.   You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same   newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the   readers want to see.  * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?    No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were   created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be   patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many   sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,   comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of   people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your   postings in the right group.    Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic   ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.  * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?    ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some   ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a   doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.    If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some   ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by   random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the   opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is   distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some   systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts   and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but   this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most   sci.crypt readers won't bother with.    So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,   find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and   related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the   introductory textbooks.    When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at   large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens   of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily   answered on your own.    If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some   reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your   system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to   sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated   in some areas.)    If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.   You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted   cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break   Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough   experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will   be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to   consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more   layer of complication and come back for another round.    A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA   look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope   of this FAQ.	0

Generally, an organization has influence in proportion to:   The narrowness of its objectives  The number of members  The strength of belief of its members  This is why the pro- and anti-abortion groups are so strong: narrow objectives, lots of interested members who are real passionate.  For this reason, mixing with the NRA is probably a bad idea.  It diffuses the interests of both groups.  It may well diminish the Passion Index of the combined organization.  It is not clear it would greatly enlarge the NRA.  So, I believe a new organization, which may cooperate with NRA where the two organization's interest coincide, is the optimum strategy.  lew	0
"The key question is whether non-Clipper encryption will be made illegal.   The clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that Americans have the right to Clipper encryption, but not to unbreakable encryption. This implies that, ultimately, non-Clipper strong encryption must become illegal.  (As an aside, isn't the language here jarring?  All this talk about ""harmonious balance"" when they're talking about taking away people's right to communications privacy?)  Although the article emphasizes voice communication, data and mail encryption is mentioned as well:    It looks like the worst nightmares raised by Dorothy Denning's proposals are coming true.  If the government continues on this course, I imagine that we will see strong cryptography made illegal.  Encryption programs for disk files and email, as well as software to allow for encrypted voice communications, will be distributed only through the ""underground"".  People will have to learn how to hide the fact that they are protecting their privacy.  It's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here."	0
I think I should also point out that the mystical DES engines  are known plaintext engines (unless you add a ton of really smart  hardware?)  Assume the ton of smart hardware.  It doesn't really have to be that smart.	0
  I suspect that the decisive element in the political battle will be the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) factor.   If the people who would be end users of the Cripple Chip hear of the whole debate only vaguely -- the government says it's solid; other people in the field say it's Swiss cheese -- the balance of doubt could shift against the Feds.  Any attempt to limit other forms of encryption could then be presented as the government covering its own butt by protecting its poor product from superior competition.   Comments?  	0
 Or John Edgar Hoover's USA.   yet.   yet.   so far.   What harm is there in overreacting? This may be the largest single threat to civil liberties yet in my lifetime.  The US has done some pretty heinous things in the past,  and we haven't yet recovered from all of them.  There certainly seems to be a historical trend towards less liberty, with occasional perturbations.   Time to break out the quotes from American political radicals.

" True in theory.  In practice?  The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.  Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule today.  But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge, ""Hey, can we have permission to listen to those tapes?"" can they?   Yes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they can win just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They don't even have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.  They don't catch the really smart crooks anyway.   John Gotti, who would have to be retarded not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped, glibly chatted away on his tapped phone about murder plans.  That's why he's in jail now. Hard to believe, but true.   This scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more, which people would fight a lot harder.  They like this enough that they are dropping the so called ""Digital Telephony"" proposal, according to rumours.  However the meaning of that is complex, since they still want to get at the crypttext on telco systems, and that requires a bit of work."	0

  The description of the chip's operation evidently leaves out some of the key management aspects.  Either the K_P is the secret key corresponding to a public key which is broadcast at message initiation, or it is the result of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange or something similar.  Either way there must be some protocols beyond those described here.  It isn't clear whether they are implemented in the Clipper wiretap chip or must be provided by other system components.	0
"Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Congress??  So we're playing politics before we talk to CPSR, academia, the public, internet users?  I`ve heard of top-down design, but top-down  democracy?? [Just whose state/district are the chip manufacturers in?]  Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review. [...bs about      the wonderfulness of the key escrow system...]       The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have      effectively done);   They'll just provide an easily-compromised version to JQ Public.                           nor is the U.S. saying that ""every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.""    Maybe we need a CRA -- Cryptographic Rights Amendment.                                                    There is a      false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is      an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper      Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.  Nice lullaby.  But why am I not soothed?  ---------------- Also,    Why repeat themselves?  It appears to some (and the story looks pretty convincing to me, too) that the Justice Department stole a case-tracking system, modified it, and distributed it to ""friendly"" police and suchlike agencies around the world, eg. the Canadian Mounties.  Of course, I have  no doubt they swore Scout's Honor that there were no backdoors.  With that kind of intelligence, who'd want to be swamped with terabytes of commercial traffic?"	0

Cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the   /pub/cypherpunks directory.  It's written in PERL, and is   relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).   Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and   modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are   amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites   become operational. Address all points in the section   ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to   advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term   stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.  _____ <4.8> What are references on privacy in email?

For more   information send email to crosslink@athena.mit.edu.   MISCELLANEOUS =============  _____ <5.1> What is ``digital cash''?    With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the   possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be   realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks   (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may   be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and   anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an   economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum   (~Dec.1992).    An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus   <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the   cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to   elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:      ::     command: help          user@host    where `user@host' is your email address.      _____ <5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?    These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,   especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past   a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as   breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most   internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a   ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,   curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a   system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and   patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also   the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.     _____ <5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?    From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:    > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were   > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy   > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,   > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant   > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people   > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,   > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek   > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or   > their opinions.    See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.    See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary   in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.  _____ <5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?    Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the   techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication   but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself.    Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the   proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible   to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,   typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is   posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually   untraceable  communication can take place between sender and   receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic   realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where   individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual   users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An   anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman   (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to   <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following   commands in the subject line:      subscribe     unsubscribe     help  _____ <5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?    `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain   protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information   or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make   public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade   `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be   concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in   operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that   some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious   because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This   argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet   posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a   very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at   worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ   for alt.security.        Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic   Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First   International Symposium on National Security & National   Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:    > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep   > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's   > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If   > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there   > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I   > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into   > an environment where any information which is at all interesting   > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little   > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,   > but you may differ...  _____ <5.6> What are `identity daemons'?      RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to   query a remote user's login name after connection to a local   communication socket (a connection of this type is established   during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not   widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement   it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to   anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system   adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a   trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.  _____ <5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?     Remailing/Posting   -----------------      - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,     publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.   - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET     postings.   - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information     obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,     encrypted addresses, etc.)   - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and     remailer site chaining.      General   -------      - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy     shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the     general public and their governments.   - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies      by systems designers into     hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'     `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.   - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than     wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement     agencies.   - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government     agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to     strengthening and protecting it.   ISSUES ======  _____ <6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?    From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:    > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic   > media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like   > electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis   > of new forms of community.  These communities without a single,   > fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an   > electronic frontier.   >    > While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give   > structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like   > newspapers, books, and telephones, the new digital media do not   > so easily fit into existing frameworks.  Conflicts come about as   > the law struggles to define its application in a context where   > fundamental notions of speech, property, and place take   > profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the   > threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies,   > even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the   > workplace and the home.   >    > The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to help   > civilize the electronic frontier; to make it truly useful and   > beneficial not just to a technical elite, but to everyone; and to   > do this in a way which is in keeping with our society's highest   > traditions of the free and open flow of information and   > communication.      EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor, founder of   Lotus software, and John Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead   rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization   involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI   raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve   Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector   Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.      In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee   with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated   November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented   Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national   public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly   by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in    ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):    > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to   > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create   > a consumer-oriented, public information network. Please let me or   > my staff know what policies you and others in the computer   > industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating   > a reasonably priced, widely available network in which   > competition is open and innovation rewarded.  I also want to   > learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past ten   > to fifteen years should apply to the current debate on   > structuring the information and communications networks of the   > future....I ask your help in gaining input from the computer   > industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will   > bring this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the   > information services industry.      ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/eff/about-eff   ---     A file of basic information about EFF including goals, mission,     achievements, and current projects.

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been   working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues   since ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,   Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation   against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other   U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation   on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,   NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in   Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on   Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to   testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and   caller identification.    CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available   via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising   the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For   more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.     (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions   here.)  _____ <6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?    In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies   on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in   such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.      (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):    > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May   > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card   > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success.    > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying   > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of   > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some   > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department   > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide   > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of   > jurisdictions.    Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated   instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a   crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal   search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of   Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST   by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science   Fiction Magazine:    > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional   > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the   > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared   > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,   > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin   > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only   > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place.    > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that   > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document   > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.    FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed   on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier   Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe   Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:      > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret   > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal   > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a   > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,   > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment.    >    > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in   > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,   > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke   > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer   > seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of   > computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first   > case to challenge the practice.    >    > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin   > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never   > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal   > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and   > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine   > that the company was a publisher. Indeed, agents testified that   > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the   > special Secret Service school on computer crime.    >    > ""How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what   > Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?"" asked Sparks. ""An hour?    >    > ""Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to   > Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything   > taken?    >    > ""Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had   > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen   > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect?    >    > ""Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material   > could harm Steve Jackson economically?""    >    > Foley replied, ""No, sir,"" but the judge offered his own answer.    >    > ""You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go   > out and hire a lawyer and sue you.""    >    > More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier    > Foundation in bringing the case to trial. The EFF was founded by    > Mitchell Kapor amid a civil liberties movement sparked in large   > part by the Secret Service computer crime crackdown.      ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/cud/papers/sundevil   ---     A collection of information on Operation SunDevil by the Epic     nonprofit publishing project.

ISDN is a high-speed data communications standard that utilizes   existing copper telephone lines, and is a possible inexpensive and   intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone   networks.  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and   video transmission applications.  G.

FOOTNOTES =========   _____ <7.1> What is the background behind the Internet?     The article ``Internet'' in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce   Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> contains general and nontechnical   introductory notes on origins of the Internet, including the role   of the RAND corporation, the goal of network resilience in face of   nuclear attack, MIT, UCLA, ARPANET, TCP/IP, NSF, NREN, etc.:    > ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989, a happy victim of its    > own overwhelming success.  Its users scarcely noticed, for   > ARPANET's  functions not only continued but steadily improved.    > The use of  TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now   > global.  In 1971, a  mere twenty-one years ago, there were only   > four nodes in the  ARPANET  network.  Today there are tens of   > thousands of  nodes in  the Internet,  scattered over forty-two   > countries, with more coming  on-line every day.   Three million,   > possibly four million people use  this gigantic   > mother-of-all-computer-networks.      >    > The Internet is especially popular among scientists, and is    > probably the most important scientific instrument of the late    > twentieth century.   The  powerful, sophisticated access that it    > provides to specialized data and personal communication  has sped   > up the pace of scientific research enormously.     >    > The Internet's pace of growth in the early 1990s is  spectacular,    > almost ferocious.  It is spreading faster than cellular phones,   > faster  than fax machines.  Last year the Internet was growing at   > a rate of  twenty percent a *month.*  The number of `host'   > machines with direct  connection to TCP/IP has been doubling   > every year since  1988.   The Internet is moving out of  its   > original base in military and  research institutions,  into   > elementary and high schools, as well as into  public libraries   > and the commercial sector.

"From: Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>   The majority of the discussion involving this ""Clipper Chip"" seems to  pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone  know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog  signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.  I'd lay a few bucks that its just data-in-data-out in parallel.  I suspect to make it a phone you'd need a codec and speech compression.  There would be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal, which I suspect would scupper any of the suggestions I've seen here about putting a different encryption front end on it.  There's no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs.  I'm sure it's purely a digital chip.  The back end will come later, but I'm *positive* it won't be left to the manufacturers - they all have to be the same modulation scheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap them.  The only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN phones. (Puts a whole new spin on EFFs obsession about ISDN if true, bwahahaha! ;-) )"	0

"    From: amanda@intercon.com (Amanda Walker)     > Oh great. Wonderful news. Nobody can listen in--except the feds.      Hey, it's better than the status quo.     I am far less worried about ""the feds"" tapping my phone than high school     scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and     cordless phone calls.  I'm a political dissident. I'm scared shitless of the feds listening in on my calls. My opinions are the sort that would get me ""disappeared"" in a slightly less free society -- and who knows what sort of society we will be in in five or ten years? I have friends who have had their phones tapped -- none of this is theoretical to me.  As for ""its better than the status quo"", well, first of all, you can get a cryptophone from companies like Cylink today -- and they work well. In addition, a number of groups are now working on building software to turn any PC into a privacy enhanced phone right now -- and they are all working in overdrive mode.     And yes, I'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted, but this is at     least an incrememental improvement for certain applications...  There ARE no crypto restrictions... yet. You can use anything you want RIGHT NOW. The point is to maintain that right.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com"	0
"   As John Gilmore has pointed out repeatedly, if you produce the infrastructure that would permit a police state to function, all that is required to suddenly find yourself living in one is a change of attitude on the part of the government.  Our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to ensure freedom in our country. They designed the system to make it difficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons the fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the government to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? John Hancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.  Think about it. The government has everyones keys in escrow, and the FBI gets their pet ""wiretap without leaving the office"" scheme. There is a coup, which happens every day all around the world. Within hours, everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being monitored more closely than ever before possible.  Without the tools being in place, a tyranny cannot stand. With tools like this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be successfully imposed.  Why give the government tools with which to enslave you? Maybe you can trust Bill Clinton, but are you willing to tell me that you can trust EVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter? I am not willing to make that leap of faith.   I'm a political dissident. As such, I am acutely aware of what happens to political dissidents in most of the world. In most of the world, I could be killed for my beliefs. Call Amnesty International some time to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world.  All that seperates the U.S. from most of those places is a thin piece of parchment in the National Archives thats being constantly more and more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs. Coups have happened in countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years. Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted for more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced by dictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and the lives of your children and other loved ones on it?  If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually stick.   Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where hundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to dictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled men before they became a tyranny.  I, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here. Only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has happened elsewhere.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com"	0
I am a new reader of sci.crypt I would like to obtain a copy of a public domain program that can encrypt files, preferably using DES, that runs under MS-DOS.  I would also like to obtain a program which will password protect floppy disks, if this is possible.  Thanks.	0
 People have been encrypting notes in their notebooks for hundreds of years -- maybe over a thousand.  It's a long tradition dating at least back to the alchemists.  I know of nothing bad happening to them.  I would assume that nothing bad would happen to you, given this long history establishing encryption as the property of individuals, to do with as they please. 	0

" I hope there is something I don't understand about this system, but can someone tell me how these chips are going to be manufactured while maintaining each half key under total control of the separate escrow agencies? Don't both halfs of the key have to come together (in some form) at the time the chip is constructed?  Or is it built like a fusable prom, with the chip being sent to the 1st escrow agency to program its 1/2 key, then the 2nd agency to program its 1/2 key (but who invents the safeguards that prevent the 2nd agency from reading the information already programmed by the 1st)?  This isn't intended to be a flame or anything, I am just really curious how to manufacture these things while still maintaining the key escrow security without simply saying ""trust the manufacturer, they won't look""."	0
" But what about second sources for pin-compatible non-Clipper algorithm chips that also have escrowed keys?  If a ""reputable firm"" produces a chip (with escrowed key) that is a pop-in replacement for the Clipper chip in my phone, and uses an algorithm that is widely known and evaluated and ""trusted,"" then what's the problem?  The Clipper is going to be reverse engineered anyway by any organization with sufficient resources (can you say ""billions of cocaine dollars?"") so those drug dealers they're so worried about will be slipping through the cracks.  We law-abiding (non-incredibly-wealthy) citizens, naturally, will not have this recourse.  But claiming that the algorithm can't be released to prevent people from using non-key-escrowed chips is plain deceitful... analysis of the chip output will provide information on the necessary headers and whatnot, so the ""bad guys"" could build chips using a *different* algorithm and still not escrow their keys.  Or, they could just buy bunches of cheap phones at K-mart every week, and play Swap-the-Clipper-Chip with their cellular phone every day. "	0

"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----   I find this a very disturbing view!  Yes, we DO care about EVERYONE's privacy... Even if ""they"" don't know it. What happens if the gov't starts creating legislation such that the Clipper and such technologies become the only ""legal"" encryption forms?  What happens when the Clipper is the *ONLY* type of encryption chips available to the masses?  Sure, you might have your own method of encryption, but if you don't have anyone else to talk to, what use is it?  You can't assume that EVERYONE will be as open as you appear to be about encryption.  The point here is not the specific instance of the Wiretap Chip. Rather, it is like having the government telling you that they want a copy of your house key, safe-deposit box keys, etc., and telling you that ""they wont use them unless its totally neccessary.""

"  As usual, David Sternlight is demonstrating his inability to read. The proposal clearly states:  => The initiative will involve the creation of new products to => accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure => telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  It speaks about telecommunications in general. Read it again, David. Maybe you'll understand it the next time... Nah, probably not.   That's exactly what the government wants all sheep-minded people to think. Let's look at the current situation. It allows to almost anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody, unless secure (and I mean secure) encryption is used. What will happen when (""if""? Ha! optimists...) the new proposal gets accepted? Almost nobody EXCEPT SOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else, but the ability of these ""some"" to eavesdrop will be guaranteed! The proposal emphasizes on the former (""almost nobody"") - which is clearly an improvement - and ""forgets"" to mention the drawbacks of the latter (""guaranteed""). Yes, my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the strong crypto unlawful. You think that it will not happen? Good luck.   It's not just ""continued ability"". It's -guaranteed- ability.   Yeah, that's exactly what your government wants you to think. Let's take small steps, one at a time. Concentrate on the current one, don't think about the future. Trust us.   It's not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the intention. They, unlike you, read what they write.   Yes, it will. It will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now. It will allow only to the government to eavesdrop. (If the scheme is secure, of course, which is yet to be proven.) But how do you know that the jerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow? The new proposal -guarantees- him the ability to eavesdrop then. Hell, that will even motivate him to get that job - if he indeed is that mentally pervert...   Great. The Greatest Cryptographer of All Times David Sternlight (tm) has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any details whatsoever and has concluded that it is ""highly secure"". I guess, that comes from the background of working some 50 years for the two major crypto evaluating companies, right? Gee, now the government can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto experts to secretly analyse the new secret method - for David Sternlight has already done all the job for them...   ""Trust us, we're from the Government and we're here to help you.""   ""Those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises of future safety, do not deserve either."" This (or something like that; I don't have the exact quote, but the meaning is the same) has been said by one of your great men. Maybe you should study their works more carefully, if you have the brains to understand them, of course.   The main question is to guarantee to availability of -really- secure cryptography to the masses. Gee, if the proposal was saying ""we guarantee that every American will still have the full right to use any kind of encryption s/he would like and regard this proposal as just a default, voluntary implementation"", there would have been much less opposition... For some reason, they didn't even try to promise you that. I wonder why... Was Orwell off only by 10 years?   No, in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled.   While the above is just rumors, and while even if it is true, it is not done -easily-, the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily breakable by anybody who has the two keys. It might be also breakable by somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick. Or who has only one of them. NSA also told you that DES is secure, why don't you simply trust them, huh?   It is -guaranteed- to be -easily- breakable - just get the keys. It might be even easier, but until there is some evidence, this is just a wild speculation.   The trapdoors -are- there. In government's hands. The keys.   Legitimate? And who decides what communications are legitimate? Oh, I guess, it's the government, right? The guys who already have the keys? It's kinda if I have the keys from your car and I am asked to decide who has the right to use it ""legitimately""...   Impossible, since you are demonstrating the same level of incompetence and ignorance as in the provious threads.   Unfortunately, I have yet to see you posting a technically competent message.

"I have an idea as to why the encryption algorithm needs to be keep secret, and some things that i think it implies. (Of course these could all be wrong.....)   from                        THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                Dorothy Denning                            Revised, April 21, 1993  . . .  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called ""Skipjack.""  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  . . .  ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  ------------------  suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but did not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from if law enforcement field     E[E[K; U] + N; F] not knowing N would might make this much harder.  Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not), If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the other party.  If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are saying but I could know who you are saying it too.  Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be chosen from know weak keys for the system.  Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some ""panel of experts"" is going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.  So, am I wrong? Or are these problems."	0

"Here are four pseudo-random character generators, based on irreducible trinomials.  Each contains 16 separate trinomials, one of which is selected on initialization (there are 64 distinct trinomials between the 4 PRCGs).  The PRCGs are initialized with a 32-bit seed, and a 4-bit trinomial- selector.  I would like to get comments on these by anyone who is interested enough to look them over.

" This won't work if there is a checksum on the keys you don't know about. Neither will registering a clipper chip and then substituting a ""counterfeit"" one if the serial number contains a checksum.  Chances are the government has thought of this, and ""just anyone"" won't be permitted access to enough of the internals to make a ""fake"" clipper chip. Chances are that the government has classified some details of the internals at a very high level, and manufacturers are required to observe security safeguards and clearances corresponding to that level.  While not perfect, it would prevent Joe Hacker from rolling his own spoofing chip, since not many counterfeiters can survive a background investigation. Some of the more notorious self-styled dissidents here, for example, have already got their heads so high above the tall grass that they'd have little chance of getting a clearance.  Of course it's not impossible that someone do this, but probably extremely difficult. Chances are there will also be very heavy criminal penalties for phony clipper chips, on some national security/classified info grounds or other, thus making the game not worth the candle. "	0
    Simple -- if you have a choice between:   1. American manufacturers peddling Cripple Chips with a secret untested      algorithm whose keys are held by people with a history of untrustworthy      behavoir, or   2. Japanese (to pick the obvious example) manufacturers peddling encryption      chips with an algorithm that has faced public scrutiny and keys under      the control of the user,	0
 Gee. Say they feed the 80-bit key through Snefru-8 and take the first 60 bits of the result, then use those 60 bits as the real key. How do you figure out that each key is one of 2^20 ``equal'' keys? You can try a birthday attack, but if the key can be changed only once a second then you will need several lifetimes to get reliable statistics. Somehow I don't think you could catch the NSA at this sort of skulduggery.	0
" Well, I'm not a lawyer, but from what I can tell this is completely and utterly untrue.  You see, this country has this thing called a ""constitution"".  If you legitimately aquire the device, and you yourself are not a government employee or otherwise encumbered, I don't think they can stop you from revealing anything about the device you can determine. Remember the Pentagon Papers precedent? The First Amendment applies here.  The U.S. does NOT have an official secrets act. We do have laws that will punish you for revealing what classified information you learned in your capacity as a government official, contractor, etc, and we have laws that prohibit stealing such information. However, if they sell you the chip, I can't see that they can make reverse engineering it and revealing the details illegal.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com"	0

 This isn't true.  Today's criminals regularly use all sorts of unsafe methods, from cordless phones to cellular phones to plain old copper wire analog phones that you can put alligator clips on to plan and execute their crimes.  It is amazing how stupid they are, which is why the FBI was so keen on the digital telphony law, and its successor the clipper chip.  They're hoping here that most crooks will remain stupid, feel safe using clipper chip phones and get caught.	0
  ONLY IF this chip catches on. Which means alternatives have to be developed. Which will only happen if Clipper is discredited. 	0

  Good question. I also wanted to find out and I did a while ago.  In our former communist times such activity (i.e. sending crypto emails) would be prevented sooner ot later, law or no law. But now there is no law  against it. So we are free to use it. We now have an EC conformant law for  protection and registration of personal files.

"If ""I forgot"" doesn't have as much credibility as you'd like, consider this alternative.  Somewhere on the hard disk, duplicated a few times, keep a 128-bit random number.  When the 128-bit digest of your passphrase is computed, it is XORred with the random number before being used as the key for your hard disk.  Writing random junk over the random numbers makes the hard disk unreadable by anyone."	0

" Let's assume, for the moment, that the system really is secure unless you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent escrow houses.  Let's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is the ACLU and the other is the EFF.  (And I'm not entirely joking about those two names)  In that case the Prince of Wales has nothing to worry about on this system.  Indeed, as pointed out, since the current systems, even the current digital systems, are very easy to decode -- right now anybody with an old TV can hear them -- for most people, this will be viewed as an ""oh goody"" step upwards.  And look at how tolerant the public is.  They're willing to let the neighbours with the radios hear right now.  It was suggested by one person that a *lot* of non-evidentiary wiretapping is going on right now without warrants, because anybody can do it and it's just an ECPA violation.  This would stop that.  All tapping would need a warrant, or a breach of security at the escrow houses."	0
 My choice for the escow house would be the Smithsonian, and someplace on the west coast.  My biggest concern isn't that the escrow house could be compromised (it will be), but the fact it has been compromised will be kept secret.    The keys could be kept under glass, with 24-hour C-SPAN coverage.  If you thought your key had been stolen just turn on the cable, and wait until the roving camera reachs the musuem case with your key.  Or if you think the C-SPAN satellite has been compromised, take a tour of the Smithsonian yourself, and view the seal on your key. 	0
 It would be in a different location, so a directional antenna could probably lock in on just the one monitor. Failing that, a phased array could likely seperate the signals. Admittedly, this is expensive, but so is all the rest of this stuff anyway.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com	0

 Are you sure you aren't being watched?  Let me remind you that  Watergate was only the tip of the iceberg.  Nixon extensively used the NSA to watch people because he didn't like them.  According to _Decrypting the Puzzle Palace_:   Presumably, the NSA is restricted from conducting American surveillance  by both the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978(FISA) and a  series of presidential directives, beginning with one issued by  President Ford following Richard Nixon's bold misuse of the NSA, in  which he explicitly directed the NSA to conduct widespread domestic  surveillance of political dissidents and drug users.	0

 This way to detect pre-encryption may be defeated ; one can do   transformation of the spectrum of encrypted signal just by adding some  pre-arranged (in the beginning of communication) function.

"A Unix tool of cryptographic significance is available for anonymous ftp.  ""agrep 2.0.4"" -- a fast approximate pattern-matching tool  source code project available from:  cs.arizona.edu   in directory ""agrep""  agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous number of powerful search options.  The one most obviously applicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to specify the ""similarity"" of matches in the data.  For example say you make up a password/phrase of ""qimwe7l"". Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not in any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to en entry that could be varied by some ""crack"" program to brute-force search for it?  You use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none, one or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But   agrep -3 ""qimwe7l"" bigwordandphraselist  finds that the pattern ""qimwe7l"" is too close to the pattern ""imsel"" (part of ""himself"" and a host of others), to be of any cryptographic value as a key.  An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of letters like ""teh"" for ""the"".  A minimally acceptable password would have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately ruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password. (In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at *least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)   And for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o' typos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example, say I want to find out what people think about Gibson's SF book ""Neuromancer"" in the huge SF-Lover's archives. Even with an error distance specification as small as of ""1"" I will find all those people who think the title was ""Necromancer"" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?  Also, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL at Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe to look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or religious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.  You can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000 random three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that don't score the X chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size Y.  You think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing the pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find NSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency, National Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.  You can also specify ""fixed"" areas: looking for license plate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct, you might say:  agrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase  will find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors (addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can also ""weight"" the relative ""cost"" for substiutions, additions, or deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns for a particular protein combination, you might know that some kinds of damage cause the ""A"" nucelotide to drop out more than other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting -Dc where you set the ""deletion cost"" to count as ""c"" errors.  A steganographic use (I even used ""agrep -2 ""<steg>eograp"" E"" just now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...  Also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy to abstract the ""hits"" into a useful form.  For example,  agrep -d ""^From"" 'PGP;(passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)'  says output the entire mail record, delimited by 'From' that contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase', 'Zimmerman', or 'NSA'.  And agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster than the second-best similarity tool publicly available.  As usual, I will be glad to e-mail the source and docs to those who reqest them by e-mail IF they cannot do an anonymous FTP.  Get this now. It is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the ""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   ""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the ""Clipper Chip"" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.    For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.  - - ---------------------------------   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE     Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government      agencies to listen in on phone conversations?  A:   No.  ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  There is a      false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is      an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper      Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?"	0
 I agree.  This is the danger I see, not the system itself.  That is to say,  this is a political issue, not a technical one. 	0
  My MDC cipher (which uses any one-way hash function as a CFB-mode stream cipher, the current implementation uses MD5) uses a key of up to 2048 bits (that is, you can use a 1-bit key if you want and copy it over the entire 2048-bit range, or you can use the entire 2048 bits).  Runtime is independant of key size, the system runs slightly slower than MD5 itself.

Thus, this poster is essentialy arguing no crypto is better than secure crypto.

" Ok, so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the chip; the real message encrypted with the ""conventional"" key, and the serial number and encrypted ""conventional"" key encrypted with the (IMHO kind of bogus, as the whole concept of ""one key that millions of people use which can't be changed"" doesn't seem reasonable) ""family key"".  Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and I'm able to determine which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number and session key.  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session key and twiddles a bit (or several) before it's sent down the line.  Mind you, I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other attacks I can't imagine, and the system is probably somehow designed so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully.  But how? What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent bit-twiddling scheme, so the decryption chip sees the restored ""proper"" bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E[K; UK] packet that's wrong?  I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip ""sends"" that information out many times in slightly different ways, making it effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information being sent."	0
"     Yow - get some sleep Brad!

"There are many Urban Legends (maybe this ought to be in the Crypt  FAQ?) about what is actually sufficient to clear or declassify  magnetic media when used for classified data.  Here is some  information ""from the horse's mouth"".  (Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (""clearing"") meant to  be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying  the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)  From National Telecommunications and Information Systems  Security (NTISS) ""Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation  Security Guidelines""  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):  ------  ""7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk,  cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the  entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be  cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites  each location with a given character.  Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting  at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by  applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each  location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that  this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware:  some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not  actually do this.  Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or  released for destruction; however, they should be marked and  controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of  information ever recorded.  7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a  degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of  that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)  If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is  operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to  employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all  addressable locations at least three times by writing any character,  then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros)  alternatively.  When fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify  the media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two  alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk  pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved  degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the  vendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter)  removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for  destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new  platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.  7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media""  [see DoD Computer Security Center, ""Department of Defense Magnetic  Remanence Security Guideline"", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE  ONLY]  ------  This and many other interesting documents (many that are more  informative than probably intended) on computer security procedures  can be obtained (free) from:  Executive Secretary National Telecommunications and Informations   Systems Security Committee National Security Agency Fort George G.

  Hmm, here are a couple:  1) If the algorithm becomes known, it will be easy to produce pin-compatible non-crippled chips that provide -real- encryption and privacy, because their keys are only in their users' hands.  2) Since SkipJack is a symmetric key cypher, it needs some way to agree on a session key. The released information says that any protocol may be used (e.g., DH). From a theoretical point of view, this is probably true. However, from a practical point of view, those chips must have some kind of key exchange protocol built-in. What if it is good old RSA? This will mean that the producer will have to pay lots of bucks to PKP. By keeping the details secret this can be avoided...  Regards, Vesselin	0
"  Nice to think, but naive.  The fact is that millions of people today are sending highly confidential information over unencoded, easy to receive cellular phones.

If Clinton tells them it's good crypto, they'll believe him, and send important stuff over it, and be thankful that they're no longer using clear-voice FM cellular phones.

" Read it again yourself, then re-apply the admonition you gave to the previous poster to yourself, as well.  The first clause is not a condition, it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIA OR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.  This is NOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to exist by default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government shall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.  Remember the Constitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOT do.  All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to the states and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in the Bill of Rights talk about).  Since I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation, I am appending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself (and you, I suspect).  I am sure you will find his qualifications adequate. If that isn't enough I can send you the Senate Subcommitee to the Judiciary on the Constitution report on the same thing...  There are some things in there that Big Brother types, like Biden, etc must have really had to swallow hard to admit.  I think you will find that people that seriously study the Constitution and state what it means will say the same thing.  Those who come up with 'new improved meanings' are those who are trying to subvert the Constitution for a given agenda.

(And please back it up with some proof, since I am backing my assertion up with independent proof, and have a BUNCH MORE I can provide...).  NOTE:  Followups set to talk.politics.guns  --------- Begin included article -------     THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT           by J. Neil Schulman  If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan, right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call would be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?  That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr. Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of ""American Usage and Style: The Consensus.""  A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's expertise.  Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for ""Editor and Publisher"", a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field.  He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's fifth book on usage, ""American Usage and Style: The Consensus,"" has been in continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.  That sounds like an expert to me.  After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent the following letter:  ""I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.  ""The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  ""The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  ""I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further, since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under oath to support, if necessary.""  My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment, then concluded:  ""I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment. While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.""  After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):  [Copperud:] ""The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb 'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia.  ""In reply to your numbered questions:  [Schulman:] ""(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?""  [Copperud:] ""(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people.""  [Schulman:] ""(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed'?""  [Copperud:] ""(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.""  [Schulman:] ""(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed' null and void?""  [Copperud:] ""(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.""  [Schulman:] ""(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?""  [Copperud:] ""(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia.""  [Schulman:] ""(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,' 'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?""  [Copperud:] ""(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military.""  [Schulman:] ""(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200 years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.""  [Copperud:] ""To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: ""Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'  [Schulman:] ""As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence,  ""A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be infringed.'  ""My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,  ""(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?; and  ""(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?""  [Copperud:] ""(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure.  ""(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation.""  Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his cover letter: ""With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach any conclusion.""  So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.  As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.  And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely. American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms, guaranteed by the Constitution.  And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.  it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?  Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

"( Below is my response to Dr. Denning's letter to Steven Bellovin. Comments   are invited. - Paul )  In alt.privacy.clipper, Steve Bellovin posted your message to him, which included a brief passage concerning selection of agencies as escrow agencies.  I am glad to see that the proposal as written states that the escrow agencies won't be law enforcement agencies. I would argue, however, that *one* of the escrow agencies shouldn't be federal at all.  As a private citizen, I would feel much more ""secure in my person and papers"" knowing that an organization committed to individual civil liberties- the ACLU and the NRA come to mind- was safeguarding half of my key. Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported, funded, or overtly controlled by the government.  Of those federal and federally funded candidate agencies that you mentioned, I have the following comments:   - SRI, Rand, Mitre, and national labs: I agree that they have         great experience safeguarding sensitive information. I am not         convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_  information, since in any case requiring disclosure, there's        likely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly   *wrongful* disclosure.   - GAO: perhaps. I would like to see more concrete evidence of   their fidelity and ability.   - *TREASURY*? Surely you're joking. Perhaps you'd ask BATF  to safeguard keys. Maybe the Federal Reserve would be a   better choice.  Ever since last fall's ""trial balloon"" was posted in sci.crypt, your name has been synonymous with those who place a great deal of trust in the ability of government agencies and agents to act within the law.  I agree with you in part: those agencies and agents *almost always* act properly. However, there have been enough cases where _sworn agents of the Federal Government_ have acted wrongly to make me feel that having two federal agencies as key repositories is unacceptable.

  I think I should also point out that the mystical DES engines are known plaintext engines (unless you add a ton of really smart hardware?)   The 'plaintext' is digitized voice, and exists for a very short time, probably in a couple inches of copper, tops. It's flatly not available -- your bug in my office can hear my voice, and even digitize it, but it's going to get a different bitstream.

 A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at full rate (it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder).  If you want less quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variable you could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  This requires a DSP or ASICs, though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that could probably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply instruction and a few other DSP things.  If you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a second (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 8000 8-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2:1 compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about V.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work. Now add in the time for your encryption method.  You're going to need sampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or a PC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap - you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the SoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can't sample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversation a bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be required.  The only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the SoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than that I don't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so I can't estimate how fast a PC you'd need.  	0
It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you, and the escrow houses release your code to the cops, your code is now no longer secure.  It's in the hands of cops, and while I am sure most of the time they are good, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses.   What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you, at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses.  Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are laid?   In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to. Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume.  At the end of the time limit they should have to renew or replace your chip.   That's if we go with this scheme, which I am not sure I agree with.	0
 It just occurred to me why the algorithm is secret.  If it were published, one could then build physically identical clone versions of the chip that would interoperate with official Clipper chips.  But the cloner wouldn't provide the keys to the escrow houses.  Hmmn.  Or is there a technical hack that I've missed?  E.g. how about if the chips were made unprogrammed but serialized, and then shipped to the two escrow houses who programmed in their halves of the keys, but in a way that requires that secret keys known only to the escrow houses be installed as well, without which clone versions wouldn't interoperate?  This is getting awfully complicated, but that's crypto for you. 	0
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      Just a random passing thought, but can anyone cite a documented use of encryption technology by criminals and terrorists.    (Excluding the Iran-Contra Gang)   --                Shaun P. Hughes  sphughes@sfsuvax1.sfsu.edu 	0
As of yet, there has been no description of the general principles behind the Clipper proposal. For example, is this a public key system or a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person).  Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks. I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic. I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system, but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by  giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the  real 80-bit key.	0
From Denning:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    Where the session key is K, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U. Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F.  Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the family key   2) Receive Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the      law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -      checksums, sequence control, etc.).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits as used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block can be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed Federal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves, The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits of N in E[N; F].  The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the mutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme such as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block can be recovered are lessened.  What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the serial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission becomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?  One way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block containing M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.  The goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to  detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law enforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state for use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.  It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within the clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for, requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting and decrypting E(M; K);  The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including on the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could be subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?  Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without redress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial number.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should not be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for procurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough, stealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice from a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and  distribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen clipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not  sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream. This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted stream.  Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme.  ******************************************************************************  If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching the remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement block.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators, such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.  The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints.  The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's supposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock?  *****************************************************************************	0
 Even if they somehow address this issue it is unlikely to be the only back door in -- they might even have a few intentionally visible to distract from the ones that aren't visible.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com	0
Secrecy in Clipper Chip  The serial number of the clipper chip is encrypted with the system key and transmitted as one part of a three part message.  Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.	0
