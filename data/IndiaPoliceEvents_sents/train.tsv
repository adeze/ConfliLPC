new delhi: in view of the volatile political situation confronting the country, the ruling national democratic alliance (nda) may look for a successor to lok sabha speaker g m c balayogi, who died in a helicopter crash in andhra pradesh sunday morning, from within the telugu desam party (tdp) to maintain the delicate political equilibrium at the centre.  	0	0	0	0	0
this is because of the pivotal role of the tdp, which is the second largest party supporting the ruling nda.	0	0	0	0	0
also, tdp chief and andhra pradesh chief minister n chandrababu naidu enjoys excellent rapport with prime minister vajpayee and the nda leadership.  	0	0	0	0	0
deputy speaker p m sayeed would be conducting monday''s proceedings in the lok sabha.	0	0	0	0	0
chances of his elevation to the speaker''s post are considered slim since the ruling alliance would not like to be seen to be surrendering the crucial parliamentary post to the opposition.  	0	0	0	0	0
among the names being mentioned for the speaker''s post are tdp''s leader in the lok sabha yerran naidu, m venkateswarulu who was minister in the united front government, and m rajaiah, a leading tdp member who, like balayogi, is from backward class.	0	0	0	0	0
yerran naidu is considered close to the chief minister and was his nominee in the united front governments of deve gowda and i k gujral.	0	0	0	0	0
he is also among the more experienced of the tdp members in parliament.  	0	0	0	0	0
incidentally, yerran naidu was the first choice of chandrababu naidu when the party was offered the lok sabha speakership in 1998.	0	0	0	0	0
his flight from hyderabad was delayed, forcing the tdp to nominate balayogi to beat the deadline for nominations.	0	0	0	0	0
the opposition was battling for the post, challenging the fragile ruling alliance, which lacked majority support.	0	0	0	0	0
balayogi''s nomination brought the tdp into the alliance.  	0	0	0	0	0
he is also the first to die in office.	0	0	0	0	0

he permitted the then orissa chief minister giridhar gomango, who had continued to be a lok sabha member during the six-month period stipulated for allowing him to choose his legislature, to vote on the no-confidence motion against the government.	0	0	0	0	0
his critics in the nda questioned the political propriety, but could not question the action on legal grounds.	0	0	0	0	0

former mumbai police commissioners such as julio ribeiro, satish sahney and r.h. mendonca are the leading lights of the mohalla committees that have put pressure on the police to maintain peace and harmony.  	0	0	1	0	0

the role of governor sundar singh bhandari, who is expected to send his monthly report to the centre on the law and order situation in the state this week, is coming under scrutiny because of his low visibility all through the violence rocking the state which has claimed nearly 600 lives so far.	0	0	0	0	0
and now, even the congress is training its guns at bhandari, himself a former rss pracharak, a trait he shares with chief minister narendra modi.	0	0	0	0	0
"former chief minister and sitting congress mp shankersinh vaghela says, ""we don''t expect anything much from the three former pracharaks - modi, bhandari and advani - who will clearly take a hindu line""."	0	0	0	0	0
normally, the governor sends his monthly report to the centre on the 6th of every month and the present report will be despatched in a day or two.	0	0	0	0	0
but opposition leaders say there were all indications that the governor will bail out modi instead of criticising the sluggish reaction of the bjp government in trying to bring the situation under control.	0	0	0	0	0
"says vaghela, ""given the fact that bhandari has been a senior functionary of the bjp, i don''t think he will deviate from the official line being taken by the central and state governments."	0	0	0	0	0

the governor''s report is eagerly awaited even though the contents are never made public by the raj bhavan or the union home ministry, which receives it because it may fuel pressure from the nda allies for dismissal of the modi government for alleged complicity in the riots and delayed reaction to contain the situation.	0	0	0	0	0
"opposition leaders said there was a need for the governor to be ''objective'', but ""this was too much to expect from bhandari given his pro-bjp track record""."	0	0	0	0	0

the communal disturbances that rocked the city for one week has caused heavy losses of around rs 300 crore to the production and sale of fabrics manufactured in 18 textile mills and over 200 process houses and powerloom units - a majority of them still closed as fear stricken workers have left for their native places.	0	0	0	0	0
according to a rough survey made by the ahmedabad textile mills association and the textile labour association the representative union over 1,00,000 workers employed in these units have suffered loss of wages totalling to around rs 10 crore due to the disturbances in last few days, the tla general secretary manhar shukla said.	0	0	0	0	0

he lamented that around 25 textile mills had closed down following textile crisis in eighties and now only 18 of them were functioned and out of that some units of the national textile corporation were on the verge of closure and therefore the losses to the production and wages were less as compared to that of rs 30 crore in 1969.	0	0	0	0	0

mumbai: stevedoring in mumbai has almost come to an end with just ten firms still holding licences while the others have surrendered their right to supervise loading and unloading of vessels because it has become unremunerative.  	0	0	0	0	0
for over 200 years, they formed the backbone of the ports and shipping industry because they could delay loading and unloading of vessels, forcing a ship owner into penury.	0	0	0	0	0
but from earning crores of rupees each month, today these stevedores collectively owe the mumbai port trust (mbpt) about rs 20 crore by way of workers'' wages which they are unable to pay because their earnings have dipped with the falling container traffic in this port, according to mbpt sources.  	0	0	0	0	0
twenty-one firms were once members of the bombay stevedores association (bsa) which was set up in september 1953.	0	0	0	0	0
but after the jawaharlal nehru port trust (jnpt) was set up on may 1, 1989, huge container vessels had to go there because the centuries-old mbpt did not have enough water depth to allow huge container vessels to berth.  	0	0	0	0	0
so from handling 600,000 containers each year, the mbpt container traffic dwindled to just about 250,000 containers per year while the occupancy rate of its 24 berths also fell to less than 50 per cent, according to bsa president resham singh.  	0	0	0	0	0
each stevedoring firm had to fork out about rs 12 lakhs per month because they had to pay the workers their wages.	0	0	0	0	0
also, global shipping lines such as maersk preferred to use ports such as kandla or even the minor ports such as pipav, dahej and porbandar in gujarat, where the cost of loading and unloading was much cheaper.  	0	0	0	0	0
the indiscriminate allotment of licences by the mbpt to combat the monopoly of the stevedores who earlier did not allow new entrants into their cartel also speeded up the death of the industry.	0	0	0	0	0

"new delhi: the vajpayee government is building a case for handing over to the ramjanambhoomi nyas at least part aEUR"" if not the entire aEUR"" 67 acres of land in the immediate vicinity of the demolished babri masjid acquired by the centre in december 1992."	0	0	0	0	0
"highly placed sources in the government say that if the acquired land is divided into ""essential"" land aEUR"" needed to maintain the security of the disputed 40x80 feet on which the mosque stood as well as access to it aEUR"" and ""superfluous, excess"" land beyond it, ""there should be no objection"" to handing over the latter to the vhp."	0	0	0	0	0
not just that, the sources maintain there are provisions in sections 6 and 7 of the acquisition of certain area at ayodhya act, 1993, which entitle the centre to hand over the land to the rjn.	0	0	0	0	0
"the reason why the vhp''s demand is being given such serious consideration is not merely the organisation''s capacity for trouble, but a growing sense in the ranks of the bjp leadership aEUR"" after the party''s abysmal performance in the recent assembly elections aEUR"" that only the revival of the hindutva card can infuse a fresh life into a moribund organisation."	0	0	0	0	0
"at the same time, a section in the government feels that, given the current ""surcharged atmosphere"" in gujarat and elsewhere in the country, this is not the right time to hand over the land, for which the vhp has now announced a fresh deadline of june 2."	0	0	0	0	0
official sources say there are three options on handing over of the land.	0	0	0	0	0
"but in 1994, the supreme court, in its advisory opinion on the validity of the acquisition act, had said that not just the fate but the extent of the ""superfluous"" land could only be determined after the title suit for the disputed spot was decided."	0	0	0	0	0
next comes section 6, which is also being invoked as an option and which, incidentally is the one generally touted by the vhp: that the land can be given to any trust created after 1993, provided it adheres to conditions imposed on it by the government.	0	0	0	0	0
but the rjn was created well before 1993, and it would be a travesty to hand it over to it even if it floated a fresh trust.	0	0	0	0	0
"not just that, the supreme court had pointed out in 1994 that extra land had been acquired by the centre so that in case the title suit was eventually won by the muslims, ""their success should not be thwarted by denial of proper access to enjoyment of rights in the disputed area by exercise of rights of ownership of hindu owners of the adjacent properties""."	0	0	0	0	0
in short, if the centre invokes section 7 to give the land to the rjn, no construction can begin anyway.	0	0	0	0	0

new delhi: the vajpayee government breathed a sigh of relief on thursday as vhp leader ashok singhal, in his capacity as managing trustee of the ramjanambhoomi nyas, gave a commitment to abide by the court verdict in the ayodhya case, even as the kanchi shankaracharya declared that the government would deal only with the rjn, and the vhp should stay out.	0	0	0	0	0
this has now re-opened the possibility of the government permitting the bhoomi puja in ayodhya on march 15 -- on which a final decision is yet to be taken.	0	0	0	0	0
"it would have to be ""scaled down, with no bringing in of building material or carved pillars, and no concentration of kar sevaks""."	0	0	0	0	0
further, restrictions on kar sevaks entering ayodhya could only be lifted once the vhp agreed that they would not come there.	0	0	0	0	0
but it is not clear whether singhal was speaking in his individual capacity with rjn chief ramchandra paramhans -- who had written to the pm on march 5 only promising status quo till the court verdict -- remaining incommunicado and other vhp leaders silent.	0	0	0	0	0
"as one minister put it, "" the bjp leadership has lost all credibility with its cadres, and has to do something to end that alienation first."""	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 11, 2002  patiala: after a long period of seven years, smiles have returned on the faces of potato growers in punjab.	0	0	0	0	0
the rate of the potato crop was decreasing every year and during last season in september-october 2000, the farmers, especially in the doaba region, were forced to throw their yield on the roads for which the police had registered cases against the farmers.	0	0	1	0	0
in many other areas of the state the farmers had not gone to lift their bags kept in the stores as the rent of the stored crop was much higher than the market price of the yield	0	0	0	0	0
and they were not in position to pay the rent of the stored yield.	0	0	0	0	0
in the beginning of the present season in the last week of october 2001, the rate of fresh potatoes had gone up to rs 700 per bag and there was good demand of the yield in delhi, uttar pradesh and gujarat due to which most of the farmers started sending their entire yield to the mandis, disclosed amrik singh of raisal village.	0	0	0	0	0
according to an estimate the farmers sent their fifty per cent of crop to the mandis in the early months of the season.	0	0	0	0	0
however, the early crop was under blight disease in many areas of the state and the yield was less than the expectations but there was no loss to the farmers and many of them sold the entire crop even without sparing seed for the next year.	0	0	0	0	0
however, the present market price of the potato is rs 275 per bag of 80 kg bag as compared to the last season''s price of rs 80 per bag, but at present the potato seed is being sold at the rate of rs 500 per bag.	0	0	0	0	0
it is worth while to note that the rate of the crop is increasing day by day since the last week as the farmers have started storing their yield in hand in hope of more profit.	0	0	0	0	0

vadodara: with kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi kick-starting the female foeticide controversy, sahiyar, a city-based woman''s organisation has organised a unique competition of short story, play, songs and poetry writing on the theme of promoting the girl child and showing female foeticide in poor light.	0	0	0	0	0
the competition would provide a counterpoint to what many ngos feel is the increasing incidence of popular serials showing women as subservient to men.	0	0	0	0	0
the most blatant example was a recent episode of kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi, where a couple is congratulated after a sex-determination test predicts the foetus is male.	0	0	0	0	0

another reason for organising this competition is to get people to start thinking on the issue of the girl child and the concept of female foeticide.	0	0	0	0	0
most people do not think on these issues as it is not written about, as there is a lacunae of literature on female foeticide.	0	0	0	0	0

even in this age, we have seen well-to-do families opting to kill the foetus when they find it to be a female.	0	0	0	0	0

: there is no evidence yet of the isi''s involvement in the attack on sabarmati express in gujarat, say intelligence officials.	0	0	0	0	0
home minister l k advani, minister of state for home i d swamy, bjp president jana krishnamurthy and the spokesperson of the ministry of extenal affairs have in various forums talked of the role of the isi and the underworld in the riots in gujarat as well as the attack on the sabarmati express.	0	0	0	0	0
however, unlike the december attack on parliament or the attack on the american center in kolkata where the involvement of international terrorist organisations was proved beyond doubt, there is no concrete evidence yet to link the gujarat violence to outside forces, say intelligence officials.	0	0	0	0	0
"minister of state omar abdullah quickly withdrew his statement that the riots were due to ""local factors"" and later issued a clarification that his utterances were in a personal and not official capacity."	0	0	0	0	0
there were reports from kolkata that some terrorists linked to the gujarat carnage had been arrested, but the reports were denied by the government.	0	1	1	0	0
coincidentally, underworld don aftab ansari who was deported from the uae recently is currently held by the gujarat police, and according to sources, did not know about the attack.	0	1	1	0	0

"indeed, some officials privately admit that the government trying to play the ""foreign hand"" may be an attempt to shield itself."	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 9, 2002  mumbai: following its debacle in the recently concluded zilla parishad polls, the congress-led democratic front government seems to be losing its political will to push through a scheme to reform the milk purchase scheme in the state.	0	0	0	0	0
for the second time now, the state government has decided to put on hold its decision to ask milk cooperatives to sell at least 20 per cent of their milk collection	0	0	0	0	0
locally.the decision, taken last year, was to be put into effect from january 1	0	0	0	0	0

maharashtra is probably the only state where the government plays an active role in the dairy sector.	0	0	0	0	0
it buys 16.5 lakh litres of milk every day from about 65 unions, which causes a loss of about rs 200 crore per year.	0	0	0	0	0
the conversion costs a total loss of rs 5 per litre.	0	0	0	0	0
for 2001-02, the government has produced 17,000 tonnes of powder and 13,000 tonnes of butter, of which about 3,000 tonnes in each case remains unsold.	0	0	0	0	0
dairy experts say there is simply no escape from encouraging local consumption of milk since exports from the country are too low today at 0.1 per cent to make much of a difference if they are increased.	0	0	0	0	0

the co-operative model in maharashtra does not work the same way as that in gujarat.while the gujarat cooperatives have grouped themselves under amul, which is manned entirely by milk producers, cooperatives in maharashtra are controlled by politicians.aEURoe their politicisation has weakened their performance; there is lack of accountability, and absence of a vision for growth,aEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) says an analyst.	0	0	0	0	0
this in turn affects the well-being of the farmer.	0	0	0	0	0
though a producer gets a higher price in maharashtra than he does in gujarat, he receives no benefits from his cooperative.	0	0	0	0	0
in the amul model, the farmer gets a share in all the profits made through sales and investments by the company.while a gujarat milk producer gets rs 8.18 per litre on an average from the cooperative, a milk producer in maharashtra gets an average of rs 9 per litre.	0	0	0	0	0
further, the average cost of handling is higher here.	0	0	0	0	0

new delhi: with two days to go for the supreme court to hear a petition seeking deployment of army at the disputed site, an application was filed on monday seeking impleadment in the case suggesting simultaneous construction of a temple and a mosque at the site.	0	0	0	0	0
the petition ,filed through the united lawyers'' front''s president anis suhrawardy, said the ayodhya issue was affecting the secular fabric of the country and hence it was necessary to apprise the supreme court to restrain the government from subjecting itself to the pressure of either the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) or the babri masjid action committee (bmac).	0	0	0	0	0
"this could be done by ""constituting a committee of former chief justices, judges, eminent jurists, journalists and people from the field of art and culture belonging to both the communities to undertake the work of construction of the ram mandir and simultaneously of a masjid"", it said."	0	0	0	0	0
the apex court would hear on march 15 another petition seeking contempt of court proceedings against vhp leadership and former uttar pradesh chief minister rajnath singh for violating the status quo orders.    	0	0	0	0	0

journalists constantly wring their hands over the growing criminalisation of politics, and call on political parties to choose better candidates.	0	0	0	0	0
such moral lecturing is vacuous.	0	0	0	0	0
criminals are not entering politics because of some inexplicable moral lapse by candidate selection committees, but because they have huge incentives to get in.	0	0	0	0	0
to get them out, we must change the incentive system.	0	0	0	0	0
many laws need changing, but one single change can have a huge impact.	0	0	0	0	0
in one stroke, that will create a huge disincentive for criminals to contest elections.	0	0	0	0	0
many will resign from the legislatures to escape the consequences.	0	0	0	0	0
today, criminals join politics to gain influence and ensure that cases against them are dropped or not proceeded with.	0	0	0	0	0
but this does not keep criminals out of politics because legal delays, often abetted by political pressures, make convictions of resourceful crooks rather rare.	0	0	0	0	0
criminals threaten witnesses with death, and the feeble state cannot protect them.	0	0	0	0	0

the rule of law is supposed to ensure that anybody else who uses force is jailed.	0	0	0	0	0
they can use force with impunity.	0	0	0	0	0

a criminal who can collect protection money is as powerful as an official tax-collector.	0	0	0	0	0
a don who can use force to settle disputes is actually superior to the state, which is unable to settle disputes because of legal delays.	0	0	0	0	0
a criminal candidate who can capture and stuff ballot boxes is, in our twisted democracy, on par with a popular politician who wins every vote.	0	0	0	0	0
besides, dons have lots of money, which is very useful for fighting expensive election campaigns.	0	0	0	0	0
black money is needed in hoards, and here criminals have a huge comparative advantage.	0	0	0	0	0
in the up election, mayawati auctioned several candidatures to the highest bidder.	0	0	0	0	0
so, according to reports, did the samajwadi party.	0	0	0	0	0
why do dons invest large sums in getting tickets?	0	0	0	0	0
since the legal system no longer penalises theft, politicians who steal have a comparative advantage over others.	0	0	0	0	0
returns on political investments are so high that criminals are disinclined to invest in tax-free rbi bonds.	0	0	0	0	0
politics is so much more profitable, and just as tax-free.	0	0	0	0	0
so, our system has unwittingly created huge incentives for criminals to enter politics.	0	0	0	0	0
in the long run, we must clean up the legal and police system.	0	0	0	0	0
meanwhile, we need quick steps to change the incentive structure.	0	0	0	0	0
one is to provide public funding for elections.	0	0	0	0	0
the second is to have a blanket ban on defections, a major source of political profit.	0	0	0	0	0
any legislator who defects or disobeys the party whip in a vote of confidence should be forced to go back to voters for election on a new election symbol.	0	0	0	0	0

how does one explain the rout of this 'party with a difference'?	0	0	0	0	0
the real causes are, one, that the bjp could not appreciate the impact of modernity, which was making people impatient for palpable results, and two, it continued to believe that for indians, caste and religious considerations received precedence over their developmental needs.	0	0	0	0	0
consequently, it could neither read the real meaning of the creation of three new states -- although it supported their creation -- nor throw off the hindutva baggage, which it knew had become a liability.	0	0	0	0	0
behind the creation of uttaranchal, jharkhand and chhattisgarh, there was an acute sense of relative deprivation, not ethnicity.	0	0	0	0	0
it is a pity that the bjp top brass understood it but could not rise to the occasion.	0	0	0	0	0
post 9/11 the world has changed which means a no-nonsense approach to religious extremism.	0	0	0	0	0
the bjp's turning a blind eye to the hindutva brigades' christian bashing or its rowdy acts against valentine day enthusiasts have evidently not enthused voters.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 25, 2002  gandhinagar: who was responsible for application of poto in cases pertaining to the accused in the godhra train massacre?	0	0	0	0	0
while the government on friday decided to defer the application of poto in the case of the 62 persons arrested in godhra for the attack on sabarmati express on february 27, questions still persist about whose idea it was to impose poto in the first place and why did the government subsequently go back on the decision.	0	1	1	0	0
"interestingly, when asked for his comments on whose idea it was to use poto , the chief minister narendra modi said, ""may be some local policeman might have thought of it""."	0	0	1	0	0
interestingly, it was the chief minister who had described the godhra incident as an act of terrorism .	0	0	0	0	0
while the government has stated that it was done following legal opinion by the advocate general , others believe that it was done at the insistence of the prime minister''s office, following pressure from the nda allies.	0	0	0	0	0
there is also the belief that the modi developed cold feet on poto because he felt that he may have to use the same ordinance against the post-godhra rioters also.	0	0	0	0	0
however, one reason why the gujarat government may have decided to withdraw poto is that so far no concrete links have been found between them and organised terrorist groups such as the lashkar-e-toiba and the jaish-e-mohammad.	0	0	0	0	0

ahmedabad: the state government on sunday announced a 13-member committee to oversee and review the functioning of relief camps set up after the communal flare-up.	0	0	0	0	0
the members of the committee, chaired by governor sunder singh bhandari, are chief minister narendra modi, opposition leader naresh raval, former cm keshubhai patel, state bjp chief rajendrasinh rana, state congress president amarsinh chaudhary, industries minister suresh mehta, health minister ashok bhatt, mlas siddhartha patel and usmangani devdiwala, gcci president kalyan shah, sewa chairperson ela bhatt, ishwar patel of gandhi ashram and amtha desai of majoor mahajan sangh.	0	0	0	0	0
the chief secretary and principal secretary, revenue, will be permanent invitee members on the panel, which has been set up on prime minister vajpayee''s direction.	0	0	0	0	0
earleir on sunday, chief minister narendra modi met governor sunder singh bhandari immediately after his return from rajkot, to discuss the formation of the committee for monitoring the relief and rehabilitation activities to the riot-hit.	0	0	0	0	0
sources in the government told tnn that the meeting lasted for some 30 minutes.	0	0	0	0	0
the all-party delegation which had visited gujarat had made a serious complaint before vajpayee that there were instances of discrimination in the relief and rehabilitation works in the state.	0	0	0	0	0

new delhi: expressing his personal anguish at the communal violence in gujarat -- and	0	0	0	0	0
his frustration, as head of state, at the failure of the narendra modi and vajpayee governments to protect the lives of innocent citizens -- president k r narayanan declared on thursday that he would not be celebrating holi this year. ''	0	0	0	0	0
linking holi with communal harmony, narayanan observed that the festival of colours is symbolic of the multi-religious harmony that has existed in the country for centuries and the spirit of toleration that has been the essence of country's culture and civilisation.	0	0	0	0	0
apart from not celebrating holi this year, narayanan declared he would also not receive any visitor on the day.	0	0	0	0	0
if the earlier announcements by prime minister vajpayee and home minister l k advani that they would not celebrate holi had a somewhat hollow ring given their own political culpability for failing to rein in a partisan chief minister, the president's declaration is tantamount to a moral vote of no confidence in the two leaders.	0	0	0	0	0
narayanan's message takes on special significance against the backdrop of warnings by citizens' groups in gujarat that sangh parivar activists are planning fresh attacks on the state's beleaguered muslim community.	0	0	0	0	0
according reports lakhs of copies of an inflammatory and seditious pamphlet are being distributed in ahmedabad calling upon saffron extremists to indulge in more violence during holi.	0	0	0	0	0
openly inciting attacks on muslims, the anonymous pamphlet says, ''police and army you also beware, you are also hindus...	0	0	0	0	0
you should also support hindus.''	0	0	0	0	0
as on past occasions, president narayanan has not minced his words when it comes to taking a stand against violence.	0	0	0	0	0
his message does seem to be in consonance with the mood of most citizens -- who cannot understand how the riots and violence in gujarat have persisted for as long as a month.	0	0	0	0	0

senior congress leader ghulam nabi azad, who is the longest-serving member of the congress working committee (cwc), was summarily shifted to jammu and kashmir as the president of the pradesh congress committee (pcc) on wednesday.	0	0	0	0	0
(tm)s abrupt removal, which sent alarm bells ringing in congress circles, is not likely to be an isolated case.	0	0	0	0	0
the organisational revamp and key changes at the state-level have been in the offing for several months but were delayed because of congress president sonia gandhiaEUR(tm)s preoccupation first with the assembly polls and then the parliament session.	0	0	0	0	0
key changes in the party are expected within the next few days.	0	0	0	0	0
senior party leaders were at pains to explain that azad was not being sidelined and that he was being moved to j&k to strengthen the party in the state which is due to go to polls later this year.	0	0	0	0	0
congress spokesperson s jaipal reddy was quick to state that aEUR~aEUR~azad is one of the most trusted and competent leadersaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm), adding that his shift to j&k was similar to pranab mukherjeeaEUR(tm)s move to west bengal on election-eve.	0	0	0	0	0
he replaces mohammed shafi qureshi who had earlier resigned as pcc chief.	0	0	0	0	0
it is also no coincidence that azadaEUR(tm)s removal comes barely a month after the partyaEUR(tm)s dismal performance in the assembly elections in up where the aicc general secretary was in- charge.	0	0	0	0	0
congress circles are rife with speculation over the organisational changes.	0	0	0	0	0
former uppcc chief salman khurshid is being tipped to replace azad as party general secretary.	0	0	0	0	0
khurshid, however, is also in the race for the uppcc presidentship once again as there is tremendous pressure for the removal of the present state party chief s p jaiswal following the partyaEUR(tm)s poor showing in the assembly poll.	0	0	0	0	0
party insiders said aicc general secretaries mahavir prasad, mohsina kidwai and oscar fernandes are also likely to be entrusted with other responsibilities.	0	0	0	0	0

sixty per cent of the people who died due to police firing were from the majority community, the state-wide figures show.	1	0	1	0	1

in the city that is considered communally and politically most volatile, more members of the minority community died in the police firing.	1	0	1	0	1
according to figures available, 57 per cent (23 out of 40) of the people killed in the police firing belong to the minority community.	1	0	1	0	1
this figure should be seen with the toll of rioting in ahmedabad which shows that out of the 286 people killed, some 41 were hindus killed in about 5,500 rounds of firing by the police.	1	0	1	0	1
similarly in the state, of the 571 people who died in other violence, 494 people from the minority community were killed in the riots that followed the godhra carnage as compared to 77 from the majority community.	1	0	1	0	1

jehadi groups in pakistan and underworld dons like dawood ibrahim, chhota shakeel and abu salem are planning terror attacks against those they hold responsible for killing muslims in the recent communal riots in gujarat.	0	0	0	0	0
the intelligence bureau has submitted a report to the government including the prime minister on the matter.	0	0	0	0	0
the report says some of the targets are functionaries of the gujarat government including chief minister narendra modi, some police officers of the state and leaders of pro-hindu organisations.	0	0	0	0	0
ayodhya along with symbols, institutions and gatherings of hindus are also part of their planned targets.	0	0	0	0	0
the report says pakistan-backed terrorist groups operating in jammu and kashmir see the prevailing scenario as an opportunity to make recruitments for their respective outfits from amongst muslims who have been affected by the riots.	0	0	0	0	0
this is expected to enable these organisations to extend their activities to regions beyond kashmir.	0	0	0	0	0
the groups have decided not to claim responsibility for any terrorist act perpetrated under this arrangement, since it could have an adverse impact on the pakistani establishment, the report says.	0	0	0	0	0
there are also reports of firearms including ak-47 rifles, grenades and explosives being moved from south kashmir to designated areas in up and nearby areas.	0	0	0	0	0
in fact, there are indications that sahaba sainik, a bangladesh based pro- let group, has plans to infiltrate 800 of its supporters from bangladesh into the north-east to perpetrate terror attacks.	0	0	0	0	0
the assessment of the intelligence agency is that whereas it took the underworld a few months to organise the aEUR~aEUR~retaliation to the demolition of the babri masjidaEUR(tm)aEUR(tm) in 1993, this time the response may be even quicker since experience of recent years has shown easier access of terrorist outfits to weapons, explosives and other hardware on account of caches that are believed to have been created in different parts of the country.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 31, 2002  new delhi: prime minister vajpayee''s gujarat visit next week may spell the beginning of the end of narendra modi''s dispensation in the state, well placed sources in the government say.	0	0	0	0	0
continued violence even after his delhi visit, his defiant demeanour and his shooting from the hip at the media, the political opposition and even parliament have made modi''s position untenable, these sources point out.	0	0	0	0	0
though unofficial, the announcement of vajpayee''s visit a week in advance has acquired political significance.	0	0	0	0	0
the message is that the pm has decided to ignore the pressures from the sangh parivar to retain modi despite the allegations of partisan performance of his government machinery.	0	0	0	0	0
for starters, the centre may ask governor s s bhandari to send a report on the situation in gujarat to begin, belatedly, the constitutional process.	0	0	0	0	0
that this has not been done for over a month has not been lost sight of by political observers and constitutional experts familiar with past actions of the union government of the day.	0	0	0	0	0
for the ruling bjp, which initially saw gujarat as a testing ground for hindutva, the charge of there being a nexus between the violence and the movement for the ram temple in ayodhya is embarrassing for its long-term plans.	0	0	0	0	0
that violence has spread to the rural areas is seen in official circles as something unprecedented and a dangerous trend.	0	0	0	0	0
modi''s performance has embarrassed the government, which earlier this week had to take note of british foreign secretary jack straw''s statement.	0	0	0	0	0
although diplomatically worded to refer only to two missing british nationals, the statement did cover the need for communal harmony and for peace.	0	0	0	0	0
sources in the opposition and even within the ruling nda point to the gross incongruity in the centre''s constitutional behaviour.	0	0	0	0	0
that the same party (bjp) dominates the government at the centre and runs the government in gujarat, coupled with a senior member of the sangh parivar holding the gubernatorial post, has permitted a measure of political sanguinity that has now become the talking point in political circles.	0	0	0	0	0
defections, either local or organised from delhi, altered the numbers in the legislatures to cause constitutional breakdowns in several cases.	0	0	0	0	0

This story is from March 25, 2002  gandhinagar: succumbing to pressure from the nda allies on the bjp-led government at the centre, the gujarat government on friday decided to defer implementing provisions of the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) against the accused of the godhra train massacre till investigations prove they are terrorists.	0	0	0	0	0

corruption is the use of public office for private gains and the resultant effect has now filtered down to the lowest social level affecting one and all to such an extent that there is an urgent need to address the factors responsible for promoting corruption in our country, which stands among one of the most corrupt nations in the world, according to international ngo transparency international.	0	0	0	0	0
keeping this mind, the southern gujarat chamber of commerce and industry (sgcci) here on saturday has organised a meet, which will deliberate on the possible ways and means to reduce corruption in the society.	0	0	0	0	0
the chief vigilance commissioner, n vittal, will give certain guidelines in this regard while delivering his keynote address on the occasion.	0	0	0	0	0
sgcci has organised this meet in association with the surat citizens'' council trust (scct).	0	0	0	0	0
scct chairman arun jariwala told tnn that lots of confusion prevails in the society about the sections responsible for using corrupt means for their own gains.	0	0	0	0	0
often the business community becomes the convenient target, for conniving with the government authorities to serve their purpose in the form of tax evasion and getting the things done without meeting the statutory expenses, jariwala pointed.	0	0	0	0	0
but, the same class also gets affected when they act as consumers in the society.	0	0	0	0	0
hence, it would be grossly wrong to earmark a particular section for using unfair means for vested interests, he said.	0	0	0	0	0
sgcci officials, too, pointed out that the way the democracy is practiced in the country, much space is created for corrupt practices without any check and balance for effective monitoring of the whole process.	0	0	0	0	0
for example, the political funding is often the basis of origin of corruption, as by doling out money by an industrial house or group or even a small unit to the political parties, the tendency is to seek favours in terms of certain incentives or benefits, which would not be possible otherwise, a senior sgcci representative said on condition of anonymity.	0	0	0	0	0
but, with attempts at every level, it can be reduced substantially, jariwala pointed.	0	0	0	0	0
the unaccounted money in india is estimated to be in the range of rs 3,50,000 to 7,00,000 crore, more than the combined revenue of the centre and all the state governments in the last fiscal year, sources said quoting n vittal.	0	0	0	0	0
corruption has not always been perceived to have a negative impact on economic development and growth, but it denigrates the performance of the system as a whole and compromises the economy''s long-term dynamic efficiency, sgcci officials explained on the basis of vittal''s observations.	0	0	0	0	0

with the congress juggernaut marching steadily across the indian map, this is even more true today.	0	0	0	0	0
on the other hand, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the allies to justify the position the bjp has been taking on the ayodhya issue to their own muslim constituency - they must, at least, appear to be keeping the bjp on its toes.	0	0	0	0	0
