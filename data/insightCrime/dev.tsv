"Microtrafficking Getting Worse in Outskirts of Bogota, Colombia. Three years ago, a massive police operation swept through the Bronx, a small neighborhood at the center of much of the drug trafficking, prostitution and gambling taking place in Colombia's capital city of Bogota. But with little coordinated follow-up after the operation, microtrafficking networks have since splintered and expanded elsewhere across the city. In a 72-hour long operation that started on the morning of May 28, 2016, over 2,500 heavily armed police officers entered the Bronx. Authorities arrested over 650 people, seized around 100,000 doses of various drugs and a number of firearms, and captured 13 members of a dominant local gang known as Los Sayayines. In the Bronx, gangs at the time were making an average of 130 million pesos (around $38,000) per day from drug sales, according to Bogota Mayor Enrique Penalosa. The two leading gangs in the area, known locally as ""ganchos"" (hooks), reportedly made $1.5 million a month. Two days later during a press conference , Penalosa said that authorities had taken control of the Bronx and dismantled the criminal organizations operating there. Three years later, however, the consequences of this operation can be seen across Bogota. While the Bronx may have ceased to be a bastion of organized crime, microtrafficking continues to worsen across many parts of the capital. In September of this year, a report from Bogota's municipal government identified over 14 new ""ollas,"" a term given to streets where drug dealing is rampant. Authorities admitted there were likely more areas that had not yet been identified. Following the dismantling of the Bronx, the areas most affected have been Bosa, Ciudad Bolivar, Usme and San Cristobal, neighborhoods that are mainly located on the city's periphery. Groups located on the outskirts of the city supply the rest of Bogota with marijuana, cocaine, basuco (cocaine paste) and synthetic drugs. A 2017 report by Colombia's Ideas for Peace Foundation ( Fundacion Ideas para la Paz - FIP) found that at least 400 groups shared in microtrafficking around the capital, earning around $15 million a year. The Bronx became a lightning rod for authorities to strike at. But since then, microtrafficking groups in Bogota have learned their lesson. Bogota's microtrafficking market had begun fragmenting before the Bronx operation, according to the FIP report. Following the intervention, however, the ""ganchos"" from the Bronx were displaced and relocated to other parts of the city, such as Ciudad Bolivar, Suba and Kennedy. As new hotspots for drug sales have sprung up around the city, this has brought about a related rise in violence. While the overall murder rate in the Colombian capital has been steadily dropping, authorities have blamed the settling of scores between microtrafficking gangs for a number of murders and dismemberments that have occurred this year. The southern part of Bogota is particularly rife with microtrafficking, according to the Ombudsman's Office, as it serves as a strategic corridor for drugs and weapons entering the capital. Drugs primarily enter this part of the city via Autopista Sur and Avenida Villavicencio, which connect the capital to the southern part of Colombia, including the departments of Cauca, Meta and Guaviare. The southern districts of Ciudad Bolivar, Suba, Kennedy and Bosa, among others, have been fertile ground for extortion , the recruitment of minors and other criminal economies. For Colombia's Ombudsman, Carlos Alfonso Negret, the sophistication and scale of criminal activity in southern Bogota is such that the term microtrafficking is now no longer accurate. One example of such sophistication, according to the Ombudsman's Office and the FIP, is the decentralization of drug trafficking. Between entering the city and being sold to the consumer, drugs are passed down to smaller groups which themselves have networks across several streets, reducing the risks of any senior gang members being captured. In contrast to how these groups operate in rural areas, the Ombudsman's Office says that these groups don't have a defined hierarchy, don't wear uniforms or insignias, nor do they partake in open confrontations as occurs in other parts of the country. This allows group members to blend into everyday city life, but also requires them to work differently. As such, drugs pass through several sets of hands from the time they enter the city up until they are sold to consumers, permitting a high turnover of people involved in this criminal economy while reducing the associated risks for those heading the criminal enterprise."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Bolivian Senator Claims Persecution for Revealing Govt Drug Ties. A Bolivian senator says he is being persecuted for exposing the relationship between some officials in the Morales government and the drug trade. Is this an accurate report of corruption, or political maneuvering, or both? On May 28, Roger Pinto entered the Brazilian Embassy in La Paz, seeking political asylum, and his colleagues in the right-wing opposition Convergencia party called a press conference to explain why. Brandishing a larger-than-life cardboard cutout of the senator's head, complete with a gag and padlock over the mouth (see image, above), they read a statement in which Pinto said he had been left with no choice but to flee from government persecution. It said that there were currently some 20 legal cases open against him -- ""each one more outlandish than the last"" -- and that each time he reported corruption, the authorities opened a new proceeding against him. He claimed he had been the victim of harassment and constant death threats. President Evo Morales' Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) party responded by accusing Pinto of seeking asylum in order to avoid standing trial on corruption charges. Brazil's Foreign Ministry has said it is analyzing the request, and that Pinto can stay in the embassy while the decision is made. There have been conflicting media reports on whether asylum has been granted. Pinto's statement did not contain any information about who in the Morales government he is accusing of drug ties. To date, his most high-profile allegation was that former Interior Minister Sacha Llorenti and Vice President Alvaro Garcia knew about the drug trafficking activities of retired police general Rene Sanabria, who is currently in US prison convicted of drug trafficking. Sanabria was arrested in Panama in February 2011 and sent to the US to stand trial. In September he was sentenced to 15 years in prison for shipping several tons of cocaine to the US via Chile. The case raised questions about the reach of drug corruption in the Bolivian government. Sanabria was a powerful figure who served as the country's top anti-drug official until 2009, and at the time of his arrest he headed an intelligence office in the Interior Ministry. US prosectors said that he led a network of corrupt police officials. Three mid-level officers were arrested within days, while a police colonel* accused of being part of the ring is currently on the run. Sanabria is cooperating with US authorities, and has reportedly made statements that back Pinto's claims that elements of the Morales government are linked to drug traffickers. In May this year, Miami-based TV station Univision reported that Sanabria had sent the station a letter claiming that the Bolivian government was ""thwarting a comprehensive investigation into public officials involved in drug trafficking."" The imprisoned former general reportedly named Llorenti as being instrumental in the cover-up. Pinto responded by calling for the formation of a Congress commission to talk to Sanabria and investigate his claims. This followed another controversial report released by Univision in September 2011, the day before Sanabria was sentenced, which it claimed was based on Bolivian intelligence documents. According to Univision, the documents set out a picture of Bolivia as a ""narco-state"" where cartels from Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil carried out their business with official collusion. The intelligence reportedly named at least 40 people, including high-level police officials, lawyers, and business people who are facilitating the drug trade. The documents were not made public, however, and their authenticity has been questioned. According to Univision, the documents said that the Interior Ministry ignored the evidence of widespread corruption at the behest of Llorenti. Pinto supposedly asked that Llorenti be investigated for failing to examine Sanabria's links to drug trafficking, the TV station said. After the Univision report was released, Llorenti accused Pinto of having passed the documents to the station. Pinto denied this , saying that he had indeed handed the government a document accusing the then-minister, but that he had not given this to Univision. He retaliated by accusing Llorenti of trying to deny the fact that Bolivia was becoming a narco-state. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) also expressed concern over the Univision report, and said that the Bolivian authorities should investigate its allegations, noting that the drug trade is responsible for 3 to 5 percent of the country's GDP. In Bolivia, there have long been elements of the security forces involved in the drug trade, with the takeover of military dictator Luis Garcia Meza (1980-1981) dubbed the "" cocaine coup ,"" for his legacy of drug corruption in the military. Bolivia's police were thought to be less implicated in the trade, though the Sanabria case has thrown this into doubt. There has been a high rate of turnover at the head of Bolivia's police, with six losing their posts in the last six years amid various scandals. Most notable is Oscar Nina, who was fired in 2011 amid the fallout over the Sanabria case, and has reportedly been implicated by the jailed general in his illegal activities. Morales, however, has claimed that his enemies are using the Sanabria case to smear him, and there is no doubt some truth to this. However, this does not mean that police ties to trafficking do not exist. While Pinto may well be correct about the existence of high-level drug connections in the Morales government, his accusations also appear to have been politically motivated. Kathryn Ledebur of the Andean Information Network told InSight Crime that Pinto's claims have to be viewed as part of a far larger fight: ""It is clear that his assertion that all these charges are an attempt to silence his denunciations about trafficking are a gross oversimplification of a protracted political power struggle."" Aside from the political effects within Bolivia, the case could also have implications for Brazil's efforts to work with the Andean country to fight organized crime. In January, Brazil said it would donate four helicopters to its neighbor for use in anti-drug missions, on top of a previous pledge to provide drones for crop monitoring. The issue is particularly important for Brazil, which borders on the world's three main cocaine producers, and has seen cocaine and crack use rocket in recent years. As the WSJ points out , much of these narcotics come from, or via, Bolivia. In addition to this, Bolivia is on the point of returning some 400 vehicles stolen in Brazil, as Brazilian media have pointed out. If Brazil does grant asylum to Pinto, it could anger the Morales government and hurt these joint anti-crime initiatives at a crucial time for their development. It remains to be seen if Pinto can substantiate his claims. The revelation that such a high-level official as Sanabria was involved with the drug trade suggests that there may be more elements in the Bolivian government and security forces that are complicit. However, the country remains far from being the narco-state that Pinto describes. "	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Deploys Soldiers on Public Buses. Honduras will now station soldiers on public buses, a move that could prevent robberies and extortion in a transit system plagued by violence. Since September 27, the Honduran government has tasked soldiers with patrolling the bus systems of the capital city of Tegucigalpa and the troubled industrial hub of San Pedro Sula. Two soldiers will be stationed on public buses, which work particularly dangerous routes in both cities, in an attempt to deter gangs from demanding extortion payments from bus drivers. The Ministry of Security said the bus companies requested the army's presence, and that the soldiers would be limited to 20 bus routes in Tegucigalpa and 12 in San Pedro Sula. Lobo began using the country's military to boost security in 2011, when he stationed joint police and soldier patrols in high crime areas as part of ""Operation Lightning."" This is the second time that soldiers have been placed on Honduran buses, according to the Associated Press. The Honduras government's decision to station troops on its buses could bring security to a dangerous industry. As InSight Crime has reported , street gangs frequently extort bus companies in Central America because of the large amount of cash drivers generally have on hand. In Guatemala, for instance, bus extortion is a major problem. From 2005 to 2011 1,368 people were murdered on public transport in the country, 780 of whom were drivers. In response, Guatemala installed a digital payment system on some of its bus lines, a move that some sources say has dramatically reduced murder and violent crime on those buses since the cashless system began in 2007. Parts of Honduras and El Salvador have installed similar systems. In other countries considering a cashless system, like Colombia, bus drivers do not believe the lack of cash will stop extortion demands so much as cause them to shift their targets from the buses themselves to the company's offices."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Central America Pledges Support After Guatemala Massacre. Representatives of Central American countries stated their solidarity with Guatemala in an emergency meeting to discuss security in the region, following the massacre of 27 farm workers in northern Guatemala on Sunday. Guatemala's President Alvaro Colom called the meeting ""to analyze the recent acts of violence that have occured in the region [and] to take measures together,"" according his office, reports EFE. El Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes and Honduran President Porfirio Lobo attended the summit in Antigua, Guatemala, on Thursday, while Belize and Nicaragua sent representatives. After the meeting, the countries issued a joint statement expressing their solidarity with Colom over the massacre. They had reportedly discussed the links of organized crime to poverty and inequality, and agreed to establish cooperation mechanisms to share information and take joint action against threats. Colom announced that the countries had made progress on their strategic regional security plan. At a meeting earlier this month the members of the Central American Integration System (Sistema de la Integracion Centroamericana - SICA), a regional body, agreed to seek more than $950 million in aid to fund a plan to fight crime in the region. More details of this plan will be announced in a meeting to be held in Guatemala in June. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Ex-Presidents Brothers Face Drug Allegations*. Two brothers of two different, former Honduras presidents were implicated by the testimony of a leader of a prominent drug trafficking organization during the US drug trial of a former Honduran president's son, as allegations from this explosive case continue to dog the country's elites. Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, the former head of the so-called Cachiros, implicated the brothers of former President Porfirio Lobo and that of former President Manuel Zelaya, while testifying in a New York court on March 6, according to a court transcript obtained by El Heraldo. Rivera, himself a confessed drug trafficker, appeared last week as a key witness against former President Lobo's son, Fabio Lobo, who has pled guilty to drug trafficking charges in the United States. In addition to providing a damning testimony against the defendant, Rivera also spoke of the role of the former president's brother, Ramon Lobo, a.k.a. ""Moncho"" Lobo, as a political and financial go-between for the criminal group. According to Rivera, Lobo was among the intermediaries of a Cachiros' bribe for his younger brother, then-President Porfirio Lobo, in exchange for political and judicial protection. Ramon Lobo's home base is Tocoa, Colon, which was the epi-center of the Cachiros' criminal empire for a decade, and, as InSight Crime detailed in its investigation into the criminal group, attended the grand opening of one of the Rivera family's businesses before Devis and two of his brothers were accused of drug trafficking in the United States. During an interview with La Prensa published on March 10, Lobo categorically denied the allegations raised against him. Rivera's testimony also implicates the brother of another former president and President Lobo's predecessor, Manuel Zelaya. According to Rivera, Fabio Lobo suggested using the military base located next to the city of Aguacate, near the border with Nicaragua, to unload aerial drug shipments. But the scheme was abandoned because the military base's commander allegedly told Fabio Lobo that the airstrip had been used extensively by former President Zelaya's brother for drug trafficking, which had eventually brought too much attention to it. Although the name of the brother is not specified, it is likely that Rivera's testimony refers to Carlos Zelaya Rosales. On March 11, Zelaya publicly denied any links to drug trafficking activities, reported Tiempo. Neither Carlos Zelaya or Ramon Lobo have been charged with any criminal activities in Honduras or the United States. The explosive testimony has not been corroborated. Nonetheless, there appears to be a pattern in Honduras, which InSight Crime has noted in numerous previous investigations connecting the country's political elites to drug trafficking groups who, in return for political and judicial cover, as well as a hand in public works contracts , pay bribes in stacks of cash. In his testimony, for example, Rivera talked about how many inches tall the stack of cash was that was given to bribe then President Lobo at the president's residence. SEE ALSO : Honduras News and Profiles Unsubstantiated rumors and innuendo have long swirled around Carlos Zelaya. He was was accused of authorizing the landing in Honduras of a private jet owned by Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, only to have the accuser later retract and apologize. And a US embassy cable published by Wikileaks in 2010 indicated that the US ambassador considered Manuel Zelaya to be involved with organized crime. As for the Lobo family, beyond Fabio Lobo's admitted guilt, both the former president and his brothers have faced previous accusations of entertaining links with some of Honduras' most powerful underworld figures , including the Cachiros. *Correction: This article was modified from its original form to reflect that the official who had accused Zelaya had retracted his statements. It was an error of omission. InSight Crime regrets the mistake."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Rising Violence in Juarez, Mexico May Signal Return of Cartel War. Violence in Ciudad Juarez is on the rise. This year is on track to be the deadliest since 2012, signaling the possible renewal of warfare between the region's dominant criminal groups. Seven people were killed and one injured in an October 27 attack at a motel in the city of Chihuahua, a few hours south of Ciudad Juarez on the highway that links the two cities. According to eyewitnesses, four men entered the motel at around 5:45 pm wielding heavy caliber weapons, and opened fire on the victims. Afterward, the assailants fled north, stopping to change vehicles, according to El Diario. Chihuahua Attorney General Cesar Augusto Peniche said that both the victims and the perpetrators were members of criminal groups. The authorities have apprehended one of the individuals involved in the slaughter, according to Proceso. Additionally, ten other people were killed that day in various attacks in Juarez, reported Proceso. Juarez and the state of Chihuahua have seen rising levels of violence in recent months, raising speculation that the dark days of brutal killings that the city saw in between the years 2008 and 2012 could be making a comeback. Just in the month of October, there have been 90 homicides in Juarez, and 183 in the state of Chihuahua, according to Proceso. Mexico's army -- which many human rights activities have blamed, at least in part, for a spike in violence that began in 2008 -- was sent back onto the streets of Juarez in August this year. At the current pace, 2016 will be most violent year in Juarez since 2012, according to Mexican security analyst Alejandro Hope , who also noted that violence is not confined to Juarez, and that murders have been on the rise around the state of Chihuahua. The level of brutality and style of the killings, notes Hope, are reminiscent of those seen during the 2008 to 2012 war between the Juarez and Sinaloa Cartels. The notion that the conflict between the two groups could be revived was lent credence via an interview the newspaper El Universal recently conducted with ""Jorge"", a leader of La Linea (The Line), the enforcement wing of the Juarez Cartel. Jorge said that the latest rise in homicides were just the beginning. According to him, ""war"" is returning to Juarez and the worst is yet to come. Gustavo Fondevila, a security expert, told InSight Crime that it is likely that the possible extradition to the United States of Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo Guzman has weakened the crime group and disrupted its control in Juarez. When criminal groups contest strategically important territories -- like Juarez, which is a major transshipment point for drugs headed to the United States -- violence tends to increase, Fondevila said."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Conflicting Crime Stats Call Mexico Security Narrative into Question. Mexico's National Citizen Observatory has identified major discrepancies in crime figures reported by the country's two official statistics sources, casting doubt on the validity of current data pointing to a large drop in homicides. After analyzing 2013 data reported by Mexico's statistical agency (INEGI) and the Secretary General of National Public Safety (SESNSP), the National Citizen Observatory (ONC) found large differences that it said indicated state prosecutor's offices were using inconsistent systems to collect and compile information on crimes ( pdf ). In some cases, the information reported by INEGI and the SESNSP showed contradictory crime trends in the same state. In Puebla, for example, INEGI reported a 17 percent increase in homicides between 2012 and 2013, whereas SESNSP figures showed a nearly 26 percent decrease in the state over the same period. ""We don't have reliable information to produce a diagnostic of the violence in our country,"" ONC Director Francisco Rivas stated. President Enrique Pena Nieto has worked to highlight Mexico's security successes, recently claiming the murder rate during the first six months of 2014 had dropped 27 percent from the same period in 2012. It remains unclear where he sourced his information from, and the ONC report now raises the question of how reliable that source's figures may have been. While the ONC attributes the differences between INEGI and SESNSP figures to variations in methodology, it is possible political calculations are also part of the equation. All too often, crime statistics are manipulated by governments, who want to control information to fit the security narrative they wish to present. Venezuela has a particular reputation for doctoring its homicide figures and Honduras' recent claims of dropping murders followed a drastic change in the way homicides were officially counted. For these reasons, as well as faulty methodologies, crime statistics generally need to be viewed critically. Regardless of how much Mexico's homicide rate has or has not actually decreased, Pena Nieto appears to be losing the statistical battle when it comes to his own approval ratings. May polls showed that around half of the population disapproved of the president ( pdf ). What's more, the Mexican public appears to have a generally worsening perception of security, which may be linked to the fact that while murders have apparently dropped, crimes like kidnapping have continued to rise."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Mexico Narco-Culture Takes an Ugly Turn in Lingerie. Images of Mexican authorities humiliating suspected cartel members have been circulated on social media and picked up by some US media sites to the apparent delight of right-leaning press and violence-addled citizen journalists. As reported by Breitbart News , the videos and photographs of Mexican arrestees being subjected to embarrassing and abusive treatment include male suspects forced to wear women's underwear and a female suspect with a plastic bag over her head. According to the reports, the incidents are largely the work of a single marine commander, whom they identify as Erick Morales Guevara. In 2015 Morales Guevara was deployed in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas, first in the border city of Reynosa and later in the beach town of Tampico. In both towns, he and his subordinates took aim at local leadership of the Gulf Cartel, and in turn inspired significant rancor from the organization. Following allegations of corruption, he moved on to Michoacan, where he currently is deployed. While reaction from social media consumers was divided, Breitbart's reporting, which was carried out by ""citizen journalists"" from the northern states of Tamaulipas and Coahuila, was essentially positive: Breitbart Texas spoke with various top officials with the Mexican Navy to learn about the exploits of Morales Guevara, a marine that will sometimes bend the rules but will get the job done While the persons consulted for this article acknowledge that [Morales Guevara's] methods are unorthodox, and some not exactly legal, the results speak for themselves. Morales' team has been behind a series of important arrests along with cash, drug and weapon seizures, that severely impaired the operations of drug cartels, the sources said. Such behavior by arresting officers is not entirely uncommon. High-profile Mexican suspects are typically paraded before the camera when taken into custody, and their faces occasionally show bruises. And the positive reaction from Breitbart and others on social media shows that there is clearly an appetite for public denigration of organized crime figures. To a certain extent, this desire for criminals' degradation is understandable. For decades, Mexico's largest criminal groups have made a mockery of the nation's public institutions, intimidating everyone from government agents to reporters to teachers. The same groups have often attacked civilians with total impunity. For anyone with an interest in the integrity of Mexico's democratic society, this longstanding state of affairs is profoundly frustrating, even humiliating, and seeing the figures responsible for it similarly humiliated helps alleviate the sense of impotence. But the natural desire for turnabout should not be confused with policies that will address the causes of insecurity. On the contrary, this overly macho approach, based on the idea that the strongest side inevitably wins, is better suited to a cheap action movie than real life. Mexico's problems demand much more than this narrow, misguided conception of strength: they require intellectual creativity, patience, and willpower. While there is a substantial difference between dressing a suspect up in women's underwear and murdering him, dehumanizing suspected criminals is a slippery slope that can lead to more consequential abuses. In a democracy, respect for human rights should be upheld even when dealing with the nation's most dangerous criminals. For years, Mexico has struggled to prevent abuses in its conduct of security operations. Cases like the Ayotzinapa student disappearances and the Tlatlaya massacre have gravely undermined the current government's international standing and its popular support within Mexico. Even before the Enrique Pena Nieto administration came to power, NGOs like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch had provided detailed reports on all manner of violations by security officials in Mexico, from rape and torture to disappearances and extrajudicial killings. While there is a substantial difference between dressing a suspect up in women's underwear and murdering him, dehumanizing suspected criminals is a slippery slope that can lead to more consequential abuses. Regardless of where a given action lies on that slope, the government's pattern of abuses reflects a deep-seated defect that should be resisted in all its forms. Even beyond the issue of human rights abuses, this willingness to dehumanize suspects is counterproductive. In the short term, it can interfere with authorities' ability to build source networks, and presumably complicates efforts to interrogate arrestees. It feeds into the abusive policies -- mass arrests and widespread pretrial jailing -that have contributed to overcrowding in Mexico's jails. In the long run, this dehumanization creates enduring suspicions of police bodies among the very communities whose cooperation is most needed. There is some surface logic to the argument that abusing arrestees has a powerful propaganda value. Demonstrating that gangsters are not invulnerable supermen has the potential to erode public fear of the cartels, making it more difficult for them to operate. But, apart from the question of legality, there is no real evidence supporting the effectiveness of human rights abuses as a law enforcement tool. Rather than being an unorthodox way of undermining gangland mystique, it is a needless concession to collective fear and anger. It is a reflection of the worst human impulses that should be condemned rather than celebrated."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Trademarking El Chapo in Mexico. Revelations that family members of notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman have trademarked his name for commercial use have sparked a scandal in Mexico and raised questions over who, if anyone, should benefit from a criminal's ""brand name."" In 2010 and 2011 Mexico's Industrial Property Institute (IMPI by its Spanish initials) approved 24 trademark requests from El Chapo's daughter Alejandrina Gisselle Guzman Salazar and two women listed as his wives. The approvals granted the trio rights to produce products such as clothes, jewelry and toys bearing ""El Chapo"" and other variations of the criminal alias, Milenio has uncovered. The recently recaptured El Chapo is a leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, Mexico's most powerful drug trafficking network and an organization linked to thousands of deaths, and the discovery of IMPI's trademark approvals has become a minor scandal, with local and international media picking up the story. Mexico's Economic Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal was quick to point out that IMPI had approved the requests during the previous administration of Felipe Calderon, not current President Enrique Pena Nieto. According to a separate Milenio article, IMPI has received requests to trademark numerous other names associated with Mexican organized crime, but has generally rejected them. Organized crime-themed products and entertainment is nothing new. "" Narcocorridos "" or folk songs immortalizing cartel bosses and the criminal lifestyle, for example, are popular throughout Mexico and Central America. However, El Chapo is arguably the only drug trafficker since Colombia's Pablo Escobar to build up such international recognition and infamy that his image has evolved into a marketable brand. Already, in the United States, shoppers have been able to dress in the El Chapo prison break costume for Halloween, while sales of paisley blue shirts went up after El Chapo was photographed in one next to actor Sean Penn. What many find distasteful is that El Chapo's relatives could profit from a brand built on the violence and criminality that have caused so much harm in Mexico. In Colombia a similar case arose when the family of Pablo Escobar were denied the right to trademark his name. However, while it may not be controversial to deny relatives the right to benefit from criminal misdeeds, third parties regular capitalize on these markets without much criticism -- the popularity of Netflix series "" Narcos "" and movies such as "" Sicario "" are evidence of that. And after El Chapo's recent recapture and meeting with Sean Penn, a movie based on his life seems all but inevitable."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Chinese Smugglers Driving Up Jaguar Killings in Bolivia. The trafficking of jaguar teeth from Bolivia's natural parks to China has sparked worries that Asian smugglers are boosting this illegal trade. Between 2014 and 2016, 800 jaguar teeth have been seized by Bolivian authorities, suggesting that around 200 animals have been killed, reported the Bolivian Environment Forum (Foro Boliviano sobre Medio Ambiente - FOBOMADE). The teeth were reportedly intended to be smuggled to China. FOBOMADE reports that the current number of killed jaguars threatens to reach levels comparable to the 1980s, when hunting was still legal. This comes despite a 30-year campaign to stop the practice in protected forest areas. The majority of jaguar teeth seizures have been made in the neighboring Madidi and Pilon Lajas natural reserves, said Teresa Perez, director of the Environment Ministry's Biodiversity and Protected Areas Office. People working to protect the jaguars have reported that some Chinese nationals are responsible for the poaching. ""When tourism was growing and raising people's awareness regarding laws and preservation, there were very few cases"" of jaguar hunting, activist Daniel Manzaneda said. ""But since the Chinese came they've been killing them by the dozen, as well as ocelots, snakes and who knows what other species."" In May 2016, a Chinese citizen allegedly bought a radio announcement in Rurrenabaque municipality -- near Madidi -- in which he offered to buy jaguar teeth for $100 apiece. He was later arrested and six teeth were seized. Another Chinese citizen in Rurrenabaque was found with 300 jaguar teeth in 2014, although he is not currently behind bars. These nature reserves are vast and largely unprotected. While in 1997 there were 25 forest rangers in the Pilon Lajas and Madidi reserves, today there are only 12 covering the 40,000-hectare expanse, and they have to make do with poor salaries and a lack of resources. One of the detected wildlife trafficking routes from Madidi passes through the town of Ixiamas on its way to Peru. ""Past Ixiamas it's practically no man's land,"" a local police officer said. ""Brazilian mafiosos and Peruvians enter and traffic as they please. Now we're also seeing Chinese people, I don't know if they're competition or if they have agreements."" According to Perez, nine Chinese citizens and two Bolivians are currently being prosecuted for jaguar trafficking. In January, the Environment Ministry reported that 60 wildlife trafficking cases have been opened in the past 10 years. Jaguar trafficking in Bolivia could be evidence that Chinese organized crime is further spreading its tentacles into wildlife trafficking in Latin America. To be sure, Chinese demand for exotic food and other goods is a driving force behind what is now one of the world's largest criminal economies. Jaguar teeth are of great value in traditional Asian medicine. Various Latin American countries feed the Chinese black market, including Mexico, Peru and Ecuador with their offerings of prohibited seafood items. What's more, there are signs that the presence of Chinese mafias is growing in the region. Authorities in Bolivia and other South American countries have detected Chinese human trafficking networks. And as the economic and political ties between China and Latin America deepen, it's possible that the Chinese criminal groups in the region will strengthen ties to their homeland. It is difficult to understand the true reach of Chinese mafias in Latin America, however, as the modus operandi of these groups is notably low-key."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Peace Deal Signed in Colombia as Threat of FARC Fragmentation Looms Large. Colombia's government and rebel group the FARC have signed a revised peace deal, as the two sides race to reduce the chances of more guerrilla fighters falling outside of the planned demobilization process. President Juan Manuel Santos and commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), Rodrigo Londono Echeverry, alias ""Timochenko,"" signed a new peace deal on the morning of November 24 in the Colombian capital of Bogota. The signing comes seven weeks after voters rejected an initial agreement between the two sides. Congress will reportedly hold a vote for its approval this coming Tuesday. If the agreement is approved, the legislative body will have to pass numerous laws attached to the deal before it can be implemented. It remains to be seen if this will be done via a ""fast-track"" process by which the laws would be passed by a simple yes/no vote on each of its provisions. The other option would to open up the provisions for debate, which could take several months. SEE ALSO : Coverage of FARC Peace The two sides received hundreds of proposals to modify the deal from the political opposition. The main sticking points were that FARC members would face alternatives to prison time, and that the former guerrillas would be guaranteed 10 seats in congress for two terms. Another delicate issue is that under the initial deal, drug trafficking was considered a political crime that could be pardoned. But the new agreement has not made many substantial changes in these areas, and the amendments are considered insufficient by the political opposition spearheaded by former President Alvaro Uribe and his Democratic Center party. The Colombian government and FARC leadership are keenly aware that they are in a race against the clock. FARC fighters who had already begun preparations to demobilize have been stuck in a precarious limbo ever since the initial peace deal was voted down in early October. This sense of urgency is reflected in the quick turnaround between the rejection of the first agreement and the signing of the second. ""We have to act,"" Santos said during the signing ceremony. ""We have no time to lose."" As more time passes, it becomes increasingly likely that FARC elements abandon the peace process altogether and return to the financial security of their criminal activities, most notably the overseeing of cocaine production and extortion. Dissidents from the FARC's 1st Front, which has deep links to the illicit drug trade, have already announced their intention to not demobilize. Colombian security forces recently told InSight Crime that the rate of dissidence within FARC ranks could be as high as 49 percent. To compare, past demobilization processes with the Popular Liberation Army (Ejercito Popular de Liberacion - EPL) rebels and the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC) saw a non-adherence rate of around 20 percent. In both cases, splinter groups consolidated into powerful criminal factions that remain heavily involved in the drug trade, providing a worrying precedent that could be surpassed in the case of the FARC."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Theft of Babies Rising Again in Guatemala. Cases of stolen Guatemalan babies are on the rise again, says an independent child welfare organization in that country, indicating a possible resurgence of illegal adoptions in that Central American country. One recent case -- documented in a report by the Mexican newspaper El Universal -- involved a couple that attempted to sell a Guatemalan baby for $6,000, according to Leonel Dubon, director of the Guatemalan Child Refuge Center. Dubon said the case ""was not isolated"" and added that the commercialization of children was returning to levels ""like those in the worst part of the 1990s,"" with babies stolen from their mothers' arms in hospitals. In 2013, there have been at least 12 cases of stolen babies in Guatemala, according to El Universal, something which Dubon attributes both to high levels of impunity and to the bureaucratic system for legal adoptions, which leads prospective parents to look for easier adoption routes. According to statistics from the center, 1,700 of the total number of Guatemalan children reported ""missing"" in 2012, continued missing as of March 2013. The illegal adoption industry in Guatemala, detailed most recently in a book by investigative journalist and photographer Erin Siegal , operates at various levels, including the falsification of documents, fake DNA test results, and kidnapping. Before Guatemala ratified an international convention regarding adoption standards in 2007, the country was second in the world as a source of adoptions after China, with 97 percent of these children adopted by United States families in 2006. Between 2005 and 2008, the annual average number of minors stolen fluctuated from 351 to 413, with these children often sold for between $15,000 and $50,000, according to El Universal. US adoption agencies on the receiving end are not required to ascertain how the children have been adopted, just that they meet the standards of being legally adoptable in their home country, which can happen in a variety of illegal ways, said Siegal in an interview with Crime Report in 2011. Illegal adoptions are a problem in other countries in the region as well. A child trafficking ring that planned to smuggle babies to Irish couples was dismantled in Mexico in 2012, and in March, Brazilian judges were accused of complicity in an illegal adoption ring."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Mexico Migrant Kidnappings on the Rise?Migration activists in Mexico are warning about a growth in the number of kidnappings of migrants by crime groups, and they blame the government's policies for exacerbating the situation. Tomas Gonzalez, a priest who runs a migrant shelter in the state of Tabasco, recently told La Opinion that he had encountered several groups of migrants in the past few months who claimed that they had been kidnapped and forced to pay a ransom in order to secure their release. ""What we are seeing is again the neglect of the authorities on the issue of abduction of migrants,"" Gonzalez said. According to Ruben Figueroa, an activist with the Mesoamerican Migrant Movement (Movimiento Migrante Mesoamericano - M3), the government is not simply ignoring the problem; it is contributing to it. ""The new routes derived from the operations of the National Migration Institute (Instituto Nacional de Migracion -- INM) aimed at stopping migrants cause them to transit through zones controlled by organized crime,"" putting them at risk for extortion, Figueroa said. Figueroa added that it is ""impossible"" to determine the true scope of the kidnapping problem, because government statistics do not distinguish between operations that free kidnapping victims and those that result in detentions of undocumented migrants. Nevertheless, there appears to be broad agreement that migrant kidnapping is a major issue. For instance, the Honduran consul in the Mexican state of Veracruz, Raul Otoniel, told La Opinion that kidnapping ""is one of the principal problems of migration right now."" Despite the problems with obtaining accurate data, there are a number of reasons to believe anecdotal reports like those cited above represent a larger trend. For one, the official data that is available suggests a huge increase in migrant kidnappings in recent years, which is likely related to the growing number of migrants transiting Mexico as they flee crime and violence in Central America. Echoing the point made by M3's Figueroa, journalists and other researchers have also found that Mexico's immigration crackdown has done little to stem the flow of migrants while forcing them to use dangerous routes often controlled by criminal groups. This has put migrants at heightened risk for nearly every conceivable form of exploitation and abuse including murder , rape , extortion -- and, of course, kidnapping. And even migrants who reach the United States are not necessarily safe from criminal actors. In one case that recently saw a human smuggler sentenced to three terms of life in prison, the defendant admitted to holding undocumented migrants hostage in stash houses in Texas."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
How Californias Legalization of Marijuana Impacts Mexicos Cartels. US voters in three states -- including California -- have approved the legalization of recreational marijuana, a decision that is likely to accelerate the trend of Mexican criminal organizations shifting production to other illicit drugs, particularly heroin. Voters chose to legalize the use of recreational marijuana in California, Massachusetts and Nevada during the November 8 elections, and the drug will also be available for medicinal purposes in three additional states, reported the New York Times. The percentage of US citizens living in states with recreational marijuana legislation rose from five to 20 percent, according to the Times. The addition of California to the list of states that have now legalized marijuana is of particular significance. California is the most populous US state, and its economy ranks as the fifth largest in the world. A 2015 study found that California accounted for 49 percent of the US marijuana market in 2014, and that it is worth an estimated $1.3 billion, according to The Huffington Post. The legalization of marijuana in California is sure to have a big impact on criminal groups south of the border, as they continue to respond to the changes in supply and demand for illicit drugs in the United States. The production of opium poppy, the raw ingredient used to make heroin, has been growing in Mexico as a result of a boom in the US market for the drug, which has been linked to the overprescription of legal medical opioids. Studies have estimated that poppy cultivation could now amount to 40 percent more than that of marijuana in Mexico. This shift has been accelerated by the legalization of marijuana in a growing number of US states, which has led to a decrease in demand for black-market marijuana smuggled in from Mexico. These criminal organizations are increasingly switching to poppy in order to curb the financial losses incurred by the fall in marijuana profits. With the number of potential consumers in the legal US marijuana market quadrupling overnight, Mexican smuggling groups will be further incentivized to make the transition to heroin and other illicit drugs such as methamphetamine .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Paraguays Lonely Anti-Drug Prosecutor. The department of Amambay in Paraguay only has one prosecutor currently working on drug cases, raising questions about the ability of authorities to effectively prosecute these crimes in a key transit point for cocaine and marijuana trafficking in the Southern Cone. Valeriana Ferreira has been Amambay's only prosecutor assigned to drug cases after her colleague took a three-month maternity leave, according to ABC Color. The Attorney General's Office has made no motion towards appointing an interim prosecutor in the meantime, or assigning more staff in a region considered a major hub for organized crime , the newspaper reported. Even if Ferreira's colleague were still on duty, sources cited by ABC Color say the national police and the SENAD, Paraguay's anti-drug agency, would still have no confidence in the Amambay prosecutor's office. When asked about a development in a recent case against two local politicians allegedly linked to drug trafficking, Ferreira reportedly told an ABC reporter, ""I already left the office and don't remember what happened."" An unidentified source told ABC Color that Ferreira is incompetent, and that the source suspected she may be collaborating with criminal interests. Despite the flimsiness of the claim that Ferreira is on the take -- based on suspicions from one anonymous source -- it is undeniable that criminal organizations have significantly infiltrated Amambay's local government. In one recent illustrative case, corrupt police reportedly returned 252 kilograms of seized cocaine to a local drug kingpin. Several police officers were arrested, and the investigation was eventually widened to include the two Amambay councilmen that Ferreira is tasked with prosecuting. It is also undeniable that when drug cases involving powerful local interests flow through one office with only two prosecutors, the opportunities and pressures for corruption are much higher. While police , politicians , and military officers have been implicated in a variety of corruption cases in Paraguay, the country's judicial system has proven similarly susceptible. In 2013, a network of judges, prosecutors, and coroners were accused of giving lenient sentences to drug traffickers in 80 cases in the Triple Frontier region, south of Amambay."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexicos Casino Crackdown Only Scratches the Surface. Mexico has begun to crack down on its illegal gambling industry following scores of deaths in a casino arson attack, but evidence suggests that problem goes deep, and will take more than the closing of a few gaming houses. Following the firebombing of an illegal Monterrey casino which killed at least 52 people, the federal government has responded swiftly, investigating and shutting down unlicensed casinos throughout the country. According to the Interior Ministry, as of October 3 authorities had opened investigations into 69 gaming houses in Mexico, closing 19 for lacking the proper documentation. In the state of Nuevo Leon -- of which Monterrey is the capital -- state legislators have been even more severe on the industry. On October 19, the northern state's Chamber of Deputies voted unanimously to place a moratorium on the issuance of casino licenses. As InSight Crime has reported, Mexico's gambling industry (both licensed and non-licensed) is permeated by organized crime. Much of this has to do with the fact that casinos offer an useful outlet for money laundering. Due to the large inflows of cash that gambling brings, and the difficulties of monitoring wins and losses, it is relatively easy to use casinos to disguise the source of illicit funds. At least partly because of its utility to criminal groups, the industry has witnessed tremendous growth in the past few years. According to Proceso magazine , the number of gaming houses in Mexico has jumped from 198 to 790 since President Felipe Calderon took office in 2006, and the magazine estimates that many are unlicensed. The business also breeds a cutthroat environment, in which casino owners have been known to order hits on their rivals in order to maintain their hold on the market. Considering the extent of criminal involvement in the industry, the recent crackdown is a positive step. However, the problems associated with illegal casinos go much deeper than the businesses themselves. In the wake of the August 25 casino fire, blame for the incident focused on the Zetas, who allegedly carried out the attack. After the fire, authorities claimed that the casino was likely targeted because it lacked a proper gaming license, and that the Zetas were presumably offering ""protection"" from federal regulatory officials. While this may be the case, it ignores the role that other, more institutional actors play in this process. An illustration of this occurred several days after the incident, when Grupo Reforma published a video showing the brother of the mayor of Monterrey, Fernando Larrazabal, entering a different Monterrey casino and accepting a stack of bills disguised in a cell phone box from someone who appeared to be a manager. When asked about the affair, Larrazabal seemed taken aback, and claimed that the money was for ""cheese"" and other goods he had sold to the casino. Since then the mayor has come under increasing suspicion from public prosecutors, and officials from his National Action Party (PAN) have called for him to step down, but to no avail.

"17 Dead in Guatemala Prison Violence. At least 17 people were killed in fights inside a Guatemala prison, taking violence levels to new heights within a penitentiary system plagued by overcrowding, gangs and corruption. Fighting broke out inside the Granja Penal Canada prison on the afternoon of November 29 and continued for several hours until approximately 2,000 police were deployed to retake the prison, reported AFP. Of the 17 prisoners left dead in the violence, seven were decapitated, reported various news sources. The reasons for the violence remain unconfirmed, but preliminary reports suggest the killings were carried out by common criminals, known in Guatemala as ""paisas,"" against gang members, known as ""cholos."" Family members of prisoners and investigators speaking to elPeriodico said the attack was retaliation for the gangs' extortion schemes, which included levying charges on visitors entering the prison, and an attempt to break the gang members' control of the prison. Other hypotheses being touted include intra-gang fighting and an escape attempt, reported Prensa Libre. As in much of the region, conditions in most of Guatemala's prisons are atrocious, largely because of intense overcrowding. Overall, the country's prison system has an occupancy rate of 270.6 percent, while in Granja Penal Canada, there are over 3,000 prisoners in a space built for just 600. While such issues create fertile conditions for prison violence, the situation is exacerbated by the presence of the ""mara"" street gangs, the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Barrio 18. These gangs often seek to take control of the lucrative business opportunities found within the prison economy, including activities such as extortion and drug sales. If the preliminary reports are correct and the killings were an attempt by common prisoners to break the gangs' control, then the massacre echoes previous violence in the Guatemalan prison system, in particular an incident in 2008 when inmates murdered seven gang members, decapitated them and placed their heads on stakes. According to the BBC, the Granja Penal Canada massacre raises the total number of Guatemala prison deaths in 2015 to 39, exceeding the previous record set in 2005. That year, the MS13 launched a series of confrontations , after abandoning their policy of non-aggression with their rivals behind prison walls."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Head of Copycat MS13 Offshoot Captured in Peru. The capture of the head of Peru's own ""Mara Salvatrucha"" is likely an example of Central America's MS13 inspiring similar -- but probably unconnected -- criminal operations far from home. Peruvian authorities have arrested a man described as the head of the ""Mara Salvatrucha Peru"" or ""MSX3,"" an acronym apparently also used to denote the MS13, La Republica reported. Police arrested Balbin Antonio Castillo Nole during a routine search in a Lima district on August 2, El Comercio reported. The subject is reportedly wanted for drug trafficking, kidnapping, extortion, attempted homicide, and theft. Castillo had been on the run since 2012, when he was arrested in his home town, the port city of Callao, under similar accusations. It is not known how, if or why he was released, according to local media. Past press reports suggest that the MSX3's activities focused on collecting extortion, dealing drugs in their neighborhoods and running contract hitman networks. Members also brandish tattoos similar to those used by Central American gangs. While such news does inspire headlines, the presence of MS13 branches as far south as Peru is far from a given. As InSight Crime has noted in the past , the ability of the MS13 -- whose strongest base is in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala -- to expand transnationally is, for now, weak. Even proof of coordination between the gangs based in these neighboring countries has been limited. While there are definite parallels between Peru's own Mara offshoot and the MS13, it is unlikely that they work together. Indeed, Peruvian authorities have described local Mara factions as "" inspired "" by, or "" imitators "" of, Central America's gangs. Claims of Mara spinoffs have been made even further south, in Argentina. Last year, authorities arrested Richard Castillo Salazar -- originally from the same Peruvian town as Castillo -- in Buenos Aires. Salazar claimed to be the ""the head of the Mara Salvatrucha."" In other cases, the arrests of Central American MS13 members abroad has sparked concerns of expansion, although there has been little evidence that their foreign presence was more than incidental. If anything, the emergence of criminal groups using the Mara brand name across the continent -- even as far as Europe -- speaks to the looser nature of today's organized criminal groups and the increasing fragmentation of the traditional crime cartels. Some of Latin America's most powerful syndicates, such as Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and Colombia's Urabenos, have evolved into franchise-style organizations. These franchises give their name to a plethora of smaller groups who use the brand to incite fear and operate, while being only loosely affiliated to the organization's leadership, if at all. A trend of bottom-up rather than top-down growth has also emerged, with street gangs gradually becoming more sophisticated and powerful as old school criminal structures weaken."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Colombia Home to Over 15 Percent of Worlds Internally Displaced Population. An estimated 12 percent of Colombia's population has been displaced as a result of violence perpetrated by guerrilla groups and criminal organizations, making it the country with the second highest number of internally displaced people in the world after Syria. A new report from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) and the Norwegian Refugee Council found that of the roughly seven million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Latin America, over six million reside in Colombia. In total, Colombia is home to 15.8 percent of the world's internally displaced population. A significant number of people have also been forced to relocate in El Salvador, Mexico, and Guatemala -- between 240,000 and 290,000 in each of these three countries, according to the report. Meanwhile, Honduras had the smallest number of IDPs of the Latin American countries surveyed by the IDMC -- 29,400 -- significantly lower than its neighbors in the crime-racked Northern Triangle region. Weighted by population, the displacement figures in Mexico and Honduras are much lower than those in Colombia, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The report attributed Colombia's widespread internal displacement to the country's ongoing armed conflict involving guerrilla groups the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). However, criminal organizations operating along the country's Pacific Coast, which is home to important drug and arms trafficking routes , have also forced people to flee from their homes in recent years. In Mexico and Central America, the report found that most of the displacements were due to drug trafficking related violence and gang activity. While the IDMC's report paints a stark picture of the total number of displaced people in Latin America, these figures likely fall short of the full magnitude of the problem. Internal displacement is typically one of the least visible consequences of violence, and some countries do not keep accurate counts of the number of victims. In Mexico, for example, the government does not have an official figure on the number of people who have fled drug war related violence, but the think tank Parametria estimates that as many as 1.65 million people were forced to leave their homes between 2006 and 2011. The IDMC was also only able to look at six countries in the region, and noted that the availability of data was a major problem. The report does not include Brazil, for example, where displacement is a largely overlooked issue caused by a variety of factors including gangs, militias, and state security forces. The report also noted that investigators were unable to find accurate 2014 displacement numbers for Honduras, which could explain the country's surprisingly low number of reported IDPs. Honduras has one of the region's highest homicide rates , and faces similar issues related to gang violence and drug trafficking as its Northern Triangle neighbors El Salvador and Guatemala, which both had nearly 10 times as many IDPs.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia to Invest Unprecedented $2.3 Billion in Citizen Security. The Colombian government plans to invest a total of $2.3 billion in citizen security for the 2012 to 2015 period, highlighting how localized criminal operations are gaining ground on international drug trafficking as the country's primary security threat. President Juan Manuel Santos called the funding, which amounts to 2.4% of the country's 2013 national budget , an "" unprecedented investment "" aimed at improving citizen security. The scheme -- which will be managed by both the national government and 24 municipal governments -- includes the creation of integrated security plans for the participating municipalities and the addition of 25,000 police to the national force, of which 10,000 have already joined. The president said efforts so far have resulted in a 19 percent reduction in violent deaths and the reduction of robbery by 38 percent for residences, 25 percent for shops, 16 percent for vehicles and 10 percent for individuals, reported El Colombiano. Also included in the budget is an ongoing initiative targeting micro-trafficking -- street level drug dealing -- as well as a new offensive announced by Santos to tackle contraband smuggling, which he said would see a "" frontal assault "" targeting groups involved in the trade and the legitimate businesses that support it. Santos' budget announcement followed shortly after the murder of a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in Bogota by assailants believed to have been attempting an express kidnapping. The murder, thought to be connected to a local criminal network of thieves, put the issue of citizen security front and center. Earlier in June, Colombia's national police chief announced police took down 786 criminal gangs in 2012 and stated that ongoing operations to counter micro-trafficking have been 92 percent effective thus far. Though these numbers were framed as successes, they also highlight the proliferation of small-scale organized criminal activity in Colombia, which has been fuelled by the fragmentation of larger criminal organizations. Small criminal networks often do not operate in isolation. In June, one Colombian official called contraband trafficking a "" national security phenomenon "" after contraband networks believed to launder money for the FARC were linked to the murder of an official from the country's tax and customs police (DIAN). Micro-traffickers similarly have connections with larger criminal groups such as the Urabenos , who serve as wholesalers or take a cut of profits."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Mexicos 44 Tn Marijuana Bust Points to Ongoing Use of Land Routes. Authorities in Tijuana, Mexico have seized 44 tons of marijuana, indicating that despite an increased reliance on Caribbean and Pacific drug routes traffickers continue to smuggle large quantities overland. Acting on a federal warrant, the Mexican military and local police raided a warehouse in Tijuana on May 1, reported USA Today. They discovered around 4,000 packets of marijuana with an estimated US street value of $50 million. No arrests were made during the raid. This seizure comes just six months after the discovery of a sophisticated drug smuggling tunnel running between Tijuana and San Diego, California. Seven other similar tunnels and large quantities of marijuana have also been discovered in San Diego since 2006. Tijuana's proximity to San Diego makes it a strategic crossing point for drugs, and the largest quantity of marijuana ever seized in Mexico -- close to 150 tons -- was discovered in that city in 2010. While no arrests have been made, the most recent seizure is likely linked to the Sinaloa Cartel, which has controlled most of Tijuana's drug trade since winning a bloody turf war against the Arellano Felix Organization, also known as the Tijuana Cartel. Although drug traffickers are increasingly relying on maritime Caribbean and Pacific coast routes , this seizure highlights the continued importance of overland routes to criminal organizations. The warehouse was located in a neighborhood relatively far inland, indicating that the marijuana was most likely waiting to cross the land border, rather than be taken out to cross at sea. The seizure additionally highlights the continued importance of marijuana as a source of revenue to drug traffickers. Although cocaine and methampthetamine garner much more attention, a former senior policy advisor at the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) estimated in 2012 that marijuana sales made up 17 percent of US revenue for Mexican cartels. According to a US Justice Department report ( pdf ), potential marijuana production in Mexico increased by 113 percent between 2005 and 2010, a phenomenon attributed to decreased crop eradication.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Police Vendetta Ends Myth of Venezuela Crime Boss. Venezuelan authorities celebrated the death of the country's most wanted criminal at the hands of law enforcement this month but the killing of the gang leader known as El Picure appears to be more the result of a police vendetta than a concerted effort to rein in organized crime. On May 3, commandos of the Bolivarian National Guard (Guardia Nacional Bolivariana - GNB) tracked one of Venezuela's most notorious criminals to a house in the town of El Sombrero in the central state of Guarico. After a gunfight that claimed the lives of nine alleged gang members and one GNB, the agents posed for a picture with the body of the gang boss in the style of the famous image of the Colombian commandos that took down Pablo Escobar in 1993. ""El Picure is dead. The myth is finished!"" they announced via their internal communications. The head of the GNB and the minister of interior, justice and peace congratulated the troopers who participated in the assault and vowed to continue their crusade against the violent criminal bands that they call ""paramilitaries."" But more than a symbol of official triumph, El Picure's death is likely to be remembered as an enduring symbol of police inefficiency. Jose Tovar Colina was leader of one of Venezuela's biggest, most well established and violent gangs, called the Tren del Llano, or Train of the Plain. He went by the alias El Picure, the Venezuelan name for a large rodent common to much of Latin America. Just 27 years old, El Picure had managed to stay a step ahead of the authorities for eight years, slipping away from numerous operations to capture him. His gang first appeared on the national public radar in 2013, when they spectacularly confronted police in the town of Barbacoas, 250 kilometers southeast of the capital, Caracas. It was not the first time members of the band had exchanged gunfire with the authorities. But on this occasion they were armed with assault rifles, and after repelling a police raid they followed the officers back and mounted an attack against the police station. Members of the gang blocked the streets throughout the town and threatened to blow up any vehicle that moved with an antitank weapon. ""El Picure is dead. The myth is finished!"" announced the soldiers Following the incident, the judicial police (CICPC) created a file on the gang and its principal members. The GNB's anti-extortion and kidnapping unit and the National Police also launched investigations. According to these investigations, El Picure's gang's main activities were car thefts and extortion. They had 25 members when the CICPC complied its file, but successive reports on the gang noted it continued to grow despite the occasional loss of foot soldiers in confrontations with the authorities. At last count, the Tren del Llano was estimated to include 40 men and at least four women. It is uncertain how the band got its name. A GNB report indicates that several of El Picure's lieutenants, who have also now been killed, were union members in charge of collecting extortion fees in exchange for jobs laying the railway that runs through the center of the country. However, other large criminal organizations in Venezuela are also called trains: the Tren del Pacifico operating on the island of Margarita; Tren de Aragua in the state of the same name; Tren Azul in the northeastern state of Sucre, and Tren de Apure on the border with Colombia. It is likely that the name originated in prison, where underworld bosses called ""pranes,"" ""prames,"" or ""principals,"" exercise dominance over one or several structures they call ""cars."" If a boss amasses several cars, then it is considered a train. Sociologist Luis Cedeno, director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Organized Crime (Observatorio Venezolano del Delito Organizado), says that ""megabands"" like that led by El Picure tend to reproduce on the streets the structures and codes of the prison world. The Tren del Llano recruited its members in the state of Guarico, above all from the El Sombrero neighborhood Concha de Mango, where El Picure grew up. The gang would even regularly organize block parties in the area, announcing them on its Facebook page. One of those parties, labeled the Gran Rumba Tren del Llano, caught the authorities' attention in 2013. Judicial police tried to capture El Picure at a rodeo style event, a traditional pastime in which riders on horseback try to pull a bull to the ground by grabbing his tail. But he escaped the trap, as he had numerous other attempts to capture him. The GNB said the gang boss was able to evade them due to his extensive knowledge of local geography and his Special Forces training from his time in the Navy and the incident fed the legend of El Picure -- a legend that has inspired Hip Hop and Reggaeton songs. However, it was the Tren del Llano's killing of 11 state agents during El Picure's time as its leader that made the gang stand out. These murders included agents from military counter-intelligence, state intelligence, the judicial police and regional police officers as well as the first sergeant of the GNB that was killed in the operation that took down El Picure. It was this violence that made El Picure the police's biggest target. Security forces extended their manhunt to include all of his friends and cohorts. Two days before they caught up with him, police killed El Picure's older brother and the father of one of his girlfriends. After the death of El Picure, the Tren del Llano has now been left decimated and leaderless and its future is uncertain. Previously, the Tren del Llano had attempted to form alliances with other criminal gangs, including the Tren de Aragua, the Valles del Tuy, which operate just outside of Caracas, and the Sin Techos (Roofless) and El 70, both of which operate in the capital, and surviving members of El Picure's gang could incorporate into these other criminal structures. They may also turn to the gang led by Juvenal Bravo, who unhitched himself from El Picure's train some four years ago and had recently made incursions in Guarico. The GNB accuses Bravo of leading Venezuela's most active gang of kidnappers, who were allegedly responsible for more than 230 victims during the last months of 2014 and the beginning of 2015. Unlike El Picure, Bravo has gone to great lengths to avoid confrontations with state agents, at times releasing his victims at the first hint of police patrols. While he may not have the mythical status of El Picure, Bravo's more low key profile could help him expand his operations to the areas until recently controlled by the Tren del Llano."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Fewer Homicides Good Business for Colombias Organized Crime?Colombia's murder rate reached a 40-year low in 2015 despite evidence to suggest organized crime in the country is thriving, raising the question of what could lie behind this apparent contradiction. The latest statistics released by Colombian forensic institute Medicina Legal show there were 11,585 murders in Colombia in 2015, giving the country a homicide rate of 24.03 per 100,000 people. That's a 9 percent drop from 2014 when the murder rate was 26.46 and 12,626 people were killed. Speaking at a press conference , President Juan Manuel Santos announced this was Colombia's lowest murder rate in 40 years. The results make 2015 the sixth consecutive year of falling violence in Colombia, with year on year reductions from 2009, when 17,717 people were killed at a rate of 39.39 per 100,000 people. The steady drop in homicides in Colombia is welcome news at a time when the country is drawing ever closer to a peace deal expected to end half a century of war between the state and guerrilla insurgents. However, there is little to indicate the fall in violence correlates with a drop in organized crime activities. In fact, the opposite may be true. As violence has been falling, cocaine production has bounced back dramatically after years of decline, and Colombian trafficking networks now distribute to an ever greater range of countries. Organized crime has also diversified its national interests substantially into lucrative activities such as extortion and illegal mining, giving the groups a much broader base of income. There are several likely reasons for this apparent contradiction. It could be indicative of Colombia's organized crime networks taking a more low-key approach, keeping violence levels down so they do not to draw attention or security forces to their areas of operations. These efforts can be seen in places such as the city of Medellin, where warring organized crime networks struck a pact to end the fighting, divide up the criminal spoils of the city and collaborate on international drug trafficking. The result has been the lowest murder rate in decades , but tempered by rising numbers of disappearances and macabre discoveries of locations used to dismember and dispose of bodies -- another way to keep official murder figures down. People simply disappear. Another likely contributing factor is the current underworld dynamic. Much of Colombia's violence over the last decade has been driven by the criminalized remnants of demobilized counter-insurgents -- groups the government labeled BACRIM (from ""bandas criminals"" or criminal bands). However, now there is only one BACRIM -- the Urabenos -- with a genuine national reach , and where their hegemony is challenged by BACRIM rivals it tends to be in smaller, more localized conflicts than those seen in the recent past."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Colombias Struggling Anti-Coca Strategy Needs US Backing: Report. A new report quantifies the progress of Colombia's coca crop substitution program under the peace agreement, and calls for US leniency and support despite a rocky start and a closing window of opportunity. More than 115,000 families have been included in agreements signed between communities and Colombia's National Integrated Program for the Substitution of Illegal Crops (Programa Nacional Integral de Sustitucion de Cultivos de Uso Ilicito - PNIS), according to a report presented by the Ideas for Peace Foundation (Fundacion Ideas Para la Paz - FIP) on October 19. Launched in January 2017, this program aims to help farmers voluntarily eradicate their coca crops in exchange for subsidies and government support for switching to legal crops. The measure, a pillar of Colombia's peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ) and the country's anti-drug strategy, aims for the voluntary eradication of 50,000 hectares of coca this year. Of the 115,000 families included in the collective agreements, nearly 25,000 families have already taken the next step of signing individual agreements with PNIS to receive subsidies in exchange for destroying their crops. More than 6,000 have been certified by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) that verifies the number of hectareage per family, and whether the crops were planted before the agreement. Another 5,000 families are undergoing verification, says FIP's report. The rate of successful voluntary eradication is just under 95 percent, and 2,350 hectares have already been destroyed since PNIS first started paying families in May. The FIP estimates that the program should allow for a total of more than 10,000 hectares to be destroyed by the end of the year -- around 20% of the official goal set at 50,000 hectares. The report underlines how complex the program's implementation is due to PNIS' limited resources; the difficult access to rural areas where security is lacking; the historic lack of state presence in these abandoned areas that fuels mistrust from local communities; and the absence of an efficient integral strategy for rural development. The document also provides some strong recommendations for the Colombian and US governments. Stressing the ""window of opportunity"" to act ""opened by the disarmament of the FARC,"" the report warns that: ""This window is closing quickly. Organized armed groups including FARC dissidents, the ELN, criminal organizations such as the ""Clan del Golfo"" [Urabenos] are rapidly progressing in the occupation of the regions."" It also appeals for patience and a more comprehensive perspective on the part of the United States. Calling for more US support in institution-building and rural development domains, the report also underlines that excessive US pressure on Colombia could ultimately be counterproductive. The FIP's assessment of Colombia's voluntary crop substitution program comes as the United States has voiced dissatisfaction with its Andean partner's anti-coca strategy. President Donald Trump threatened last month to decertify Colombia as a country complying with its anti-narcotic obligations, while a recent congressional hearing in Washington, DC revealed the extent of certain top US official's skepticism toward Colombia's coca reduction strategy. SEE ALSO : Colombia News and Profiles At first glance, FIP's estimate that Colombia will only reach 20 percent of its voluntary eradication goal speaks to US criticisms, but the eradication aim was deemed by many as unrealistic from the start. In addition, a return to aerial fumigation of coca fields using a harmful insecticide, which allowed Colombia to eradicate huge amounts in past years, seems highly unlikely now. A potential total of 10,000 hectares voluntarily eradicated combined with forced eradication efforts aiming to wipe out 50,000 hectares this year, would actually be a very decent amount when compared to manual eradication figures over the past three years. Rather than calling for a different strategy, the report's estimate is an argument for increased efforts on the program. As the FIP stresses, even as the PNIS lacks the resources to exploit the voluntary crop substitution strategy to its fullest, the window of opportunity for the government to secure lasting ties with coca farming communities is closing, as criminal groups continue to move in on territories abandoned by the FARC."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Convicts First Mayor for Ties to Gangs. A former El Salvador mayor has become the country's first mayor to be convicted of illicit association with gangs, a small step toward addressing the widespread problem of gang infiltration of local politics, which could affect upcoming elections. Jose Elias Hernandez, the former mayor of El Salvador's Apopa municipality on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador, was convicted February 1 of illicit association with the Barrio 18 gang and sentenced to 12 years in prison. According to Judge Godofredo Salazar, sufficient evidence was provided by the Attorney General's Office to prove that Hernandez provided various benefits to local factions of the Barrio 18, including money transfers and access to vehicles and gasoline, during both of his terms in office from 2012 to 2015 and through his reelection in 2015. A recent InSight Crime investigation delved into the details of Hernandez's ties to the gangs, illustrating the way in which Hernandez's connections benefited both him and the gangs. Hernandez was originally charged with associating with a terrorist organization, but the judge changed the charge to illicit association, citing the fact that the illegal activities engaged in by the mayor and members of the gang did not cause ""social alarm,"" as they were committed clandestinely. Hernandez was found not guilty on the additional charge of homicide due to a lack of solid evidence, the convicting judge said. Hernandez will likely appeal the decision. Several other former municipal officials are also currently under investigation for ties to gangs. Miguel Angel Jaime, the former mayor of Usulutan, was arrested in June 2017, on charges of financing multiple cliques of the Barrio 18's rival, the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13). Jose Manuel Turcios, the former mayor of Jucuapa, was also arrested on similar charges in September 2017. In early January 2018, Hector Gomez Escobar, an alleged gang member on El Salvador's list of 100 most wanted criminals, was arrested after being selected to run for office in upcoming municipal elections. Ahead of the legislative and municipal elections scheduled for early March 2018, Attorney General Douglas Melendez has recently ordered the arrests of more than 300 individuals linked to gangs and accused of interfering in political campaigns. Melendez has also called on the country's political parties to be careful in their selection of candidates and to avoid interference from criminal elements. ""The political parties, and candidates running for positions as officials, governors or congress members, need to be very measured, very cautious and in control over who they are working with and forming alliances with,"" Melendez said, adding that ""people linked to crime or gangs"" should not ""have any influence over the work of political parties."" El Salvador's first ever conviction of a mayor for ties to gangs shows that the country's judicial system has the capacity to take down corrupted officials, but as this year's municipal elections approach, the widespread influence of gangs in politics continues to pose significant challenges. As InSight Crime documented in a recent investigative series, mayors in Central America's northern triangle countries of El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras often serve as a nexus of crime and political power. The relationships built between politicians and gangs are widespread, as they are mutually beneficial: allowing gangs to expand or maintain influence over territories, while politicians gain or maintain local political control. This dynamic is evident in El Salvador, not just at the local level but at the national level. For example, InSight Crime obtained several videos in 2016 that showed El Salvador's two main political parties, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional - FMLN) and Nationalist Republican Alliance (Alianza Republicana Nacionalista - ARENA), agreed to channel government-funded projects to gang members in exchange for support during the country's 2014 presidential elections. As the country's March elections approach, Police Chief Howard Cotto has warned that gangs are again infiltrating local politics. Actions taken by Attorney General Melendez to arrest candidates and officials suspected of ties to criminal groups, as well as the recent conviction of Hernandez, indicate that the judicial system is still working to dismantle these corrupt networks. However, sustained efforts will be required to address the structural problems that open the door for the widespread and deeply ingrained influence of gangs to perpetuate in El Salvador's politics."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Venezuela Intelligence Chief Exposes Organized Crime Links in Maduro Govt. General Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figuera, the former head of intelligence in Venezuela, has made revealing declarations about the government of Nicolas Maduro For the second time in six months, a former head of Venezuela's military intelligence service has made major revelations about the links between President Nicolas Maduro's administration and organized crime. General Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figuera was the most prominent Venezuelan official to desert the regime during a failed opposition uprising on April 30, 2019. Figuera subsequently fled to the United States, where he spoke to the Washington Post about the rampant internal criminality that, he claims, convinced him to defect from Maduro's government. Having served for six months as head of the notorious Bolivarian Intelligence Service (Servicio Bolivariano de Inteligencia Nacional - SEBIN), Cristopher Figuera was a member of Maduro's inner circle and privy to the regime's most guarded secrets of criminal collusion and corruption. Many of his statements echo those made by General Hugo Carvajal Barrios , another former head of the SEBIN who spoke out in February regarding Maduro's links to organized crime. Below, InSight Crime examines four key quotes from the Cristopher Figuera interview. 1. ""Maduro is the head of a criminal enterprise, with his own family involved."" A shadowy drug-trafficking network known as the "" Cartel of the Suns "" is embedded deep into the Venezuelan military, implicating officials in the highest ranks of the Maduro administration and even the president's own family. In 2016, the nephews of Maduro's wife were convicted of attempting to smuggle 800 kilograms of cocaine into the United States, sourced from the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarios de Colombia -- FARC). Figuera told the Washington Post that he had also seen intelligence implicating Maduro's son, Nicolas Maduro Guerra, in a gold racket exploiting small mines in the south of the country. Figuera claims he was warned not to pursue the investigation. Four days after Figuera's interview, Nicolas Maduro was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department for his role in the ""illegitimate"" National Constituent Assembly, a body that serves to undermine the opposition-controlled National Assembly and further entrench Maduro's regime. 2. ""The minister of industry is involved. The minister of finance is involved. The president of the Central Bank is involved."" Figuera listed senior Venezuelan officials involved in this state-run ""criminal enterprise."" In particular, Figuera mentioned the Minister of Industries and former Vice President Tareck El Aissami , claiming his involvement in money laundering. El Aissami has already been sanctioned in the United States for allegedly coordinating drug shipments from Venezuelan airstrips and ports, including to the Zetas Mexican drug cartel. Declarations by drug trafficker Walid Makled in 2010 pointed to El Aissami as having been the link between the FARC and operatives of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in Venezuela, an accusation corroborated by Carvajal. Other officials singled out in Figuera's testimony are Finance Minister Simon Zerpa and Central Bank President Calixto Jose Ortega Sanchez. Zerpa is currently under US sanctions for suspected involvement in the massive corruption associated with Venezuela's state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA). Ortega is implicated in allegations that the Central Bank has helped to keep Maduro in power by facilitating illegal gold sales. 3. ""I found that the issues of narco-trafficking and guerrillas were not to be addressed."" Figuera spoke of his distress at the arbitrary arrests conducted by his own department and insisted that investigations into genuine criminal collusion were obstructed at the highest level of government. As well as affirming the presence of drug traffickers within the administration, he also claimed to have seen intelligence demonstrating government protection for armed guerrilla organizations, including Colombia's National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) and Hezbollah. The ELN has been expanding rapidly in Venezuela and is involved in a plethora of criminal activities, including drug trafficking, illegal mining, extortion and smuggling. The ELN forms part of a broader panorama of irregular armed groups propping up Maduro's government. These include a Venezuelan guerrilla organization known as the Patriotic Forces for National Liberation (Fuerzas Patrioticas de Liberacion Nacional -- FPLN) and the paramilitary groups known as "" colectivos ."" 4. ""[Iris Varela] said that she had trained male prisoners. That she was their commander."" The former intelligence chief also described a meeting at which Prisons Minister Iris Varela demanded 30,000 rifles to start a private army of convicts. Figuera's allegations against her reflect recent reports of power struggles within the Maduro administration, which have purportedly led Varela to build her own force comprised of the prisoners under her ministry's jurisdiction. In an interview with InSight Crime, Varela denied Figuera's claims, stating: ""Do you know how many weapons I've seized in the prisons I've closed since I arrived in this ministry? Many, thousands. And I've given them all in. If I'd wanted weapons, I would have had plenty with those."" Varela has presided over a series of prison reforms that enabled prison gang leaders, known as "" pranes, "" to gain unprecedented control over the penitentiary system. These crime bosses now run extensive criminal structures both inside and outside the prison system, charging fellow prisoners for access to necessities and privileges and directing the activities of street gangs. Varela also rejected the alleged creation of a parallel army of prisoners. ""To do that would be to admit that I [Varela] would be creating a parallel government and that is not the case. I have great respect for the Constitution, which he [Figuera] does not,"" she stated. However, Varela admitted she was willing to use prisoners to defend Venezuela in case of foreign military intervention. ""I am clear that, independently of the legal situation facing any Venezuelan, there is no obstacle for them to go to defend the nation in case of a foreign aggression,"" she told InSight Crime. ""If they threaten us with 5,000 marines, we have 45,000 prisoners. Not 30,000, and I correcting that idiot [Figuera],"" added Varela. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"How Drug Traffickers Became Masters of Honduras Forests. Illegal timber and drug trafficking are closely linked in northeastern Honduras, a major cocaine corridor in this region. There, criminal groups have savvily combined these two businesses to maximize their illicit profits. Although the town of Dulce Nombre de Culmi is nestled in the mountains of northeastern Honduras, the town has a gritty, lived-in feel. A well-maintained Franciscan church acts as a reminder of local priorities, and on Mondays, the streets surrounding the central plaza are bustling with commerce. Food and clothing stalls crowd the sidewalks, while farm and construction equipment are sold indoors. But to understand what makes this town really tick, one needs to look at the nearby forests of pine, mahogany and cedar. They feed a timber trade that was worth around $60-80 million between 2016 and 2018 in Honduras. But environmental agencies in Honduras warn that 50-60 percent of this trade comes from illegal logging, much of it from the country's northeastern natural reserves where drug trafficking has also found a home. *This article is the result of research on eco-trafficking in the region done in conjunction with American University's Center for Latin American and Latino Studies ( CLALS ). Culmi, as the locals call it, is the last settlement before entering the Rio Platano Biosphere , a protected forest in which drug trafficking and illegal logging have literally crossed paths for more than a decade. To the south lies the city of Catacamas, an obligatory stop to get to rest of the country. To the north, the forest hides clandestine smuggling routes to the barren spaces of Honduras' Atlantic Coast, on the border with Nicaragua. The mountains and plains surrounding Culmi are dotted with clandestine airstrips, many built during the drug boom a decade ago. In 2007, Honduras' civil aviation authority counted at least 100 clandestine airstrips in Olancho, the department where Catacamas and Culmi are located. In 2014, the government of President Juan Orlando Hernandez claimed to have destroyed 75 clandestine airstrips nationwide. Santos Orellana , a Honduran army captain who was part of an anti-narcotics task force from 2012 to 2016, said Olancho had at least 300 airstrips, while he was in the government. They had almost all been carved from the dense forests in the area. The wood was then sold to timber traffickers as well as drug trafficking groups. To be sure, in Olancho, Yoro and Gracias a Dios--three departments all renowned for their timber production--drug trafficking groups are known to double-dip in timber trafficking. Orellana, as well as four other Honduran officials, including prosecutors and members of the forestry authority who InSight Crime spoke to on condition of anonymity, all said that cross-over between the two illegal industries was common. At least three large drug trafficking groups in this region engaged in illegal logging, they said. Each criminal economy complements the other, they added. First, groups of farmers, often migrants from the poorest areas of southern Honduras, settle in unpopulated lands in and around the Rio Platano Biosphere. There, they harvest wood illegally, often with protection from corrupt officials and politicians, as well as support from drug trafficking groups. The wood is usually cut without securing official permission from Honduras' Institute of Forest Conservation of Honduras (ICF). It is then combined with legal shipments, mostly at the saw mills, either by falsifying logging permits or bribing police responsible for monitoring timber transport. It then mostly helps satisfy local markets. Meanwhile, illegally harvested precious woods, such as mahogany and cedar, usually head north along clandestine routes to the department of Gracias a Dios, and from there to processing hubs such as La Ceiba. These are the same routes that drug shipments travel along. One of the most prominent leads to remote areas near the Honduras - Nicaraguan border. ""There is a clandestine road from Culmi to Tahuaca, on the border with Nicaragua, which belongs to these drug traffickers,"" said Fausto Mejia, director of Independent Forest Monitoring, an NGO which was formerly attached to Honduras' Human Rights Ombudsman and now regularly reports on illegal logging in the country. ""Access to such clandestine roads is blocked with chains and padlocks, controlled by drug gangs in the area."" Local sources and researchers in Tegucigalpa and Catacamas said that logging remains a secondary business interest for drug traffickers. They are primarily interested in seizing remote lands to build airstrips to move drugs. ""This is why they take over space in the forest,"" a former environmental prosecutor in Tegucigalpa, who requested anonymity, commented. The drugs arriving by plane are then shipped out on ""pipantes,"" long, flat boats used for river navigation, often hidden among the timber. These joint cargoes travel for hours along the Patuca and Tawahka rivers and are then moved by mules along remote trails until they reach the clandestine roads controlled by drug traffickers, who rule as uncontested lords of the forest. *This article is the result of research on eco-trafficking in the region done in conjunction with American University's Center for Latin American and Latino Studies ( CLALS ).

"Missing Mexican Band Members Found Dead on Traffickers Ranch. Several members of a band who had been missing since January 25 were found dead in the north Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, in a ranch allegedly belonging to drug traffickers. Between 18 and 20 members of Kombo Kolombia, a band playing Colombian-style music, went missing after performing at a private party in the town of Hidalgo. A band member who escaped told authorities that some 10 gunmen had interrupted the party, forced the band into a van, and driven them out of town. He heard the men question his bandmates about if they were in a drug cartel, then gunshots, as the Associated Press reported. The state Attorney General's Office reported that 14 bodies have been found in a pit on a ranch in the town of Minas, 30 kilometers from where the party was held, and that they had gunshot wounds and signs of torture, reported El Diario. Authorities are continuing the search for more bodies. Police said that they thought the band was contracted for the party as a trap. Official sources told El Diario that Kombo Kolombia had performed in bars linked to the Zetas gang. This would not be the first time that Mexican musicians have been caught up in drug violence. In one high-publicized case, popular singer Diego Rivas was gunned down in Sinaloa state in 2011. He was well-known for singing ""narcocorrido"" songs , a genre which celebrates drug trafficking, and there have been a number of other cases of narcocorrido singers being killed after apparently falling foul of their subjects. Kombo Kolombia, however, did not play narcocorrido songs, but vallenato, a genre of romantic Colombian music, and cumbia, an upbeat musical style from Colombia's coast. Nuevo Leon, close to the Texas border, is home to high levels of drug-related violence. Its capital, Monterrey, is currently the battleground in a bloody battle between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel, and has recently seen violence spurred by internal splits in the Zetas."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Arrests of Honduras Police Reveal Setbacks in Purge. The arrest of high-ranking Honduras police officers accused of having criminal network ties illustrates the challenges the government will have to tackle if it wants to successfully complete the purging of its police forces. On October 9, the Honduran Attorney General's Office announced the arrest of National Police Commissioner Lorgio Oqueli Mejia Tinoco and another 15 police officials, some on active duty and some who had already left the force or lost their positions. Those arrested stand accused of participating in a cattle trafficking network during the commissioner's previous tenure as head of the police force in Choluteca department, on the Nicaraguan border. At least three of the officers allegedly involved had already been let go as part of a purging process that began in 2016. More than 5,000 police employees have left the institution as a result of the purge, and another 2,000 are still being investigated. The Attorney General's Office is accusing Mejia of money laundering, bribery, illicit association and creating a ""criminal structure"" that charged cash bribes to allow transporters to move cattle without being stopped at police checkpoints. InSight Crime learned that some of the cattle entered Honduras illegally from Nicaragua. S EE ALSO : Honduras News and Profiles A later report from El Heraldo also indicated that Commissioner Mejia might be linked to the landing of a small plane loaded with drugs in Choluteca while he headed the department's police force. At the time the arrests were made, more than 31 assets were seized including seven homes, six vehicles and more than 20 bank accounts. Authorities are still to reveal more information about the massive amount of medications and medical supplies found in one of Mejia's properties when it was raided. The commissioner must now explain the origin of nearly 17 million lempiras (more than $700,000) found in his possession that do not correspond to the monthly salary of approximately $2,000 he received over the last two years. The commission in charge of the police purging process appointed Mejia as deputy police commissioner in May 2016. In 2018 he was promoted to commissioner, the highest position in the institution. While the process enacted to purge Honduras' police force has had some success since it began in mid-2016, it has also had its fair share of scandals and criticism. The situation involving Commissioner Mejia underscores some of the shortcomings in the process and raises concerns about the possible participation of other current police leaders in criminal activities. It is a wake-up call that police reform in Honduras remains an unfinished task that requires significant improvements in transparency, institutional coordination and political will if it is to be achieved. Despite Honduran law requiring that public officials declare their assets annually before the country's Superior Accounts Tribunal (Tribunal Superior de Cuentas - TSC), Mejia managed to fly under authorities' radar for years. Moreover, this is not the first time authorities have identified police officers on active duty who were supposed to have been purged from the ranks. In July media outlet La Prensa reported a case in which a detective continued to receive his salary of 21,000 lempiras (nearly $900) a month despite having been dismissed for alleged links to drug trafficking. In this and other cases, one way that police officials have managed to obstruct dismissal proceedings is by arguing that they are protected under Honduras' old organic police law. To such roadblocks in purging the police can be added structural difficulties in both the institution itself and other governmental bodies. Conflicts of interest are commonplace, such as the police force investigating itself. And the selection process for Honduras' attorney general ensures that the Attorney General's Office often has its hands tied when it comes to independently investigating and pursuing cases, as evidenced in the paltry number of convictions it has secured for some of the country's most important cases. One bright spot is that Honduras has strengthened its money laundering laws. Recent sentences of up to 15 years were leveled against former police officers with lower ranks than Mejia in a case of illicit enrichment involving only a fraction of the money allegedly tied to the commissioner. With the country's new legislation possibly bringing sentencing up to 20 years, it is no wonder that so many purged police officers implicated in crimes are jumping at the chance to be extradited to the United States -- where they often receive much less jail time -- to face their charges. Such was the case of a Honduran police officer who was sentenced to five years in prison in the United States for trafficking cocaine there. In another case , Carlos Valladares, former regional commander of Honduras' now-defunct special criminal investigation unit (Direccion Nacional de Investigacion Criminal - DNIC) in the city of San Pedro Sula, was recently sentenced in the United States to 14 years in prison. The charges against Valladares were related to his involvement with the Cachiros drug trafficking group, with the United States alleging that he worked for them as a hitman.

"Colombia Govt Claims Success Against Urabenos, But Group Remains Strong. A recent series of deadly attacks against police in Colombia attributed to the Urabenos hasn't stopped authorities from trumpeting their successes against the criminal group, despite evidence of the Urabenos' persistent strength. The Urabenos criminal group, the most powerful in Colombia, is accused of having orchestrated yet another attack against Colombian law enforcement, resulting in the death of a police officer in the Caribbean city of Acandi in the department of Choco, reported Caracol Radio on May 8. According to the news outlet, two other police officers were killed within a span of a week in the neighboring department of Antioquia. In addition, a police commander was murdered in the northern city of Valledupar on May 5. Authorities stated that the alleged attacker, who was killed during his arrest, was a member of the Urabenos, according to El Colombiano. The spate of murders of police officers stretches back to March and has in part been attributed to the National Liberation Army ( Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) rebel group. But authorities have also argued that the most recent murders have been retaliation on the part of the Urabenos for security operations against the group. Since February 2017, at least three high-profile figures of the criminal organization have been killed during police operations, and a fourth was arrested in Medellin, reported El Colombiano in a separate article. On May 3, shortly after the third death of a high-ranking Urabenos figure, a police patrol responding to an emergency call in the San Cristobal area near Medellin was attacked with an explosive device that was thrown inside the police vehicle. Two officers were injured in an act that was described as part of the criminal group's retaliatory actions. SEE ALSO : Urabenos News and Profile Meanwhile, on May 6, authorities held a ceremony to congratulate police officers who participated in ""Operation Agamenon,"" reported Radio Sante Fe. The operation, launched in February 2015, led to the deployment of significant firepower, including military helicopters and bombardments of camps , with the aim of destroying the Urabenos in their traditional stronghold, the Caribbean Uraba region, which is used as a launchpad for cocaine shipments. One of the explicit objectives from the start was the capture of the criminal group's top leader, Dario Antonio Usuga, alias ""Otoniel."" Authorities list among the operation's successes the capture of more than 1,000 suspected Urabenos members and the seizure of 44 metric tons of cocaine, according to Radio Sante Fe. General Jorge Hernando Nieto Rojas, the head of Colombia's National Police, asserted that the criminal organization ""has been dismantled by more than 50 percent."" The number of Urabenos members reportedly captured during Operation Agamenon as well as the large seizures of cocaine suggest that authorities have succeeded in delivering some blows to the criminal organization. In addition, the pressure from the long-running operation appears to be one of the explanatory factors for the group's attempt to take over trafficking routes in the Choco department. Still, the Colombian government's assertions that their efforts have significantly weakened the Urabenos deserve close scrutiny. Various signs, including the string of recent attacks against police officers, indicate that the group continues to wield significant criminal power. In fact, reports have indicated that the Urabenos have been extending their reach , including along the country's Pacific Coast and in Putumayo along the border with Ecuador. SEE ALSO : Colombia News and Profiles And while the government boasts about the large volume of cocaine seizures, the size of these busts actually points to the organization's continued strength. Moreover, nearly two years after the start of Operation Agamenon, authorities have yet to capture Otoniel. In other words, the initiative has so far failed to achieve its prime objective. The Urabenos' leader has so far evaded capture and remains at large ."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Could Argentina See Another Alberto Nisman Scandal?Criminals have attacked a prosecutor investigating corrupt police networks, pointing to a growing boldness by Argentina's criminal actors but also evidence that a new government crackdown on organized crime could be having an impact. Fernando Cartasegna, a Buenos Aires prosecutor, was assaulted in his office, tied to a chair and beaten by a single attacker during the afternoon of May 3, reported Clarin. Before leaving, his attacker wrote the word ""Nisman"" in sugar on the floor. The message was a reference to Alberto Nisman, who was found dead in January 2015 after working on the case of the 1994 Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (Asociacion Mutual Israelita Argentina -- AMIA) bombing that had targeted the Jewish community in Argentina's capital. He was found shot dead in his home a day before he was to testify in congress and shortly after having publicly accused former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of covering up elements of the attack. The prosecutor's death sparked widespread controversy and an investigation into the circumstances of his death is ongoing. Cartasegna is currently investigating allegedly corrupt police officers and lawyers from the Buenos Aires province accused of tampering with traffic accident compensations. The investigation is part of a much broader probe into police corruption in Buenos Aires, where officers have been implicated in other criminal activities including prostitution, drug trafficking and extortion. This isn't the first attack on Cartasegna -- just days before he was ambushed in his office, two men and a woman dressed in decommissioned police uniforms approached the prosecutor outside the city courtrooms and allegedly threatened to kill him if he kept digging into the police extortion scheme. His aggressors struck Cartasegna in the head with an old police bludgeon, according to Clarin. Placards of his photo and that of Nisman were left on the judiciary building with the words ""Meet the new Nisman."" A pamphlet threatening Cartasegna (bottom) with Nisman's fate, Courtesy of Clarin The attacks against Cartasegna should be viewed in the context of intensive efforts by the authorities to reform the Buenos Aires police and rid it of corruption. In 2016, 200 people from the police were jailed on corruption charges , and 3,300 more were dismissed. That both aggressions took place during the daytime -- one in his office and the other in front of the courtrooms -- is evidence of a growing trend of increased confidence on the part of criminal actors. These networks now appear bold enough to openly target judiciary officials, in plain light of day. In October last year a federal tribunal in Buenos Aires that had dealt with major drug trafficking cases was set on fire , and a threatening message was left, this time addressed to the governor of the province. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Argentina Yet these attacks on the judiciary should also be seen as evidence that changes in policies targeting organized crime could be hitting their mark and disturbing, although not yet dismantling, some criminal networks. Since President Mauricio Macri took power, the government has placed an emphasis on tackling drug trafficking and corruption. Although, as InSight Crime has previously noted , some measures aiming at militarizing this struggle are debatable, Macri's administration deserves some credit for its focus on eradicting corruption within its law enforcement and political institutions."	0	1	0	1	0	0	0
"Uruguay Fears Brazilian Narco Incursion. Uruguay is one of Latin America's safest countries, but according to the Ministry of the Interior the country is threatened by Brazilian drug traffickers who may be making their way south. Sources from Uruguay's Interior Ministry told Ultimas Noticias , ""There is a great fear that the [Brazilian] traffickers will begin to operate from [Uruguay]. The only way to avoid this is to increase border control and prevent their entry."" Some experts have said that due to Brazil's newly assertive security policies, in anticipation of the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, Brazilian criminal groups are in search of a more hospitable environment. According to Uruguayan Interior Minister Eduardo Bonomi , ""What can happen is that in searching for a safer area to operate from, [the Brazilian traffickers] come here. Not in order to use the Uruguayan market, but to continue their activities from a safer place."" Police officials from Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil will convene in Buenos Aires next week at their biannual meeting. Interior Ministry sources told Ultimas Noticias that Brazilian gang activity will be a major topic at the conference, adding, ""We have still not observed the arrival of these traffickers [in Uruguay], but we will not wait to start acting."" These statements by Uruguay's Interior Ministry follow a warning issued by Brazilian Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo that Brazil's crackdown on drug gangs in the country's favelas could trigger a migration of criminals south. While Uruguay has long been cited as one of the region's safest countries, there are some warning signs that drug trafficking and related gang violence may be increasing. Minister Bonomi's fears stretch back as far as 2010 when he warned of the internationalization of organized crime in the country , pointing to the presence of Mexican, Serbian, Colombian, and Brazilian groups. To date, however, Uruguay has not suffered to the same extent as other countries bordering Brazil, notably Paraguay , where Brazilian gangs like the First Capital Command (PCC) and Comando Vermelho (Red Command) reportedly both have a foothold. This is largely because Uruguay is not a drug producer like Paraguay, the largest producer of marijuana in South America. Instead, Uruguay is primarily a transit country for narcotics, meaning Brazilian traffickers have less interest in setting up a permanent presence here. However, this means Uruguay has received comparatively little attention from Brazil's $6.3 billion border security initiative that aims to crack down on drug trafficking, with most of the resources reserved for the Brazilian frontier along Bolivia and Paraguay. The Commander of the Brazilian Army South Region, General Carlos Goellner, admitted last year that the troop deployment along the Uruguay border was ""soft."" "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"How Venezuelas Military Tried to Fly A Ton of Cocaine to France. Behind the biggest cocaine haul in French history were members of Venezuela's military. InSight Crime's investigation reveals the trafficking methods used by corrupt military cells and the covert international police operation that brought the smuggling ring down. The seizure was extraordinary, both for the amount and the fact it had arrived by air, UN drug trafficking expert Thomas Pietschmann told the New York Times. How did 1.3 tons of cocaine make its way on to an Air France commercial passenger plane traveling between two of the world's major international airports? The drugs had been packed into 31 bright-colored suitcases (later lined up and displayed on French television) and assigned names that did not correspond with any of the passengers on the plane. It was immediately clear that there was extensive involvement of Venezuela's National Guard (GNB), which manages Caracas' international airport of Maiquetia. ""Anyone who has witnessed the elaborate controls the National Guard keeps over every aspect of passenger and bag movements in Maiquetia -- where woe be onto you if you try to leave the country with two packs of coffee in your bag as souvenirs -- knows perfectly well you can't get [31] ghost bags onto a plane without them knowing about it,"" wrote Venezuelan blogger and analyst Francisco Toro. The involvement of Venezuela's military in drug trafficking has been increasing, progressing from simply facilitating the trade in the 1990s to actively purchasing and transporting product during the 2000s. But 1.3 tons of cocaine loaded onto a commercial flight takes the brazenness of this trafficking to new levels. ""This was the most audacious [smuggling operation] in Venezuela's history,"" says Javier Mayorca, a journalist who has been investigating the case. ""And it is absolutely unthinkable, impossible, that it was carried out without [military] cooperation at the very highest levels."" SEE ALSO : Cartel de Los Soles Profile Sources with knowledge of Maquetia airport consulted by InSight Crime say the cocaine-stuffed suitcases did not pass through the inside of the building but instead arrived on a vehicle that entered through a tradesmen's entrance on the airport's western side. This way they avoided the scanning system and the possibility of being discovered by National Guard members not involved in the operation. According to Elisio Guzman, the ex-director of Venezuela's national police investigations agency Cicpc, the shipment was probably then kept in one of the airport's ""sterile zones"": a term used to describe warehouses where previously-checked baggage is stored. This conflicts with the version given by Venezuela's National Anti-Drugs Office (ONA), whose director Alejandro Keleris recently told press that video evidence showed the suitcases did pass through scanners. It still had to make its way onto the plane, however, which would have been one of the most challenging parts of the operation, according to Mayorca. ""Weight has to be extremely carefully distributed on a plane, and this was a huge amount of weight,"" he said. ""The flight dispatcher or load planner, who assigns where baggage will be distributed throughout the hold, is one of the most important jobs in the airline crew and in this case they had to be complicit in what was going on."" Alejandro Rebolledo, an ex-judge and anti-money laundering advisor, told Mayorca he had information the drug trafficking group -- believed to be formed of civilian criminals and collaborating military members -- had been testing the route for months. They would replace genuine passengers' suitcases with others carrying cocaine, that then disappeared upon arrival in France. ""Passengers' suitcases didn't arrive, and would then arrive a day later,"" delivered directly to Paris, he said. ""This kept happening,"" he said. French police began to pay attention due to the frequency of the complaints. European police already had a close eye on Venezuela and its military, said Mildred Camero, a former judge and the ex-president of the ONA, due to former interdictions and years of evidence that senior figures had collaborated with Colombian guerrilla group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to exchange weapons for drugs. Camero told InSight Crime that police in France, Italy and Spain had launched a joint investigation some months previous, operating undercover in Europe and Venezuela without the knowledge of the Venezuelan government. ""They could not tell the Venezuelan government what was going on, because they knew that high-ranking Venezuelan military officials were involved."" Italian police managed to infiltrate the criminal operation, she said, getting details from informants about collaboration between the Venezuelans and the Ndrangheta, the powerful Italian mafia who are estimated to control 80 percent of the cocaine coming into Europe. The 'Ndrangheta were due to receive the shipment, which Camero believes was originally purchased by the GNB from the FARC in the border state of Apure. The plan was closely followed from July onwards, she said. On the day itself, European police boarded the plane disguised as regular passengers, Camero believes. Once the suitcases were offloaded, 900 kilos of cocaine were followed to Luxembourg, while another 400 kilos were followed to a storehouse in the center of Paris, before all was seized. ""This was a totally controlled operation,"" said Camero. The shipment's final destination was the Italian city of Napoli. What remains unknown is whether the flight crew were involved in the sting. Did the pilot, the air stewardesses, know who and what was on their plane? None were arrested in France, which suggests they may have been working with police. It is unlikely that Air France would have wanted the negative publicity arising from the seizure, but they may not have had any choice about whether it took place or not. Meanwhile in Venezuela, 28 people have now been detained -- National Guard members, including a lieutenant colonel, one of their wives, Air France employees, Caracas airport staff, and one person who has not been identified. ONA director Keleris said on October 15 that an order of detention for the ""owner"" of the drugs had also been issued, but did not reveal their identity. Three Italians and three British citizens were also arrested in Paris. However no senior GNB figures have been held accountable. The Venezuelan arrests are pure window dressing, says Mayorca, and do not target those truly responsible. An examination of the financial accounts of the detained has failed to uncover any suspicious transactions, apart from one payment of $57,000 for a house made by the wife on the list (a discovery which sparked her arrest). ""That is peanuts,"" he said, given the value of the haul estimated at around $270 million by a source close to the French investigation. ""Hundreds of millions of dollars changed hands, where is it?"" Family members of the accused protested their innocence and the lack of a proper judicial process outside a court near the airport earlier this month, claiming they had been made scapegoats. A parliamentary commission has been set up to investigate the case, but is likely to be a total whitewash, according to Camero and other analysts. The military is a crucial power base for President Nicolas Maduro, as it was for his predecessor Hugo Chavez, and loyalty is valued above all else in a government with an extreme concentration of power in its leadership. Offering different theories as to why allegations of drug trafficking within the GNB had never been properly investigated, analyst James Bosworth said it could be that ""Maduro knows the Venezuelan military is corrupted by organized crime, but is afraid to move against them."" As for the parliamentary commission, the members ""are not independent of the Executive so are not going to point fingers at the National Guard,"" said David Smilde, a Venezuela expert with the Washington Office on Latin America. They will likely highlight the international dimension of this, he added: collaborators in Air France, Paris, and the broader drug trafficking network. ""The only time the government would crack down on anything is for political reasons. Maduro is willing to turn a blind eye to corruption."" ""They will say that it was civilians trafficking the drugs, that it was members of opposition extremists,"" said Camero, who believes involvement in drug trafficking is endemic throughout the military, even at its highest levels. ""The investigation will go absolutely nowhere."""	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
Kidnapping Drops 42% in Guatemala in 3 Years: NGO. Kidnapping in Guatemala dropped some 42 percent between 2008 and 2011 by the count of one NGO, which may be due to the increased number of cases being brought to trial instead of languishing in the court system. According to Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo (GAM), Guatemala saw 213 kidnappings in 2008. The total dropped steadily over the following four years, falling to 126 cases in 2011. EFE reports that these figures are similar to those kept by Guatemala's National Police, who had slightly different totals for 2009 and 2010, but otherwise agreed with GAM's statistics. One reason for the decline in kidnappings could be the number of successfully prosecuted cases. According to EFE, the NGO found that of the 330 suspects arrested on kidnapping charges since 2008, 247 have been sentenced. This is high compared to a crime like femicide, for which just 28 cases resulted in sentencing in 2010. Guatemala sees many more victims of femicide rather than kidnapping, with some 608 female murder victims registered in 2010 , according to Guatemala's forensic science institue. More cases overall are coming to trial and resulting in sentences in Guatemala, according to a recent study presented to the Supreme Court, reports Siglo 21. In the past two years, sentencing has increased 21.7 percent compared to 2008-2009. But the statistics kept by the Guatemala police and by GAM may not be entirely reliable, as not all kidnappings are reported. This is especially true when the victims are Central American migrants who travel through Guatemala en route to the US, although most migrant kidnappings appear to be concentrated in Mexico. Other kidnappings in Guatemala have reportedly been carried out by current and former police officers, which could result in lower counts by the police. 	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"US Senators Warn of Potential Security Crisis in Caribbean. A new United States Senate report argues that the Caribbean faces a potential security crisis, and that the US must take action to prevent a future increase in drug trafficking through the region. On September 13, the US Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, headed by California Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley, released an assessment on organized crime and security in the Caribbean (.pdf). Citing a recent increase in violence in the region, the Senators warned of a potential ""security crisis"" in the Caribbean, arguing that the US must do more to support these countries in the fight against drug trafficking. In addition to expressing support for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), created in 2011, and for Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) operations, the report makes three principal recommendations: first, the US should create more Sensitive Investigate Units (SIUs), or highly vetted, DEA-trained police units, in Caribbean nations. Second, the US should provide the full criminal history of deportees sent back to the Caribbean so that these countries are better prepared to deal with future criminal activity. Finally, the US should work with partner nations in the Caribbean to create or improve legal tools needed to combat drug trafficking, such as wiretapping and asset forfeiture laws. As the report admits, drug trafficking in the Caribbean is minimal compared to in Mexico and Central America; only an estimated 5% of the cocaine destined for the United States passes through the region. There have been some recent signs however, that traffickers are turning back to the Caribbean to move their product northwards. As a February 2012 United Nations report noted, there has been a marked increased in gang violence in the Caribbean, likely linked to drug trafficking activity. Additionally, aerial surveys by the US Military's Southern Command have shown an increase in maritime trafficking events on the Caribbean side of the Central American isthmus. As the report acknowledges, this potential shift back to the Caribbean is a result of the increased pressure on land routes through Central America and Mexico, a phenomenon known as the ""balloon effect,"" where pressure in one area simply pushes traffickers (or drug crops) into another ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Further Buildup on US-Mexico Border Unnecessary: Report. As conservative voices in the United States clamor for even tighter security along the Mexican border, a new study concludes that any further upsurge of forces would be counterproductive. In a report titled ""Beyond the Border Buildup: Security and Migrants along the US-Mexico Border,"" the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) and Mexico's College of the Northern Border (COLEF), found that further buildup of the Border Patrol would yield ""diminishing returns."" ""A closer look at the border reveals that after a historic buildup of the US security presence there, further increases in money, barriers and manpower are unnecessary,"" according to the report. Urging Washington to reassess its border policy, the report called on the government to ""view the border security buildup as a past policy, not a direction for the present or future."" Conservatives in the United States have been calling for reinforced security along the border, and have insisted more Border Patrol personnel are necessary. Added to this are calls to complete the construction of the fence that demarcates much of the 3,200 kilometer border, and even electrify the barrier to prevent illegal migrants from crossing into the United States. Fears in Arizona about Mexican cartel violence spilling into the US have led to a proposal for a new border militia. ""The facts contradict the call to escalate security along the border,"" said Adam Isacson, WOLA analyst and the study's co-author. ""The whirlwind security buildup should stop now,"" said Isacson. The buildup, which started two decades ago at a gradual pace, surged after the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York and Washington. It is aimed at stemming illegal immigration and drug trafficking, while trying to prevent the drug-fueled violence that has wracked Mexico from crossing into the US. The surge in border control has come at the hands of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and its sub agencies, as well as the Defense Department, which has deployed troops as back-up to the Border Patrol, and to collect intelligence. The Pentagon has been flying reconnaissance drones on both sides of the border. National Guard troops have also been deployed. Border agents have indeed seen an increase in drug seizures in recent years. Between 2005 and 2010, southwest border seizures of marijuana increased by 49 percent, methamphetamine by 54 percent, heroin by 297 percent and MDMA (ecstasy) by 839 percent, the report says. By contrast cocaine seizures have dropped 21 percent. Though the number of illegal migrants crossing the border is nearly impossible to estimate, apprehensions by the Border Patrol have fallen by 61 percent since 2005. But the report says the drop in border crossings can only partially be attributed to tighter security. The economic crunch in the United States since 2008 has driven many migrants back home , and those who haven't left are staying put. Another factor is the increasingly risky journey faced by migrants travelling through Mexico to the US. Greater control exercised by drug traffickers on the Mexican side along smuggling routes add to the risks. ""The dangerous gauntlet of abuses at the hands of criminal organizations -- and certain Mexican officials -- through which migrants must pass on the way to Mexico's northern border causes some to reconsider the journey,"" according to the report. Some 20,000 migrants, mostly from Central America, are kidnapped every year and countless others are subject to extortion, sexual assault and other abuses, sometimes with the complicity of corrupt Mexican officials. At the same time, the feared spillover into the United States of Mexico's drug-related violence, which has claimed 50,000 lives in the past six years, has not materialized, according to the report. In 2010, El Paso, Texas, across the border from Ciudad Juarez, had the lowest homicide rate of all US cities, with a population of more than 500,000. That same year Ciudad Juarez had one of the highest -- if not the the highest -- homicide rate in the world at 283 homicides per 100,000 people. One reason that violence is not spilling over, the study's authors found, was that Mexican trafficking organizations try to avoid any incident on the US side that could trigger a closure of official border crossings, through which most drugs pass. The report concludes: ""The present moment -- marked by flattening budgets, plummeting migration, and new presidential terms about to begin in both countries -- offers a golden opportunity to pause and reconsider.""

"CentAm Authorities Break Up Massive Migrant Smuggling Ring. Authorities across Central America have dismantled a migrant smuggling network that spanned from Brazil to Mexico, a remarkable sting operation that comes amid heightened US concerns of potential terrorists using these networks to illegally enter the United States. Twenty-nine alleged members of the network were captured in El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama during coordinated raids on June 28 as part of ""Operation Mesoamerica,"" reported Prensa Libre. Guatemalan authorities arrested the alleged ringleader, Luis Leonardo Mejia Pasapera, alias ""Leo,"" along with eight other suspects. Twelve individuals were detained in Panama, five in Honduras, two in Costa Rica, and one in El Salvador, according to Guatemala's Public Ministry (as the Attorney General's Office is known there). One of the leaders of the smuggling network was arrested last week in Brazil. Many of the migrants were of Asian or African nationalities looking for passage into the United States. The trafficking network gathered migrants in Dubai, according to investigators , where they were provided with documentation to enter Brazil. Once in Brazil, the migrants traveled by plane to Colombia before entering Panama by land. The network then smuggled the migrants through Central America, using either Pacific or Atlantic sea routes. When the migrants arrived in Mexico, criminal groups used them as mules to smuggle drugs into the United States, according to Costa Rica's attorney general, Jorge Chavarria. Prensa Libre reported the smuggling ring charged each migrant between $7,000 and $25,000 for the journey. Guatemala's Secretary General of the Public Ministry, Mayra Veliz, said the network was well-organized and capable of smuggling up to 150 migrants at a time. ""It is perhaps the most powerful migrant trafficking organization in the region,"" said Mauricio Boraschi, a prosecutor in Costa Rica investigating organized crime. Veliz said the investigation into the smuggling network began in March 2015 based on information from the US Embassy in Guatemala. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) supported the operation that led to the arrest in El Salvador, reported La Prensa Grafica. Guatemalan authorities said there are still suspected operatives who have yet to be detained. As of now, it is unclear what role US authorities played in either coordinating or assisting in Operation Mesoamerica. The only information that has been reported so far is that the US Embassy in Guatemala alerted local authorities to the existence of the migrant smuggling network in early 2015, and that ICE provided support to the operation in El Salvador. Repeated attempts by InSight Crime to reach the US Embassy in Guatemala's press office were unsuccessful. Some US officials familiar with the issue are concerned migrant smuggling networks may be aiding potential terrorists illegally enter the United States. Under this pretext, the smuggling networks vault from an illegal immigration issue to a national security issue for US authorities. However, almost 15 years after September 11, there is no indication terrorists have illegally entered the United States from Latin America. And evidence of an overarching terrorist-organized crime nexus in the region remains scarce. Although these fears originate from the events of September 11, 2001, there may be heightened attention on this issue now for a couple of reasons. First, the huge influx of Central American migrants into the United States could be making the US southern border increasingly vulnerable. A US border patrol agent told the Arizona Republic last November that he fears criminal groups could smuggle potential terrorists across the border while a distracted US force is busy rounding up and deporting migrants. Second, a high-ranking US official has suggested potential terrorists would prefer entering the US via smuggling networks rather than by legal means. While some US politicians oppose receiving Syrian refugees because they fear terrorists could be camouflaged as asylum-seekers, others say terrorists have quicker and less risky alternatives. ""Frankly, if I came with a clear intent to do harm in this country, I don't think that I would choose the route of entering here and asking for refugee status or asking for refugee status overseas,"" US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske told the Arizona Republic. Finally, such concerns are likely fueled by reports of links between Middle Eastern terrorist groups and Latin American organized crime. There have been periodic warnings over the years about Hezbollah's growing influence in the region, and the threat it poses to the United States, though hard evidence of that threat has not materialized."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"El Salvador Strikes against Death Squads Led by Army, Police. Police and army officials were among those arrested in El Salvador's biggest opperation against anti-gang death squads in recent memory, as the authorities finally move against the deadly militias that have flourished under their noses. On June 21, Salvadoran police arrested four police officers, including one high-ranking official, ten members of the military and 34 civilians accused of forming a network of death squads in various zones in the east of the country, reported EFE. A further five military officials remain at large. Will Ruiz, the head of the anti-organized crime unit at the Attorney General's Office, announced at a press conference that the group stands accused of 36 murders and two attempted murders, one case of deprivation of liberty, and 13 armed robberies. Ruiz told media that the network consisted of two factions that had allied with each other, one dedicated to ""social cleansing"" killings and the other to bank robbery. According to the prosecutor, the mission of the death squad was to ""take justice into their own hands because of the incompetence of the authorities in solving the gang problem that affects the population."" However, while most of their victims were members of the MS13 gang, Ruiz said , among them were also nine people who investigators believe had no ties to gangs at all. In addition, there is evidence in two cases that the group acted as contract killers, taking payment to carry out murders. The network was divided into diverse cells that coordinated to aid each other's operations, Ruiz said. This included using their inside contacts in the police, who provided intelligence and alerts to their death squad comrades, and hindered the operations of their police colleagues. The prosecutor also described the alleged financing of the death squad by people living in the United States. He identified one of these suspected moneymen by the alias ""Willy,"" saying he is wanted on charges of human smuggling and is believed to have fled to the United States. The operation in El Salvador represents the most serious blow yet against a phenomenon that until recently provoked little response from the state, even as the list of its victims grew ever larger. Rumours of anti-gang death squads turned into concrete evidence of ""social cleansing"" killing sprees as far back as 2014. But amid a climate of fear and violence as the gangs declared open war on the security forces, their activities went largely unchecked. The first signs that this could change came with the arrest of six police officers along with several civilians in May 2016. And a group of police was charged in July 2016 with participating in extrajudicial killings. This new wave of arrests now represents a serious stepping up of efforts to combat the death squads and a welcome sign the authorities are finally taking the problem seriously. The alleged activities of the death squad send a clear message about the dangers of letting such vigilantism take hold. Not only do such groups undermine the rule of law, they also inevitably leave innocent victims and will likely slide into criminality, whether in the form taking payment for their killings and robbing banks as in this case, or in other activities such as extorting protection money from the communities they claim to protect."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"What Was Ukraine Drug Trafficker Doing in Mexico?Authorities in Mexico have arrested an alleged member of an Eastern European mafia organization who led a drug trafficking network with links to Asia and Europe, raising questions as to what he was doing in the country and whether he was acting as a broker for international criminal groups. Based on intelligence from US law enforcement, Mexican police agents arrested Ukrainian national Steven Vladyslav Subkys, suspected of running a criminal organization dedicated to laundering money and trafficking arms and drugs in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and the United States, reported Proceso. He was found in an exclusive residential development on the outskirts of Tijuana, Baja California. Subkys had apparently been living in Mexico for several years, allegedly working as a representative for a real estate company while maintaining contacts with the leadership of criminal organizations based in both Europe and Asia, known alternatively as ""organitzatsja,"" ""mafiya,"" or ""bratva."" According to El Mexicano , authorities from the State Public Security Secretariat (SSPE) gave an unofficial account in which they claimed he was wanted by the United States and was a dangerous member of the Russian mafia. Two other men identified as members of Subkys' network were arrested in the same area on March 4. El Mexicano reported that US investigations determined the group operated in New York and engaged in methamphetamine trafficking, automobile theft and the distribution of contraband cigarettes. What little available information there is on Subkys suggests he is a significant player in the international criminal underworld with an influential network of contacts. Sources close to the InSight Crime's partner organization in Europe, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), however, told InSight Crime he was not a well known figure in his homeland, suggesting he has built up this network while living overseas. It is not known if Subkys was in Mexico to buy drugs, meet associates, or simply escape prosecution by US authorities. His potential connections with criminal networks in the Middle East and Asia, however, are interesting, given the growing evidence of ties between Mexico and these regions. Asian mafias are known to have a presence in Baja California, where Tijuana is located. Meanwhile, Latin American criminal groups have been expanding their presence and operations in Asia and the Middle East, and Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel has been seen making particular moves into the Asian drug market. It is possible Subkys was acting as an intermediary, or ""fixer,"" for one or more of these different groups, putting his criminal contacts in touch for the purpose of conducting business on an international level."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Did El Chapo Betray Top Hitman to Mexican Govt?A Mexican investigative news outlet questions whether a recently-arrested top Sinaloa Cartel hitman was handed over by cartel bosses, perhaps in order to uphold a pact to keep violence in the area at a minimum. RioDoce, which covers news in Mexico's Sinaloa state, reports that the recent capture of Jonathan Salas Aviles, alias ""El Fantasma"" (""The Ghost""), may have come about thanks to an agreement with the Sinaloa Cartel. El Fantasma is accused of working as a hitman and bodyguard for the Sinaloa Cartel, and earned his nickname thanks to the precautions he took to protect his identity, according to the report. He had previously evaded capture by authorities twice, including one incident in which he was mistakenly reported to have been killed by the security forces. When he was arrested in Februrary, 200 soldiers and three marine helicopters participated in the operation, trapping him in a house 30 minutes south of Sinaloa capital Culiacan. RioDoce theorizes that the operation -- in which not a single shot was fired -- was actually a surrender negotiated by the Sinaloa Cartel. The publication argues that Sinaloa Cartel leaders Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman and Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada Garcia viewed El Fantasma as a risky employee, as he was being tracked by military intelligence. El Fantasma also had a reputation as a violent and volatile gunman, who terrorized the locals in the small towns outside of Culiacan, beating up civilians and municipal police officers and interrupting private parties while brandishing weapons. Such behavior meant El Mayo received plenty of complaints from local communities about El Fantasma, RioDoce asserts. However, even if El Chapo and El Mayo stopped seeing their top gunman as an asset to the Sinaloa Cartel, this may not have been their only motive for giving him up. A previous report by RioDoce cited a military intelligence document as saying that the Sinaloa Cartel had committed to keeping violent actions in Sinaloa to a minimum, pledging to launch attacks only in response to rivals the Beltran Leyva Organization and the group run by drug trafficker Fausto Isidro Meza Flores, alias ""Chapito Isidro ."" If such an agreement with the authorities is indeed in place, this would also help explain why the Sinaloa Cartel would be so willing to surrender El Fantasma: in order to respect this pact and keep Sinaloa state relatively peaceful. RioDoce's reporting feeds into suspicions that have long surrounded the Sinaloa Cartel: that President Felipe Calderon's administration had some kind of agreement with the criminal organization , allowing the cartel's leaders to operate in peace, while focusing on pursuing its rivals. Calderon's administration always strongly denied such assertions, though some observers -- including NPR, in a 2010 report -- found evidence that, at times, the government appeared to favor the Sinaloa Cartel. The July 2012 military intelligence report seen by RioDoce may further support such theories. According to RioDoce, at no point did the report -- which included a list of recommendations for Calderon and his security cabinet -- mention taking armed action against the Sinaloa Cartel. Instead, the report recommended focusing efforts against smaller criminal organizations like Chapito Isidro's, dubbed ""satellite cells."" These smaller groups are responsible for much of the violence of Mexico, and thus merit particular attention, the briefing reportedly added. Some of RioDoce's interpretations deserve questioning. It is possible that El Fantasma was captured without a single shot fired simply because the security force operation was too overwhelming -- and too quick -- for him to react. Additionally, the July 2012 military briefing was only a list of recommendations: it would be difficult to prove whether the Calderon administration actually decided to follow them, and start pursuing the ""satellite"" criminal groups at the expense of the larger cartels. And, going by RioDoce's reporting, the intelligence briefing does not explicitly state whether the Sinaloa Cartel negotiated its alleged pledge with the military, another branch of the government, or a rival criminal group, casting some doubt on the nature of the pact. Nevertheless, there is plenty of precedent for the Sinaloa Cartel giving up operatives deemed too risky to keep on board. Beltran Leyva Organization leader Alfredo Beltran, captured in 2008, is just one example. It would not be surprising if El Chapo and El Mayo decided to surrender El Fantasma despite his many years of service. However, the question of whether they did so in order to comply with a non-violence pact with the authorities is more difficult to answer."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Net Closing on El Salvador Cartel Leader. Police in El Salvador have rounded up 16 alleged members of the Texis Cartel, in the latest sign that authorities are edging ever closer to cartel kingpin ""El Chepe Diablo."" Among the arrests made in a series of raids in various locations in the east of the country were former congressman Antonio Ascencio and several cattle ranchers, reported La Prensa Grafica. The 16 stand accused of drug trafficking linked to the Texis Cartel and the recently arrested Roberto Herrera, alias ""El Burro,"" who has been formally charged with running a car theft ring but is believed to be a leading Texis Cartel trafficker. Police also raided three ranches and other residences, one of which belonged to Herrera. The arrest of El Burro Herrera marked a breakthrough for the El Salvador authorities in their attempts to crack the Texis Cartel, a key link in the Central America drug trafficking chain, which for years has eluded authorities, mainly thanks to its high-level network of corrupt contacts. Herrera was one of three key figures in the Texis Cartel, along with Juan Umana Samayoa -- the mayor of Metapan, where the organization's power structure is centered -- and Jose Adan Salazar Umana, alias ""El Chepe Diablo,"" -- president of the first division of Salvadoran soccer, and owner of a business empire based around a chain of hotels. Salazar represents the most sought after scalp for the authorities, and with the fall of Herrera and now the recent round of arrests, it appears the Salvadoran authorities have begun to close the circle around him. As with Herrera, if Salazar is captured it will probably be because authorities have managed to build a case not directly related to drug trafficking. The most likely line of investigation prosecutors will take will instead focus on his business dealings and financial crimes. However, as the recent troubles in finding a court to try three more cartel operatives demonstrates, bringing any case to trial will likely prove a stiff challenge in itself. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Convicts Trafficker Chepe Handal on Second Set of Charges. Honduras has convicted a major drug trafficker wanted for extradition by the United States in a second case against him, illustrating the country's resolve to improve the capacity of its judiciary. Jose Miguel Handal Perez, alias ""Chepe Handal,"" and his wife were found guilty of money laundering on August 21, the Attorney General's Office announced in a press release. Proceedings against Jose Miguel's father, Jose Miguel Handal Larach, also known by the alias ""Chepe,"" were closed as the suspect passed away earlier this month. The investigation began in 2015 with a probe into suspicious transactions in US and Honduran bank accounts held by the family. Authorities uncovered more than 52 million lempiras (around $2.2 million) of unjustified deposits. In March of this year, the younger Chepe Handal was condemned to 10 years in prison after having been found guilty of trafficking 1.6 metric tons of cocaine. Chepe Handal was once a major figure in the international drug chain, playing the role of middleman between Colombian groups supplying cocaine and the Mexican Sinaloa and Zetas cartels that handled distribution to the United States, according to US authorities. Operating out of Honduras, he would ensure the smooth transit of drugs through the Central American corridor. In 2013, he became the first high profile Honduran national to be added to the US Treasury Department's ""Kingpin List."" According to La Prensa , Chepe Handal has asked his lawyer to speed up his case for extradition to the United States, which is currently being reviewed by Honduras' Supreme Court. The objective of this move is unclear, however, as his potential extradition would only be carried out after he completed his prison sentence in Honduras. In addition to being the first high profile Honduran added to the Kingpin List, Chepe Handal is representative of the deep links between elites and organized crime in the country. Indeed, the former congressional candidate was long thought to have enjoyed powerful political protection. SEE ALSO : Honduras Elites and Organized Crime The case is also important with regard to Honduras' efforts to build up its judicial institutions. The country has succeeded in delivering serious blows to organized crime in terms of arresting top suspects and seizing assets linked to criminal activities. But Honduran officials have often outsourced prosecutions of these defendants to their US counterparts, reflecting concerns about the weakness of the judicial system. Nevertheless, the successful prosecutions of Chepe Handal shows that the country is making strides toward improving its prosecutorial capacities."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Former Tijuana Cartel Hitmans Memoir Keeps Crime Group in the Background. In ""Confessions of a Cartel Hit Man,"" former Tijuana Cartel enforcer Martin Corona traces his rise through the ranks of the hegemonic crime group during the 1990s, but includes surprisingly few revelations about the organization itself. Corona joined the Arellano Felix organization, also known as the Tijuana Cartel, in the aftermath of its botched 1993 attempt to assassinate Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman at the Guadalajara airport, in which gunmen for the group accidentally murdered a Catholic cardinal, mistaking his car for Guzman's. This was a chaotic time in which the organization had to contend both with international outcry (and the resultant redoubled efforts by law enforcement) and its provoked and emboldened rivals, namely Guzman and Amado Carrillo. Corona was part of the cartel's effort to build its ranks by poaching soldiers from street gangs in southern California, a tactic that calls to mind the Juarez Cartel's reliance on the Barrio Azteca Texas gang street gang for manpower in recent years. Corona provides some granular descriptions of his day-to-day work. He describes spending his days at a command center, ready at a moment's notice to strike out against the cartel's foes. He notes his schedule -- five days on, two days off -- and his pay, a $500 a week regular salary, topped off with irregular but enormous bonuses. He also explains the weapons training they received, and the rules that governed their drug and alcohol consumption. All this amounts to a peek behind the veil of a drug trafficking organization. We see the type of soldiers they recruit, the sorts of conflicts that emerge and the reasons for both Corona's initial enchantment and his subsequent disillusionment (respectively, pride at joining a big crime group and fatigue at the constant murder of victims whose offenses were dubious). This presents an invaluable window into the sort of organization whose operations remain largely a mystery. Nonetheless, the book suffers from its structure. Clocking in at 300 pages of good-sized print, it has just enough space to deliver a comprehensive, infantryman's-eye-view of one of the world's most infamous cartels. But the first 190 pages deal almost entirely with Corona's career as a California gang member engaged in petty pursuits. After a brief description of his tense home life as a Marine brat, the author embarks on a seemingly interminable recitation of his experimentations with a parade of different drugs, women, jails and gangland associates. This portion of the story is not without its appeal. It provides a genuinely thought-provoking portrayal of the process of institutionalization of prison inmates, as well as a first-person account of how the Mexican Mafia exploits its control over the California prison population. But needless to say, for a book whose title purports to provide the mea culpa of a cartel killer, the absence of anything resembling a drug cartel for two thirds of the book is problematic. And what we do see of the Tijuana Cartel seems abbreviated. Nearly a third of that section describes Corona's recruitment and his first mission, the assassination of a rival gunman hiding in San Diego. There is little overarching discussion of the organization's business function, beyond a cursory description of the plaza system. Corona was personally acquainted with Ramon Arellano Felix, but we have little idea of the cartel's founder as a person, which seems a stunning oversight. The book's back cover tells us Corona's testimony was a key factor in the cartel's downfall, which would surely have been interesting if more than a page had been devoted to it. For a book whose title purports to provide the mea culpa of a cartel killer, the absence of anything resembling a drug cartel for two thirds of the book is problematic. Corona's portrayal of his romantic endeavors deserves special mention. Corona introduces us to, among many others, Tiny (""a neighborhood girl, a runaway""), Bonnie (""a crazy girl""), Kahleo (""a knockout body""), Heather (""a really cute white girl""), and Tammy (""a petite blond whose favorite pastime was getting naked at the beach""). Those are just a few of the named characters; there are also two unnamed ladies with whom the author spent a 48-hour stretch in a Southern California hotel room (""I was a porn star""), and a procession of lonely military spouses during a stretch living with his family in Hawaii (""I was going home with a different Marine wife almost every night of the week""). Some readers may find offense at the objectification of the female body, and others may cringe at the clunky language deployed to describe them. Both reactions are understandable. But perhaps a greater problem is the lightness with which Bonnie and Heather and so many others flit in and out of the narrative, typically without any sense of why they are there. The same is true of the scores of homeboys, whose names and nicknames challenge the memory. Similarly, Corona includes long digressions about episodes and people that do not appear to have had any deep impact on his life, nor do they offer any insight into broader criminal dynamics, nor do they have any intrinsic entertainment value. They're just there, which is a poor argument for their inclusion. Perhaps this is a fair representation of a tough kid's conversion into a cartel warrior; for years, Corona ambled along from one scam to the next, growing tougher and smarter along the way, and making a lot of contacts that drifted in and out of his life. His criminal career, such as it was, was more impulse than calculated ambition: He has friends who have access to drugs, which he sells to other friends. Or they have ideas of stealing retail goods, so he tags along and enjoys the booty. Eventually, and somewhat randomly, this brought him into the employ of Ramon Arellano Felix, whose organization was a more coherent entity than the sporadic associations that sustained Corona as a youth. But even if it is a faithful reflection of Corona's life, that doesn't make it any more interesting for the reader. As Corona races through his account of Arellano Felix ranks, one can't help but wonder if the book would have benefited from a more rigorous consideration of exactly what story the book sought to tell, and who really matters to that story."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"How Haiti Successfully Curbed Kidnappings. Until recently, abductions in Haiti were rampant and almost always happened the same way: ski-mask-clad kidnappers would surround a house, force entry, ransack the place and leave with a vulnerable victim -- usually a woman, child or elderly person. The family would pay ransom, and if the victim was released alive, law enforcement would call it a success. That began to change two years ago, after the United Nations introduced anti-kidnapping support led by Robert Arce, a veteran American cop and law enforcement consultant who spent more than three decades on anti-drug, kidnapping and human smuggling units along the US-Mexico border and in Bosnia and Iraq. This article originally appeared on the Inter-American Development Bank's blog Sin Miedos. Read the original here. Thanks to a strategy of cell phone log exploitation, community policing, and some cultural diplomacy, Arce helped Haitian police turn the tide on a limited budget. By the end of 2013, the number of people arrested for kidnapping had nearly quintupled. In the first nine months, police arrested 15 people for kidnapping; in the last three months, the number jumped to 72, and only one new kidnapping was reported, Arce told the Inter-American Development Bank during a phone interview from his home in Phoenix. ""What I encountered was a mess,"" said Arce, who served as a US Department of State anti-kidnapping advisor for Haiti's National Police under the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) from August 2012 to December 2013. ""There was a kidnapping almost every day, and a lot of victims were being killed. The police were demoralized and overwhelmed, and I didn't know where to start."" Even Francois Henry Dossous, chief of the Haitian National Police's anti-kidnapping unit, was on the verge of leaving. But after the new strategies resulted in a few successful stings, Dossous rallied his officers behind the new program, says Arce. The initial plan was to bolster police training and introduce more sophisticated equipment, not solve current cases, but the bureaucratic red tape was endless. Besides, things could take a turn for the worse if equipment like a $300,000 Stingray -- a cell phone triangulation device -- got into the wrong hands. To further complicate matters, Haitian law does not require phone companies to share phone records with law enforcement. In fact, Arce was alarmed to find cops had never asked phone companies to cooperate with investigations, so convincing them to make that request would be key. ""Listen, you go to cell phone companies and I guarantee you they've known someone who's been kidnapped,'"" Arce told his unit. Indeed, just about every phone company executive said they could relate, and most were willing to help, so officers worked with them to create a detailed log of calls tracking the suspects' general vicinity. From there, they could hone in on them by developing neighborhood informants. ""When I started as a rookie cop in 1981, you'd go out and meet everybody in your neighborhood. You'd go fix broken doors and roofs as a way to gain the trust of the community, and they will start calling you with tips,"" Arce explained. ""It was the same in Iraq. You'd partner with the population, live in their neighborhoods, and also partner with the local media."" In Haiti, the first barrier was linguistic. Arce says the United Nations had been recruiting cops from French speaking countries, but realized fewer and fewer Haitians are speaking French. Recruiting Creole speaking police of Haitian origin from Canada and the United States facilitated the communication. Then came the challenge of operating in a tiny, impoverished nation run by powerful elites. ""One of the hurdles we had to overcome was small island politics where people know each other and favors are owed,"" he said. Arce relied on Haitian-American Brunel Bienvenu to execute his plan. The retired New York Police Department officer was well-versed in community policing and at mentoring other officers. He and the unit spent a lot of time talking to locals in target neighborhoods and monitoring Haitian radio and television talk shows to gauge the public's willingness to cooperate in investigations. ""They were fed up with kidnappings,"" said Arce. Cops like Bienvenu harnessed this sentiment to gain community support and convince the media to set up a 24-hour kidnapping tips hotline. ""They were reluctant at first, but saw the positives when they started getting tips,"" said Arce. Maintaining that momentum was the tricky part. For instance, phone companies might have ties to the victims as well as the perpetrators, and nothing stifled morale like the murder of a kidnapping victim. In March 2013, kidnappers abducted and murdered the 12-year-old son of a Haitian pastor who had returned to his homeland with his family after years living abroad to serve the 2010 earthquake victims. The boy's body was found in a ditch with bullet wounds in his head. The incident left Arce and his team totally distraught. ""I shed a tear for that kid,"" said Arce, ""but I told them, 'we're not doing any good if we feel sorry for ourselves.'"" The next day, police jumped into a heavier investigation, which culminated in the arrest of seven people. The public also responded with a tip about where the alleged shooter would be picking up his own eight-year-old from school. Police swooped in and arrested their suspect. The work of the anti-kidnapping unit is one of several law enforcement capacity building programs taking place in Haiti. In fact, the unit is operating under Central Directorate of the Judicial Police (DCPJ) Director Normil Rameau, who spent three years training in Chile. He recently sent some of his top ranking officers to Colombia to train in tactical operations and intelligence gathering and analysis. Arce believes Haiti's law enforcement progress can be furthered with reforms to communications laws and the prison system. He wants investigators to have the ability to subpoena records, and he believes getting prisoners to trial faster would ease discontent in jails. As it stands, most of the alleged kidnappers his team arrested are still being held without trial. The Haitian government is working with the United States Agency for International Development to address both concerns. Arce recently left Haiti to take a full-time job doing similar advising with the US Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs in Northeastern Mexico, but he is confident Haiti is in good hands. ""I left Haiti feeling we'd saved lives,"" Arce said. ""We prevented families from being terrorized. I think someday Haitian school kids will sing folk songs about their country's kidnapping unit."" *Julienne Gage is a communications specialist at the Inter-American Development Bank.

"Drug Gang Shootout Kills 28 in West Mexico. A shootout between rival drug trafficking gangs left at least 28 people dead on a highway near the town of Ruiz in Nayarit, west Mexico. Residents said the shootout began around 4:00 p.m. Wednesday when suspected members of the Zetas encountered members of a rival cartel, according to a report by Milenio. Later reports moved the death toll up to 30. The Mexican Navy took control of the area, while stores closed, leaving the town deserted. The authorities discovered at least ten abandoned vehicles and various weapons , as well as four wounded people. From footage of the scene, many seem to have been dressed in full combat gear. (See XHKG's video report below). Drug violence has shot up in the last year in the Pacific state of Nayarit, which is a center for heroin production. Control of the region has been in flux since the July 2010 death of Sinaloa Cartel head Ignacio ""Nacho"" Coronel Villarreal. Some media reports linked the shootout to the death of a local drug boss called Rogelio Magallanes, alias ""El Chino,"" whose dismembered body was found a week previously. Meanwhile, Mexican authorities attributed the killings to a dispute between the Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas, and said that the Beltran Leyva Organization could also be involved. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Mexico Supreme Court Ruling Pushes Back Against US Kingpin List. Mexico's Supreme Court has declared it unconstitutional to freeze the bank accounts of organized crime suspects without sufficient evidence of wrongdoing, a seeming attempt to push back against the US Treasury Department's recent blacklisting of two Mexican celebrities. On October 4, the Supreme Court announced in a press release that it had ruled article 115 of Mexico's Law on Credit Institutions unconstitutional. The provision allowed financial authorities to freeze the bank accounts of individuals or companies alleged to have links with organized crime. However, the Supreme Court ruled that this practice violates defendants' rights to be presumed innocent and to be guaranteed a fair trial. The ruling follows the August designation of Mexican professional soccer star Rafael Marquez Alvarez and famous Mexican singer Julio Cesar Alvarez Montelongo to the US Treasury Department's ""Kingpin List."" The Treasury Department said the two men ""acted as front persons"" and ""held assets"" for a Mexican drug trafficking organization. Shortly after the US blacklisting, the celebrities' bank accounts in Mexico were frozen. A judge ruled to unfreeze several of Marquez Alvarez's accounts on September 28. Alvarez Montelongo will likely see his accounts unfrozen as a result of the Supreme Court's latest ruling. The Supreme Court's ruling highlights longstanding concerns about the impact of Kingpin List designations, and may be an attempt to partially shield Mexican citizens from some of their effects. The US government says the sanctions are intended ""to deny significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their related businesses, and their operatives access to the US financial system and all trade and transactions involving US companies and individuals."" However, as was seen in the case of Marquez Alvarez and Alvarez Montelongo, Kingpin List designations can have impacts outside the United States as well. The US sanctions are often followed by asset seizures and the freezing of suspects' bank accounts in foreign countries where they may not have been charged or convicted of any crime. Critics say that Kingpin List designations often wrongfully target individuals or entities that haven't committed crimes. Indeed, earlier this year the United States was forced to remove more than 20 businesses and individuals from the list in part due to what one person formerly facing the sanctions called a ""lack of rigor"" in the Treasury Department's evidence gathering."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"GameChangers 2018: Venezuelan Migration a New Gold Mine for Organized Crime. Turbulence reigned in 2018, but there was one constant: the flow of Venezuelans fleeing their country. The unceasing migration has left thousands of people homeless, penniless and ripe for exploitation by organized crime groups. Mariana, a manicurist from the city of Maracaibo, is one example. It took her half a day to cross the border from Venezuela to Colombia. She did not need a passport or any other identification document, nor did she deal with a single immigration official. There weren't even any rivers to cross. All she had to do was pay a little over 20,000 bolivars and 10,000 Colombian pesos (about $34 in May 2018) -- all her savings at the time to reserve one of five seats in a car used by a friend to transport Venezuelans across the border from the state of Zulia via the Colombian town of Paraguachon. The price, a relatively common amount, feeds into a basic migrant smuggling structure operating in the department of La Guajira in Colombia. People from the indigenous Wayuu population run the operation, which illegally brings Venezuelan migrants into Colombia by the thousands. At least 40 of Mariana's relatives now live in the Colombian city of Medellin, and they used the same network to leave Venezuela. The boom in the forced migration of Venezuelans has lasted for more than two years. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimate that approximately three million people have left the country during that time. Most migrants go to Colombia and Brazil, Venezuela's closest neighbors. Others go to Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Argentina, Panama, Mexico and the islands of Curacao, Aruba, and Trinidad and Tobago. Among this massive and uncontrolled exodus, innumerable criminal economies and illicit businesses have emerged. The situation has turned the migrants into a commodity. And a rapidly spreading criminal industry is feeding on them with significant potential to replicate the perilous coyote experience between Central America, Mexico, and the United States. Venezuela has no data estimating the number of migrants who have been smuggled or trafficked. It is also not known how many migrants have been recruited by criminal organizations operating in Colombia as they flee one of the worst crises in Latin America in recent decades. In a recent study on migrant smuggling, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated that at least 2.5 million migrants were victims of smuggling rings worldwide in 2016. Criminal organizations made approximately $7 billion from migrant smuggling. For Venezuelans, the migration business straddles the border. And the first criminal structure citizens must get through is their own government. Corrupt officials operate with intermediaries to exchange bribes and extort money from people who need passports, police background checks, or certifications for their college degrees. They charge exorbitant rates for their services, often offered through the messaging service WhatsApp. Most migrants then leave by land where things get treacherous, especially the corridor known as the Guajira peninsula. The peninsula is shared by both Colombia (La Guajira department) and Venezuela (Zulia state). On the Colombian side , human smuggling is dominated by ""Los Guajiros,"" as the Wayuu people in the area are often called. They impose their own tariffs to allow the movement of vehicles transporting migrants into Colombia through their territory. They also maintain a fleet of vehicles and up to 10 checkpoints on each of the more than 200 ""trochas"" or improvised roads that connect the two countries. To be able to cross, drivers must make payments at each control point, with the price varying constantly. Migrants or independent transporters who try to best this system not only expose themselves to robbery, abuse and sexual abuse, but also put their lives at risk. Reports of migrant smuggling operations are growing along Venezuela's border with Brazil as well, where the networks are run by both Brazilians and Venezuelans. Other costs and dangers await migrants who go by sea. On the Venezuelan coast closest to Curacao, Aruba, and Trinidad and Tobago, different modes of human smuggling have been discovered, such as using small fishing boats to transport Venezuelans to the islands, a trip such boats are unfit to make. The cost for the dangerous crossing is $350, slightly more than a plane ticket for the same trajectory. Up to 20 people board the boats at a time. So far, there are few details on how the groups running the trips are organized or how they operate, but the frequent shipwrecks and arrests of the so-called ""balseros venezolanos,"" or Venezuelan rafters, indicate that it could be a growing industry. The Hungry and the Enslaved Poverty, hunger and limited access to health services and medicine have been the engine driving the mass migration of Venezuelans, and it is only accelerating. In 2017, 87 percent of the Venezuelan population was living in poverty , according to the National Survey of Living Conditions of the Venezuelan Population (Encuesta Nacional de Condiciones de Vida de la Poblacion Venezolana - ENCOVI), making it easier for criminal organizations to exploit them. Most notably, Venezuelans often become victims of modern slavery and its various incarnations, such as sexual and labor exploitation. In 2018, Venezuelan non-governmental organization Paz Activa reported that there had been 198,800 victims of human trafficking as of 2017 in its publication Human Trafficking, Forced Labor and Slavery (Trata de Personas, Trabajo Forzoso y Esclavitud). Paz Activa has further warned that the figure could reach 600,000 in 2019. The United States singled out Venezuela as a country that is not making any effort to combat human trafficking and to protect victims. Meanwhile, Colombian authorities say that human trafficking has increased along with Venezuelan migration. This year, dozens of human trafficking, sexual exploitation and forced labor networks that specifically target Venezuelan migrants have been dismantled from Colombia , Peru , Panama , and Mexico , to the Dominican Republic and numerous countries in Europe. In Colombia's capital city of Bogota, 75 percent of reported trafficking victims are from Venezuela. And in smaller cities like Cartagena, Barranquilla and Armenia -- the capital of Quindio department in the heart of the country's famed coffee region -- authorities have dismantled smaller networks of sexual slavery and forced labor. They also estimate that in Cucuta, capital of the department of Norte de Santander and a major migration gateway, there are more than 2,000 Venezuelan prostitutes, so many that prices have been driven down to as little as 10,000 Colombian pesos (approximately $3.50) for their services. Criminal groups operating in Colombia are also taking advantage of the humanitarian crisis. Authorities in Norte de Santander told InSight Crime that all of the country's armed groups are currently recruiting Venezuelans : The National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN), the dissidents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), the Rastrojos and the Urabenos all use them for different functions .The non-governmental organization the Foundation Networks (Fundacion Redes) said in its latest report that Venezuelans make up some 60 percent of these groups. Moreover, InSight Crime learned that Venezuelans have been replacing Colombian raspachines -- people who harvest coca leaves -- because they charge less. ""Most of the people caught up in these criminal groups are young and desperate to earn money to help their families in Venezuela,"" said David Smolansky, the former mayor of the Venezuelan town of El Hatillo who is currently living in exile. Smolansky coordinates a working group on Venezuelan migrants, which the Organization of American States (OAS) created this year. Monthly salaries when working for these criminal groups range from $100 to $300 , an income that would be almost impossible to earn in Venezuela at the moment. But Venezuelans face dangers when working with such groups. In June, a bombing operation conducted by the Colombian army against a dissident FARC camp in Arauca department killed four Venezuelans, including two women. Informal and Criminal Economies Cucuta is the principal corridor along the expansive border Colombia and Venezuela share. Some 40,000 Venezuelans pass through the city each day. Waves of people lug suitcases and balance packages on their shoulders as they flow into a prolific informal economy. Here, everything from cellular phones to ""canaimitas"" (laptops the Venezuelan government distributes to its schools) to even hair can be bought or sold. The market for hair is particularly vibrant. As soon as they set foot on Colombian soil, Venezuelans can sell their locks for up to 100,000 Colombian pesos, which is approximately $30. In Venezuela, this amount equates to five months' worth of minimum-wage income. The hair is used to make natural extensions that are then sold online for up to $200. This passageway is just the first step in what is fast becoming a major corridor of migration-based organized crime. InSight Crime sources stated that a prostitution structure operates at that very point in the border, luring young women and children from the moment they arrive at the Colombian side of the Simon Bolivar bridge. They are temporarily housed in tractor-trailers, then transported to different departments throughout Colombia. Some even make it to Panama. While it could not be confirmed through fieldwork, various regions of Colombia are notorious for having a large presence of sex workers who come from Venezuela. Cases of the sexual exploitation of Venezuelan children have also been reported in tourism enclaves like Cartagena and Santa Marta. Borders Closed, Criminal Floodgates Open The situation that has grown up around the Venezuelan migration has begun to significantly impact the greater region. In 2018, Latin American governments held at least two summits specifically to find a solution to the problem. The crisis is also one more on a growing list of issues tied to the already complicated migration situation affecting Central America, Mexico, and the United States. Despite the meetings and other efforts, leaders from across the continent seem to have no effective means of tackling this crisis. Instead, the immediate reaction from many of them has been to close their countries' borders in an attempt to squelch the growing migratory flows. US President Donald Trump is one of the strongest advocates for that option, having proposed numerous strategies to essentially shut down the border between the United States and Mexico. Others in the region seem keen to follow his example or use it as cover for their own callous policies. Yet, when borders are closed, migrants do not stop in their tracks; they tend to shift to more dangerous routes. And these routes are usually controlled by organized crime, thanks, in part, to chains of corruption and collusion with local authorities and security forces. For example, Central American migrants traveling through Mexico have found themselves in the hands of organized crime groups, which are charging more for their services as Trump ramps up efforts to beef up the border. Smuggling Venezuelans is not yet as lucrative since the Venezuelan passport still allows for legal, visa-free entry to most countries in the region. Despite hard-line responses, migration levels are not decreasing. And little has been done to tackle the reasons driving people away from their homes in Central America, Venezuela and elsewhere, such as high homicide rates , corruption, and inefficient governments. Venezuela's descent into crisis has largely spurred the mass migration. According to estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), inflation could top one million percent by the end of 2018, and the country's gross domestic product (GDP) could plummet by 18 percent. The UN reports the number of Venezuelan migrants could skyrocket to 5.3 million in 2019. This increase will only fuel the market for criminal groups seeking to benefit from them, while also putting further strain on governments already incapable or unwilling to end the corruption and collusion that allow the same groups to function. All this makes it unlikely that the situation will improve in the foreseeable future, except, of course, for organized crime.

"Colombia Govt Will Not Negotiate With BACRIM: Minister. Colombia's defense minister recently said that the criminal groups descended from right-wing paramilitary organizations should expect no formal demobilization process, reigniting a long-simmering debate in the country. Defense Minister Luis Villegas made the comments about Colombia's criminal bands -- which the government refers to as BACRIM -- during an April 13 military ceremony, reported Vanguardia. ""[The BACRIM] are organized crime and that's how they'll be treated,"" he said. ""They'll be no political deals for big or small groups. There will only be encounters with the armed forces and paying their dues before justice."" The minister also implied that the government would not create a special legal framework to encourage BACRIM members to disarm, as the government did in 2005 for right-wing paramilitary groups with the Justice and Peace Law. ""If [the BACRIM] want to submit themselves to justice, the laws and offices are there to receive them,"" he said. The demobilization of Colombia's paramilitary groups in the mid-2000s has come under strong criticism for its shortcomings, so it is no surprise that officials like Villegas are wary of treating the BACRIM similarly to the paramilitaries under Colombian law. Indeed, the BACRIM formed out of remnant paramilitary factions that did not fully disarm. Nevertheless, there has been previous discussion of offering BACRIM members certain benefits to encourage them to cooperate with police and prosecutors. There has already been one prominent example of a BACRIM surrendering en masse to the government , although the process did not go smoothly. The most prominent BACRIM that has been pushing for inclusion in a demobilization process is the Urabenos, currently believed to be the most powerful drug trafficking organization in the country. At the moment, the Urabenos are present in 22 of Colombia's 32 departments, according to the government. The Urabenos originally emerged from the remnants of demobilized paramilitary factions in 2008. This helps explain why the group is trying to present itself as a political actor in Colombia's conflict, and hence worthy of inclusion in a demobilization process. But as Villegas made clear, the government is far from convinced. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Guatemalan Drug Lord to be Extradited to US. Guatemalan drug boss Walther Overdick will be extradited to the United States, highlighting the role of extradition in the Central American country's weak justice system. On June 13, a Guatemalan court approved the extradition of Horst Walther Overdick , alias ""the Tiger,"" to the United States. Overdick (pictured), a high-profile drug lord with close ties to the Zetas and the Lorenzanas , was arrested in April. Guatemalan judges have determined that Overdick was responsible for overseeing large shipments of cocaine to the US. The courts also believe that Overdick helped facilitate cocaine trafficking in Guatemala by building clandestine runways and by storing the drugs in warehouses. Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez has said that Overdick was a fundamental facilitator of the Zetas' expansion into Guatemala. Overdick is believed to have provided the cartel with the logistics necessary to operate in the Central American country. The extradition was requested by the New York Southern District Court, which charges that Overdick helped ship 2,650 lbs. of cocaine to the US in 2002. Extradition plays an important role in the Guatemalan justice system, largely due to the weakness of the courts, which struggle with widespread corruption and impunity. Less than four percent of all cases in the country are prosecuted. Over the past five years, the United Nations' International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) has been working with the government to implement serious reforms -- an uphill battle, according to CICIG director Francisco Dall'Anese. Guatemala's top criminals rarely face charges in their own country, and those who are prosecuted are seemingly immune from justice. In 2011, ex-president Alfonso Portillo was tried by national courts for money laundering and embezzlement. In a representative case of the weakness of the Guatemalan justice system, Portillo was acquitted of all charges , despite strong evidence against him, and instead faced extradition to the US. This is a frequent occurrence in Guatemala, in which the failing court system must rely on extradition to ensure the successful prosecution of criminals. Although some advocate for reform of the extradition process , which is full of loopholes that delay extradition cases , others argue that extradition avoids addressing the fundamental weakness of the Guatemalan justice system.

"Sentenced Without Conviction: A Tale of Pretrial Detention in Colombia. On April 3, 2014, a dozen plainclothes police officers crashed through the door of Norbert Reinhart's Medellin apartment brandishing an arrest warrant for murder. Over three years later, and Reinhart is neither a free man nor a convicted criminal, instead he is one of tens of thousands of inmates in Colombian prisons trapped in the legal limbo of pretrial detention. In Colombia, as in much of Latin America, the overuse of pretrial detention has fueled an overcrowding crisis: Colombia's prisons stand at 154 percent of their capacity, and around a third of inmates are on remand. Authorities struggle to maintain control of these jails' tens of thousands of prisoners, a significant number of whom are innocent or only guilty of minor crimes. Inmates routinely endure prolonged physical and mental suffering as well as exposure to hardened convicts and organized crime networks. In July 2017, a legal reform came into effect designed to ease overcrowding by imposing new time limits on the use of pretrial detention. But as Norbert Reinhart was to discover, the gap between the law and its application in Colombia may limit its impact. For Reinhart, a 65-year-old Canadian citizen who has lived in Colombia for over 20 years, his ordeal began in the holding cells of Colombia's judicial police ( Seccional de Investigacion Criminal - SIJIN). Two days after his arrest, he was cuffed and escorted to the court room for his indictment, legalization of capture and security measures hearings, which all flashed by in a five-hour blur. At the hearings, Reinhart heard how he was accused of paying a paramilitary hitman to murder one of his business partners in a mining venture -- charges he vigorously denies -- and how he would be held on remand throughout his trial. Guidance issued to prosecutors states that incarceration should always be the last resort for pretrial security measures, but in reality, it is usually the first resort. In Reinhart's case, the prosecutor argued the circumstances met the three requirements for showing proportionality for such measures: he was deemed a flight risk as he was a foreign citizen, a risk to the victims or the community as it was a murder case involving organized crime, and a risk of interfering with the case, as he had illegally been in possession of investigation files related to the case at the time of his arrest. However, the process, Reinhart claims, was a done deal from the start and he had little opportunity to contest the security measures or the accusations they were based on. ""It was like a rubber stamp,"" he told InSight Crime during a visit to El Pedregal prison on the outskirts of Medellin. Fearing he would be cut off from the outside world once he entered the actual prison system, Reinhart bribed the SIJIN guards to let him stay in the holding cells for 30 days to give him time to find a lawyer and, he believed, to secure his release. ""I thought I could solve this in 30 days, I thought it was that obvious I was innocent, that this was a mistake,"" he said. After 20 days, and with the gravity of his situation sinking in, he was hauled out of the SIJIN cells and transported up the Medellin mountainside to the grim concrete tower blocks of El Pedregal. On arrival, Reinhart was taken to a reception area consisting of three tiny cells and a small open area. The area was packed wall to wall with other prisoners, who slept in whatever space they could find on whatever bedding they had brought with them. Reinhart had a thin camping mat his partner's wife had got to him in the SIJIN cells, but he was forced to spend several nights sleeping on the floor, wet from the overflowing urinals. Reinhart was only in reception for one week, making him one of the lucky ones. Other inmates he knows have spent close to a year and a half in the reception area waiting to be assigned a cell. As an elderly man, Reinhart was assigned to Patio F -- the wing reserved for vulnerable prisoners, such as people with physical disabilities, members of at-risk minorities such as the LGBT community, and public officials. This was another stroke of luck as the common patios are rife with violence and crime, and brutally controlled by bosses known in the Colombian prison system as ""caciques"" or chieftains. ""It's pure hell"" in the other wings, he said. ""Every day I count my blessings, because I wouldn't last three days in there."" Nevertheless, while Reinhart has been spared the violent regime of the caciques, conditions in Patio F are no better than in the rest of the crumbling concrete shell of El Pedregal, and he feels his three years there have already taken their toll. ""It's an environment where, by necessity, your mental and physical health has to deteriorate, it leaves you mentally debilitated,"" he said. Guidance issued to prosecutors states that incarceration should always be the last resort for pretrial security measures, but in reality, it is usually the first resort. Under Colombian law, inmates on remand are supposed to be kept separate from the convicted to protect them from being victimized or recruited by hardened criminals. However, in El Pedregal, as in most Colombian prisons, this never happens, and every wing is a mix -- among Reinhart's current cellmates is a convicted hitman. ""The condemned people are much more involved in extortion and threatening behaviour,"" he said. ""They say I'm condemned, I've got nothing to lose, I'll kill you."" Many of those who enter the prison, innocent or guilty, will end up with drug problems. Reinhart estimates that 30 to 40 percent of people in his wing use drugs, but this rises to a staggering 80 to 90 percent in the common wings, generating large numbers of addicts. As a result, drug debts are the principal cause of violence. ""There is so much need, but so much poverty,"" Reinhart said. The drugs offer one of the only escapes from the tedium of prison life. But one of the few other breaks in routine, attending the endless court hearings, is less a relief than another ordeal, Reinhart says. The arduous processing and transportation process is compounded by eight- to ten-hour stints crammed into the court house's small holding cell with over 40 other inmates and no furniture. However, Reinhart adds, these trips have a silver lining. ""The only sunlight I've seen in three years is walking from the door to the bus,"" he said. Presumed Innocent, Treated Guilty Even after settling into El Pedregal, Reinhart still believed he would be out of prison within six months. However, as his case progressed he began to understand the reality of the Colombian justice system: its glacial pace, endless delays, strange maneuvers and at times baffling interpretation of the laws. By the time his trial started, nearly 22 months after his arrest, Reinhart's pretrial detention had exerted a chokehold not only over his own life but also over his young daughter's. It was the day after her 18th birthday when Molly Reinhart received an email saying her father was in jail. At first, she stayed in Canada, trusting his assurances that the case would be rapidly resolved. However, on New Year's Day 2015, she found herself on a plane to Colombia. Since arriving, Molly's time has revolved around organizing her father's defense, while the rest of her life has been put on hold. ""The most difficult thing the whole time is not knowing how long,"" she said. ""I haven't been able to make plans for the past three and half years."" With no end in sight, her family, friends and life in Canada have receded into the past. ""My mom's been the only one to say, 'You should come back.' But it's not that simple. I can't just leave,"" she said. As the trial dragged on, Reinhart, his daughter and his lawyer filed numerous motions to try to secure his release for the trial period, all of which were rejected. However, with the new law coming into effect, they believed they finally had a watertight case. Law 1786 changes the previously vague condition that defendants could only be held for a ""reasonable term"" with specific time limits. Defense lawyers can apply for release under one of two types of time limits. The first sets a limit of one year for the whole process, with the possibility for prosecutors applying to extend to two for certain types of cases such as those involving multiple charges or organized crime. The other sets limits for each stage of the trial: 60 days from the indictment to the presentation of the written accusation, 120 days from the accusation to the start of the oral trial, and 150 days for the trial itself, with each term doubled for the special cases. At the July 19 hearing, Reinhart's lawyer made a simple case. As his is an organized crime case, the 150-day limit for the trial doubles to 300. He has been held for 530 days, although he drops this to 480 days after discounting delays for which Reinhart and his legal team accept they were responsible. Whichever way you look at it, the defense argued, the terms have long expired. The prosecutor responded with a barrage of arguments: the law should not be retroactively applied, it is not supposed to be automatically applied, Reinhart has been planning this all along, delaying and delaying until he can get out and escape to Canada. Both lawyers play on the arguments that swirl around pretrial detention and the law to curb its use. ""It is possible that some people who have committed crimes will be set free, but right now there are a lot of innocent people unjustly serving sentences,"" the defense argued. ""The legislators cannot want the chaos of a mass release!"" the prosecutor batted back. ""The state has to assume responsibility for its actions."" The judge ruled that Reinhart will stay in prison. He stated the law cannot be applied retroactively, arguing that instead the count started when the law came into force, a decision that seemingly flies in the face of the national Prosecutor's Office's own interpretations of the law and, Reinhart's defense argues, constitutional law. For the judge, law 1786 does not apply to the case and Reinhart has not yet spent an unreasonable amount of time in prison. They will appeal, but in the meantime the trial continues. The prosecution is expected to conclude in August, meaning some time before the end of the year Reinhart will finally get a chance to present his defense -- over three and half years after his arrest. The arguments over his guilt or innocence will almost certainly drag on into 2018. But for the time being, he, along with tens of thousands of other presumed innocents in Colombia, continues to live as a condemned man."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Calderon Clashes with Mexican Governors over Unrealistic Police Reform. A dispute between President Felipe Calderon and Mexico 's governors over the pace of the vetting of state police forces reflects the nation's difficulties in carrying out effective, lasting police reform. Addressing the nation's governors at a meeting of the National Public Security System, Calderon said that he ""implored [them], while also offering the support of the federal government, to bring the evaluation of the middle and high commands, as well as half of the state's operational and municipal officers, to completion by May next year at the latest."" Calderon's government has shown some aggressiveness in removing incompetent or dishonest officials in the security agencies at the federal level. As InSight Crime noted in August, the nation's attorney general, Marisela Morales, has embarked on a significant housecleaning during her six months on the job. More than 1,000 employees of the PGR, the department she heads, have been either fired, arrested, or investigated during her tenure. Twenty-one of the 31 state PGR heads resigned in August to protest the mass firings. The governors responded that the vetting process, set forth in a national security law that came into effect in 2009, is not due to be completed until 2013. Guerrero Governor Angel Aguirre also objected to what he suggested were the unrealistic aims of the Calderon government. ""I think that the governors would like to have police 100 percent certified,"" he said. ""Nonetheless, our reality is otherwise, let's not aspire to have police forces like Switzerland or such advanced countries."" Both sides of the dispute err in their arguments. The governors, for instance, ignore the fact that they are carrying out the vetting at a snail's pace. According to a study from the National Public Security System , released in February 2011, just 8 percent of the state police officers have passed through a vetting process, while states collectively spend just two-thirds of their total security budget allocation. Given these statistics, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the state governments are not doing everything possible to improve the police under their control as quickly as possible. Furthermore, while the gap between the average advanced country's police and Mexico's is yawning, the sense of fatalism displayed by Aguirre is disheartening; revolutionizing a police system consisting of thousands of different institutions is a daunting prospect, but shouldn't Mexico at least aspire to have world-class police forces? Calderon's position is motivated in part by the fact that Mexican governors typically respond to increases in violence with pleas to the federal government to deploy troops; this has been the tactic of, among others, Andres Grenier in Tabasco , and Zeferino Torreblanca in Guerrero. Stronger state police agencies would alleviate the strain on federal resources, allow them to concentrate their efforts more selectively, and could also allow the military to withdraw to a more supportive role. Furthermore, Calderon has long sought a police reform that would consolidate the nation's more than 2,000 municipal police departments into just 32 state bodies. Such a reform would make the integrity of the state institutions all the more important. But Calderon's position is also flawed. He implies that the vetting process simply needs to be brought to a finish, and then the state governments will all enjoy clean, competent police force. Unfortunately, there is no reason to believe this. Past police purges have not served as a long-term solution to corruption in Mexican security agencies, and it is not likely that this one will be any different. Those police who remain after the vetting are not universally incorruptible; many of them have simply not been confronted with the dilemma. But if a criminal group loses all their local police protectors, logic dictates that they will seek to replace them. No matter the efficiency and thoroughness of the housecleaning, the gains will be only temporary. Calderon's comments reflect a linear conception of vetting, but the gangs are dynamic and adaptable, and the logic of corruption is cyclical. What is needed is not a one-off housecleaning, but rather the creation of strong, permanent anti-corruption institutions: well funded internal affairs bureaus at every level of the police, continual random drug and polygraph testing, perennial asset-monitoring, and the like.

Does Leaders Death Mark Demise of Paraguay Guerrilla Group?The killing of one of the founding members of the ACA guerrillas could spell the end for Paraguay's breakaway rebels and their alleged plan to tap into the country's drug trade wealth. On the night of January 5, members of Paraguay's anti-guerrilla Joint Task Force (FTC) opened fire on a group of Armed Peasant Association (ACA) guerrillas, killing leader and founder Albino Jara Larrea along with a teenage girl. Police sources told ABC they had been patrolling the region for several days before finding the rebels -- who are a splinter group of the larger Paraguayan People's Army (EPP) -- in a rural area to the east of the city of Concepcion. Authorities told ABC Jara had been armed with an AK-47 at the time of the shooting, while a local prosecutor told Ultima Hora he was also carrying over $10,000 in Paraguayan guaranies and a number of cell phones and memory cards. With an estimated five or six guerrillas accompanying Jara, some of whom security forces say may have been injured in the attack, the FTC has announced that it will continue to hunt down the remaining ACA members, reported Ultima Hora. The ACA is a new armed group believed to have been founded last year by Jara and his brother Alfredo, both of whom are former EPP fighters. FTC sources told InSight Crime the pair had been a disruptive influence in the EPP due to their lack of discipline and predilections for drinking and womanizing. They likely set up their own dissident group after securing over $230,000 in ransom money from the kidnapping of a businessman. Initially the group was believed to number fewer than 15 fighters, and Paraguay's anti-drug agency said they had set their sights on growing by funding themselves through the local drug trade -- Paraguay is South America's largest marijuana producer and a major cocaine transit country. However, even before the killing of Jara, the ACA had suffered a major setback when security forces killed five fighters in September last year. The group is now likely to amount to little more a handful of fighters -- some of whom may be wounded -- led by Jara's brother Alfredo and is unlikely to pose a serious security threat in the future. Short of a miraculous turnaround, their options now appear limited to pleading to reintegrate into the EPP, turning themselves in, or fighting to the bitter end. Meanwhile, the FTC has been unable to take down the EPP, thanks in part to the guerrilla group's network of local collaborators, which provides intelligence information and support. The EPP managed to keep kidnapping victim Arlan Fick hostage for close to nine months while the FTC unsuccessfully searched for the teenager, who was released in December .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Global Peace Index Provides Questionable View of LatAm Security. A recent report ranking levels of peace around the world rates most Latin American countries as having medium or high levels of peace, a finding that stands in sharp contrast to the high rates of homicide and violent crime plaguing the region. According to the 2014 Global Peace Index (GPI) -- which ranked 162 countries based on indicators measuring domestic and international conflict, safety and security, and level of militarization -- Colombia and Mexico are the only countries in Latin America with low levels of peace. The report listed Colombia as number 150 on a list ranging from most to least peaceful, four places below its 2013 ranking. The second worst classification in the region was given to Mexico (138), followed by Venezuela (129), Peru (119), Honduras (117), El Salvador (116) and Guatemala (115). Of these countries, only Honduras improved its ranking between 2013 and 2014. Mexico was one of the ten countries in the world to see the largest negative change in its GPI since 2008. The report also states that despite the amount of money spent on violence containment in Colombia and Mexico -- amounting to 9.7 and 9.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) respectively -- in both countries the state's capacity to deal with crime is insufficient, partly because of widespread corruption. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's (UNODC) 2013 Global Study on Homicide ( pdf ), the Americas as a region had the highest homicide rate in the world in 2012, with 16.3 murders per 100,000 people. This murder rate contrasts sharply with the results of the GPI, which describe levels of peace in Central America and the Caribbean as being only ""slightly below"" the world average. On a national level, the GPI of several Latin American countries also diverges from other indicators. Whereas Colombia's murder rate was 30.8 per 100,000 in 2012, Venezuela registered 53.7 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants and Honduras reported 90.4, but both countries were ranked as more peaceful on the GPI. Similarly, although the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are plagued by gang violence and the region was classified by the UN as the most violent in the world in 2012 and 2013, it was ranked as being more peaceful than Peru, where the Shining Path rebel group poses a much weaker threat to the country as a whole. While the protracted conflict in Colombia and ongoing warring between drug cartels in Mexico make their rankings unsurprising, it seems the GPI is not an accurate reflection of the actual experiences of insecurity faced by the citizenry of many Latin American nations. This points to the difficulty of applying indicators in a blanket fashion to measure a concept as complex as ""peace."""	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Nearly 200 Guatemalan Police Removed for Criminal Ties in 2012. The Guatemalan police purged 194 officers from its ranks for their criminal activities in 2012, and has fired 22 more so far in 2013, highlighting the extent of criminal infiltration in the National Police Force (PNC). Among the Guatemalan police officers detained last year were five agents arrested for smuggling meth precursor chemicals , 11 for an attempted kidnapping , and 19 officers accused of kidnapping and money laundering , among other charges. The authorities say all 194 officers will face trial, reported Prensa Libre. The officers were removed as part of the police anti-corruption measures being pushed by President Otto Perez Molina's administration. The Commission for Police Reform is primarily responsible for overseeing the clean-up, now relying on a staff of 89 officers trained to perform internal inspections within the police. Government Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla said that the government aims continue reform efforts in the coming year by increasing personnel levels, providing officers with better equipment, and encouraging the reporting of irregular activities within the force. The firing of the corrupt officers has been complimented by ongoing efforts to expand Guatemala's police. Mid-February saw 1,617 officers graduate from the Guatemala City police academy. Vice President Roxana Baldetti noted during the ceremony that another 4,000 are set to graduate between August and December 2013. All new graduates of the National Civil Police Academy must pass confidence tests. The government's plan also aims to improve efforts to tackle organized crime through reassessing where police are deployed. Assistant Security Minister Edi Juarez has said that the government has already determined which areas of the country are most in need of a larger police presence. Some of the most recent graduates will be placed in regions worst affected by the drug trade, organized crime and violence, including Peten, Escuintla, Quetzaltenango, Huehuetenango, and San Marcos. Police reform is clearly essential to improving security in a country with one of the highest homicide rates in the region, and is a purported objective of Perez Molina's presidency. The government opened a new police training school in August 2012 and, shortly afterwards, announced plans to track police officers with micro-chips , in order to better monitor any suspicious movements by corrupt agents. However, as think-tank the International Crisis Group outlined in a report last year , Perez's deep-rooted military ties may serve as an obstacle to police reform, increasing the possibility that he will rely heavily on the military for security and thus undermine efforts to clean up the police. Another concern is that as Guatemala continues to fire corrupt officers and train new ones, the force could face a shortage of equipment. Siglo 21 reported that following the recent graduation of newly trained officers, the government is now short 5,000 weapons for the police force. The government experienced the same problem last year when a class of officers graduated in August, one indication that resource shortages are a continuing constraint.	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"Why Is Latin America So Corrupt?The annual release of the global Corruption Perceptions Index is rarely good news for Latin America. Except for a handful of standout nations, the region consistently performs poorly, with all but six mainland Latin American countries appearing in the bottom half of the table this year. But what do the 18 years of the index tell us about the state of corruption in Latin America? Published every year since 1995 by NGO Transparency International, the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) compiles results from independent surveys by NGOs to estimate how corrupt the public sectors of different countries are. Over the years the CPI has grown in scope, originally ranking 41 nations but in 2013 including 177. In a 2012 independent assessment of Transparency International's methodology ( pdf download ), the European Commission concluded the CPI was ""appealing for reasons of transparency and replicability, it is also conceptually and statistically coherent and with a balanced structure,"" as well as saying, ""the CPI can efficiently differentiate the level of corruption between countries, unlike some sources where a large number of countries is assessed at the same level of corruption."" While the concept of assessing perceptions comes with its own pitfalls, according to Transparency International's Regional Coordinator for the Americas Max Heywood it's the best method available, given the difficulty of assessing corruption itself. ""Methodologically it's practically impossible to measure actual cases of corruption,"" explains Heywood. ""You could do things that look at judicial cases but then what it possibly could just mean is that you have an effective justice system that's being very active against corruption."" According to Heywood, the accuracy of the CPI is outlined by the fact many of the trends match patterns seen in other studies, such as those of the Global Corruption Barometer , a study of citizen's corruption perceptions produced every two years by Transparency International. Since 1995, Latin America's inclusion has risen from six nations to all mainland countries except Belize, as well as the most populated and some smaller Caribbean nations. For the purpose of this regional overview, InSight Crime compiled the historical results of all countries in North, South and Central America, as well as all Caribbean nations and territories with a population exceeding one million (see table). For comparison, the rating system used up to 2011 -- with a maximum score of ten -- has been converted to the current system, with a maximum score of 100. Overall the table highlights remarkable continuity throughout the region, which -- given the low scores -- essentially marks a failure to effectively address corruption over almost two decades. One of the most notable changes is the rise of Uruguay from the middle of the region's pack when it first appeared in 1997, to Latin America's best performer, now on par with the United States. The country's rating leapt up in 2006 -- the year after the left-leaning Frente Amplio coalition swept to power -- and has continued to rise almost every year since. The Frente Amplio is generally seen as a transparent political machine , gaining the trust of the people to the point that it has recently managed to push through policies and legislation the majority of citizens are opposed to , yet still remain the front runner for elections next year. A similar, albeit less profound, shift is notable in Ecuador, which has registered year-on-year improvements since 2008 -- the year after incumbent President Rafael Correa came to power. While its current score of 35 still points to endemic corruption, Correa brought an end to a period of flux which saw seven presidents lead the country in just ten years. When analyzing what sets apart the Latin American countries that have consistently sat atop the regional chart -- namely Uruguay, Chile and Costa Rica -- a notable pattern is the relative absence of organized crime compared to elsewhere in the region. While there have been signs that dynamic is changing, particularly in Chile and Costa Rica , none of them have traditionally been drug producing or exporting nations and only Costa Rica -- almost always the lowest of the three -- has historically witnessed significant drug transiting, as product passes through from South America on its way towards the United States. The relationship between organized crime and corruption is impossible to overstate and goes some way towards explaining why Latin America's corruption ratings have largely remained static. Without corrupt officials facilitating its activities, organized crime would not be able to survive. Due to its geographical location, Central America, home to some of the CPI's worst performers in the region, is a hub of drug trafficking and beset by criminal groups. In the face of weak economies and state institutions, drug trafficking organizations have historically acted with impunity to transport contraband through the isthmus, buying the loyalty of underpaid officials along the way. Even access to significant funding seemingly offers no remedy to corruption, as demonstrated by the cases of Mexico and Colombia -- mainland Latin America's major beneficiaries of US aid. Despite receiving billions of dollars in assistance since the turn of the century, neither has seen a significant change in its corruption rating since the CPI began. With much of that aid directed at combatting the groups responsible for the drug flow, the failure to see a marked change in corruption is perhaps an illustration of what many commentators have begun to call the "" failure of the 'war on drugs.'"" However, while organized crime undoubtedly plays a significant part, it would be naive to ignore the role of history in the region's corruption landscape. Built on political systems skewed towards the needs of powerful oligarchies, which in many places continue to wield significant economic and political power today, corruption has permeated the region far longer than the drugs trade and would likely persist even in the face of organized crime's demise."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Do El Salvador Killings Reflect Danger to the Gangland Truce?Two local bosses of the Mara Salvatrucha gang have been killed by their underlings in El Salvador offering a glimpse at the tensions underlying the criminal pact that has precipitated a dramatic reduction in violence this year. As the newspaper El Diario de Hoy has reported , two alleged commanders of Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, were murdered August 20 in Soyapango, a sizeable suburb of San Salvador, the nation's capital. According to authorities, the two men were killed inside a house used by the gang, and the way that the murders were carried out suggests that other members of the same gang were behind the killings. The pair of victims, identified only by their nicknames ""Truki"" and ""Nixon"", had long criminal backgrounds, and in fact had been arrested earlier this month for ""belonging to gangs"". However, they were released days later. Authorities told reporters that internal disputes over the truce between two principal gangs in El Salvador ( Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18 ), which has prevailed for the past five months, was behind the dispute. The language of the report is not clear-cut, but it suggests that the two bosses were punished by their ostensible subordinates for undermining the truce. What this incident means for the future viability of the truce is up for debate. First announced in March and negotiated with the mediation of an ex-congressman, the pact of non-aggression between MS-13 and Barrio 18 enjoyed at least some tacit support from the Salvadoran government, though the degree to which the government was making concessions has been a subject of dispute. (The digital newspaper El Faro said that the gangs agreed to the truce in exchange for the government transferring dozens of incarcerated members of the two gangs to lower security facilities. Both the gangs and the government denied this.) This led some to accuse Salvadoran authorities of collaborating with the enemy, and regardless of whose version is really true, the pact marked a surprising change of direction in the nation that used the ""mano dura"", or hard-handed, approach to street crime last decade. Nevertheless, the initial results were encouraging. During the first week following the prisoner transfers, murders dropped by 53 percent from their average over the previous year, and by a comparable figure over the first four months of the pact. As analyst James Bosworth has reported , this put El Salvador on track for an annualized murder rate of 34 murders per 100,000 residents, a far cry from its previous status as among the most violence-addled nations on the planet, and far safer than neighboring Honduras. The truce period also brought about El Salvador's first day free of murder in three years. Despite the potential unseemliness of being perceived to have negotiated with criminals, institutional actors like the Organization of American States and the Catholic Church have thrown their weight behind the arrangement. However murders have ticked up in recent months. As noted by InSight Crime , El Salvador registered 58 murders over the first week of August, a 33 percent increase over the average in July. This figure is nonetheless almost 40 percent less than the weekly average in January, but increases in violent crime often contribute to a self-reinforcing feedback loop, in which violence begets violence. The recent rise in murders is even more disconcerting against the backdrop of infighting among members of one of the most important groups. Though there were just two victims in Soyapango, internecine bloodshed is rarely a harbinger of peace. The inability of bosses to control their underlings suggests a breakdown in the organizational coherence of the gang. If there ceases to be any controlling structure guiding (and limiting) the actions of the thousands of MS-13 members in El Salvador, the results could be scary. Yet the one reassuring aspect of this case is that the killers were evidently working to protect the truce, not undermine it. This suggests that there is a level of support for a truce from within the ranks of the gangs that one or two aggressive leaders are not capable of overturning. Such an organic faith in the benefits of a less aggressive code of conduct, and the willingness to demand that all members of the group abide by it, offers the promise of an enduring shift toward a more peaceful equilibrium. In other words, two trends -one hopeful, the other worrying- may be working at cross-purposes. For El Salvador's recent security gains to become truly entrenched, the two must remain aligned: the structural coherence of the two major gangs must remain intact, and, from top to bottom and with a minimum of dissent, the members of MS-13 and Barrio 18 must maintain their commitment to peace.

"Colombia to Extradite Paramilitary Drug Capo Don Mario. Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos has signed the order that will send drug trafficker and former paramilitary chief Daniel Rendon Herrera, alias ""Don Mario,"" to the US, following a drawn out case that has raised questions relevant to the current peace process with the FARC guerrillas. Don Mario is wanted by the Southern District Court of New York for conspiring to traffic drugs and supporting a terrorist organization -- demobilized right-wing paramilitary umbrella group the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). He is a prominent figure in Colombia's conflict who worked for the leaders of the AUC before founding his own criminal organization, following his demobilization in 2006. Santos' signing of Don Mario's extradition order followed years of legal wrangling. In 2010, Colombia's Supreme Court ruled that Don Mario could not be extradited until he had participated in the country's reparations process, under the terms of the Justice and Peace Law. The process guarantees paramilitaries a certain degree of amnesty in exchange for testimony about the conflict. Don Mario did not disappoint. As Verdad Abierta details , he told the Justice and Peace court about the Colombian military's collaboration with the paramilitaries, and described the backing that some AUC leaders provided to political campaigns. But he also admitted that after formally laying down his arms in 2006, he continued his involvement in trafficking drugs and other crimes, until his arrest in 2009. Last year, the Justice and Peace court ruled that because of this, he was ineligible for the benefits provided under the demobilization law. The drug trafficking organization established by Don Mario, the Urabenos, went on to become the most powerful criminal group in Colombia, as detailed in a special investigation by InSight Crime. Don Mario's fate echoes that of 14 top paramilitary commanders who were extradited to the US in a surprise move in 2008, after former President Alvaro Uribe claimed they had failed to cooperate with the peace process. However, in contrast to this group of paramilitary leaders, Don Mario provided more information about his criminal networks and his crimes. His extradition may provoke arguments from victims of the conflict and others that sending him to the US to be tried for drug trafficking will inhibit efforts to further investigate crimes against humanity that the paramilitaries committed in Colombia. This is the type of uncomfortable trade-off that Colombia's political system is now considering with rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who have been in peace talks with the government since 2012. Many top FARC commanders are wanted in the US for drug trafficking, and are unlikely to agree to a peace deal unless the government can assure them they won't meet a fate like Don Mario's.

"Six Shortcomings of Mexicos New Justice System. Mexico's new justice system went into effect in June 2016. Bu t because the law was constrained by a deadline, there are several key actions that authorities have not yet implemented or that need to be strengthened to ensure the system's functionality, according to experts interviewed about the topic. In light of the insistence of several governors and National Security Commissioner Renato Sales Heredia to change the law to expand the kinds of crimes that merit automatic detention, Animal Politico consulted with judicial authorities, academics and lawyers to get their opinion on the issue. *This story was translated, edited for clarity, and published with permission from Animal Politico. It does not necessarily reflect the views of InSight Crime. See the Spanish original here. The experts agreed that modifying the accusatory system without prior evaluation is a departure from what Sales and the governors originally advocated for. Animal Politico presents the most important outstanding issues with the new criminal justice system, as outlined by experts. Strengthening precautionary measures The Precautionary Measures Monitoring Unit, a vital branch responsible for assessing the risk profile of the detainees, has still not been created. This unit would allow judges to use risk assessments to issue precautionary measures for detainees, including imprisonment, detention, search and seizure, etc. In several states, local units do exist, but the Director of the Criminal Procedural Justice Institute (Instituto de Justicia Procesal Penal), Javier Carrasco, says that many do not work well and require strengthening. Hire specialized staff Although for eight years the accusatory criminal system considered the creation of alternative justice units, public defense offices, precautionary measures, procedural police and victim assistance programs, among others, human resources are currently insufficient. ""One of the big mistakes of the system is that investments were made in infrastructure, in training, in models of institutional organization, but the greatest crisis we have today is in terms of personnel. It is a system that has new legal entities and requires new specialized personnel,"" said Hector Diaz, the former director of institutional coordination of the Technical Secretariat for the Implementation of Penal Reform (Secretaria Tecnica de Implementacion de la Reforma Penal -- SETEC.) In sum, there is a shortage of lawyers, advisers, police and experts who are trained in the new criminal system, and a need to hire more that are competent. More mediation and alternative solutions to conflict Data from the Attorney General's Office (Procuraduria General de la Republica - PGR) indicate that out of 83,000 cases opened under the new criminal system for federal offenses, less than a thousand have been resolved through mediation and alternative mechanisms. On the other hand, more than 10,000 cases have been assigned to judges; the rest are still pending. Mediation is one of the pillars of the new criminal system because it allows for the resolution of crimes that are less serious, for example in cases of civil offenses. Animal Politico was able to verify locally that there is often no staff in the regional mediation units. This is the case at the Public Prosecutor's CUH-1 Office in Mexico City's Attorney General's Office, where for a period of four hours an official never appeared. Electronic Bracelets for Dangerous Inmates According to article 155 of the National Criminal Procedure Code, one precautionary measure for a ""risk person"" is an ankle or bracelet monitor, but such tools have yet to be introduced. Electronic bracelets cannot be used for two reasons: there is no precautionary measures unit that would supervise them; and the government simply has not acquired them, Carrasco stated. Train police officers and strengthen investigations According to experts, the police themselves are the single greatest point of weakness in the new system. Just months before the implementation deadline of the system throughout the country, 90 percent of officers were still not trained. They received a last-minute, intensive course, which covered basic fundamentals, but failed to include the necessary specialization for integration into the system. Data from the federal judiciary indicates that 85 percent of cases filed with federal judges are committed in ""flagrante delito,"" that is, the criminals are caught red-handed, with no ensuing investigation. Supervision and technical evaluation of the system's operation The implementation of the penal system in June 2016 was coordinated by SETEC with an administration equipped with independent personnel and an autonomous budget, currently headed by Maria de los Angeles Fromow. This program created progress indicators, ordered spending and identified priorities. SETEC had an array of indicators that supposedly evaluated the operation of the system and would recognize the weak points in each state, thanks to more than two years of accumulated experience. But after the start of the reform, despite the fact that President Enrique Pena Nieto had committed in 2014 and 2015 to continue supporting the unit, the government cut the funding to SETEC, which ended up being dismantled. According to estimates made by SETEC, the new penal syste m won't be fully operational un til 2024. * This story was translated, edited for clarity, and published with permission from Animal Politico.

"With Zetas Decimated, Sinaloa Cartel has Won the War. The end of Zetas boss Heriberto Lazcano is part of a long list of Mexican drug traffickers whose ""death"" provoked more questions than answers, argues David Martinez-Amador. And his disappearance will help nobody more than the Sinaloa Cartel. In Mexico, there are two ways that big capos can decide to end their career. They can make a surrender deal, as happened with Juan G. Abrego (leader of the Gulf Cartel before Osiel Cardenas), and more recently with ""La Barbie"" -- detentions where not a single shot was fired. Alternatively, they can fake their own deaths and go into retirement. There will simply be no corpse, or when there is one, the vital statistics will not fit. Now, I'm not saying that this is the case with Heriberto Lazcano. The debate for me is whether Z-3 was murdered or committed suicide. Within Mexico's narco-world, this is a valid question. Take the case of Arturo Beltran Leyva, the head of the Beltran Leyva Organization , who was killed by the navy in 2009. His left arm and shoulder had been completely removed, turned to puree, by what appeared to be a HKP-7 pistol. This weapon is of exclusive use of the navy. The blast tears and deforms whatever it touches, due to its hollow-point bullets. [Read InSight Crime's blow-by-blow account of the takedown of Beltran Leyva here ] What makes the Beltran Leyva case more interesting is that Beltran's trousers had been lowered, something the security forces do to immobilize detainees. In essence, it seemed as if Beltran was murdered in cold blood, while putting up no resistance. Faced with this kind of attack, the Mexican drug traffickers use the famous ""cop-killer"" pistol, the ""five-seven"" (5.7x28mm), which can pass through a bullet-proof vest at 200 meters like a knife in butter. There is simply no way to stop it. From what has been written about Lazcano's death, his confrontation with the navy seems similar, though the photographs of his ""corpse"" do not show the same type of mutilation from the blast. It makes sense, then, to ask whether this is the right body. Let's not forget the case of Ignacio ""Nacho"" Coronel ( killed by the Mexican Army on July 29, 2010 ). The data from the autopsy did not fit with the official descriptions of the ""King of Synthetic Drugs,"" who was third in command of the Pacific Organization, or Sinaloa Cartel. The body was much younger and taller than Nacho's would have been. If this alleged death seems strange, we should remember that, when Mexico and Cuba broke off relations in 2004, the Fidel Castro government requested that Amado Carrillo Fuentes (the ""Lord of the Skies"") leave the island. He had, supposedly, died during failed plastic surgery in a hospital in the Mexico City in 1997. [See Mexico's top 10 Narco conspiracy theories here ] President Felipe Calderon began his time in the presidency striking hard blows against the enemies of the Sinlaoa Cartel. He killed Arturo Beltran, locked up Hector Beltran, and detained La Barbie. He weakened the Gulf Cartel, killing Antonio Cardenas Guillen (""Tony Tormenta"") in an operation that left more than 300 dead; and detained, without a shot, Eduardo Costilla "" El Coss ,"" who had been left in charge of the cartel. Now Calderon's government is coming to its end, still showing supreme loyalty to the Sinaloa clan. Its last enemies, the Zetas (who ""El Gallo de Oro"" calls ""Los quemados"" in his songs), have been hit harder by the government than any other cartel. This administration has killed more than 25 Zetas leaders, fragmenting the group, and, it appears, got rid of even Lazcano. In Culiacan, they must be offering up their thanks to Calderon. The Sinaloa Cartel today emerges as the only cartel to be left intact, without its historic leaders setting foot in prison, and its arrangements with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Calderon's National Action Party (PAN) party laid bare. They are the winners of the war. ""Saciamorbos,"" the latest book by Carlos Loret de Mola, recounts a conversation between Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman Loera and Enrique Pena Nieto, in which the former accuses the ""beautiful governor"" of protecting Beltran Leyva cartel hitmen. ""From now on, your life is in my hands. You will not become president,"" said the Lord of the Sierra. I wonder, will Pena Nieto arrive at the presidential residence, or will he make a deal with his life? Republished with permission of the author.

"Argentina Govt Created Culture of Impunity: Report. A new study analyzes the political and judicial environment in Argentina, arguing that the current government has allowed a culture of impunity to take root and, in doing so, enabled the death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman. In an International Assessment and Strategy Center (IASC) report titled ""The Murder of Alberto Nisman: How the Government of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner Created the Environment for a Perfect Crime,"" analyst Douglas Farah examines the circumstances surrounding Nisman's death, and offers a damning critique of the Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner administration. Nisman was investigating the 1994 car bombing of an Israeli community center in Buenos Aires -- in which Iran is widely suspected to have played a role -- that left 85 dead and hundreds wounded. He was found dead in his apartment on January 18 , the day before he was to present his case to Congress. According to Farah, Nisman had uncovered a plot by the Kirchner government to guarantee impunity for Iranian officials indicted in the bombing case. In exchange, Kirchner sought oil to relieve fuel shortages, as well as promises to buy agricultural products and weapons. Since his death, a judge has dismissed Nisman's judicial accusation, a move Farah calls ""part of a much larger mosaic of corruption, foreign influence peddling, and lawlessness which has come to define [the Kirchner] government."" Citing recent polls that show 70 percent of Argentinians believe the crime will never be solved, Farah argues that the government suffers from a complete lack of credibility, which is further demonstrated by numerous corruption scandals that have dogged members of the current government. Overall, Farah claims that the suspicious circumstances surrounding Nisman's death, and its inadequate investigation, demonstrate how Kirchner ""now presides over a highly criminalized state,"" one that is ""more allied with rogue nations and terrorism than with democracy and the rule of law."" Farah's analysis of the circumstances surrounding Nisman's death highlights a culture of impunity that has likely contributed to the country's deteriorating security situation and growing role in the drug trade. In previous reports , the IASC has examined scandals involving money laundering, corruption, and precursor chemical trafficking in which members of the Kirchner administration have been implicated, as well as allegations that Kirchner has meddled in judicial proceedings. Meanwhile, Argentina appears to be playing a growing role as both a drug transit and consumption nation, and has seen rising violence and the presence of foreign drug trafficking groups in addition to increasingly sophisticated local crime syndicates. In addition, Nisman's case is not the first time a high-profile case in Argentina has involved a mysterious death. In the past, several key witnesses in politically sensitive cases have perished in unusual circumstances, preventing the judicial system from achieving justice."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Report Spotlights Drug Traffic at Santos Port, Brazils Drug Policies. The United Nations' 2016 World Drug Report's finding that Brazil is the most frequent country of departure for cocaine going to African, Asian and European markets has refocused attention on Santos, the country's largest port, and raised questions about the effectiveness of Brazil's overall drug policy and enforcement measures. Despite being the principal transatlantic shipping point for cocaine, the recent report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) notes that Brazil only accounted for 7 percent of South America's cocaine seizures from 2009 to 2014. Santos Port: The PCC's Drug Trafficking Backyard Santos port, located in Sao Paulo state, is a crucial link in South America's principal drug trafficking transit routes , with estimates suggesting that as much as 80 percent of cocaine arriving in Europe transits through this regional shipping hub. In Santos, a network of small drug trafficking groups linked to the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC), one of Brazil's largest organized crime groups, traffic cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamines to Europe, Africa, and Asia. From its base in Sao Paulo, the PCC oversees a large percentage of drug trafficking from production areas in Colombia, Paraguay, Peru and Bolivia, to supply both domestic and international markets. Drugs first transit through various Brazilian states like Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Amazonas, before ending up on the streets of Brazil's major cities or being trafficked abroad via the country's ports. The PCC reportedly traffics around 40 tons of cocaine a year worth approximately $60 million primarily through Santos port. 'Ndrangheta, the Calabria-based Italian mafia group, is reportedly one of the PCC's most important international commercial partners. PCC Power Continues to Grow Despite various police operations against the PCC and smaller drug trafficking groups operating in Santos and further up the supply chain, drug trafficking remains a major problem at the port. However, drug trafficking at Santos port seemingly dipped following a federal police sting in March 2014, in which 23 PCC-linked drug traffickers were arrested and 3.7 tons of cocaine seized. Last year, only 1.5 tons of narcotics, including cocaine and methamphetamines, were seized by authorities at the port, compared to roughly four tons in 2013 and 2014. It is unclear whether this is attributable to a decrease in drug trafficking via Santos port, or alternatively, less effective drug enforcement and screening measures. As the data from the UNODC report was collected between 2009 and 2014, it likely does not factor in the impact of the 2014 federal police sting, rendering the verification of the effectiveness of police operations premature. The way in which port operations in Brazil are structured and organized renders them a soft target for groups like the PCC that retain significant financial muscle, local influence, and can rely on a network of an estimated 11,000 members. Nevertheless, drug shipment seizures continue to be reported on a regular basis at the port. In a recent raid in June, federal police seized 700 kg of cocaine concealed in a shipping container bound for Belgium. Furthermore, the PCC appears to have significantly expanded its reach in Brazil despite numerous security operations against its illicit activities. According to an Estadao de Sao Paulo report , PCC now has a presence in all 27 Brazilian states, in addition to bases in Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Venezuela. In addition, a recent Folha de Sao Paulo report highlighted how the PCC joined forces with the Rio-based Red Command (Comando Vermelho) to oust a rival drug trafficking group that controlled the drug trade from Paraguay to Brazil. Growing Bolivia-Brazil Cocaine Trade Feeding Santos The growing Brazil-Bolivia border drug trade has recently come under increased scrutiny, particularly as Bolivia provides one of the closest and direct sources of cocaine for drug-traffickers at Santos port. According to an El Deber report , Bolivia's Santa Cruz department, which lies adjacent to the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, is currently the dominant cocaine-producing and trafficking area in that country. Brazilian and Bolivian authorities recently launched a new multinational drug enforcement agency tasked with combating the cross-border drug trade. In late June, this produced results when a joint Brazilian-Bolivian police operation dismantled a drug trafficking group moving approximately two tons of cocaine a month from Puerto Quijarro in Santa Cruz to Santos via Mato Grosso do Sul state. The group reportedly relied on a fleet of 70 trucks to transport the drugs to the port. Corruption and Bribery at Port Facilities Corruption is a key facilitator for the PCC drug shipments out of Santos port. The way in which port operations in Brazil are structured and organized renders them a soft target for groups like the PCC that retain significant financial muscle, local influence, and can rely on a network of an estimated 11,000 members. A large percentage of drug trafficking at Santos port involves the smuggling of cocaine and other drugs into cargo ship containers or into the ship storage compartments themselves. Traffickers reportedly also smuggle drugs onto container ships anchored in the bay using speedboats, and are often aided by corrupt crew members. One of the principal vulnerabilities in Santos is that cargo can be stored for several months in privately managed export storage sites known as Recinto Especial para Despacho Aduaneiro de Exportacao (REDEXs). There are over 47 of them in Santos alone, each managed by a different company. A lack of an overarching authority and weak information sharing among REDEX authorities is likely exploited by the PCC and other drug trafficking groups. According to some reports, corruption and bribery is commonplace among officials and employees working at these facilities. In the 2014 federal police sting, an official working at a REDEX facility in Santos was arrested for allegedly supplying PCC leaders with information on ship arrival dates, routes, and types of cargo. The investigation also revealed that complicit port workers and customs officials were paid $1,500 for facilitating the movement of drugs onto container ships. In March 2016, two port security guards were arrested and charges with facilitating drug trafficking at the port. Collusion between corrupt police officers and drug traffickers is also a significant problem at the port. In late June 2016, police arrested 13 members of a PCC-linked drug trafficking gang operating in the area. They reportedly operated with the complicity of several military police officers and potentially a local authority councilor. Sources consulted by InSight Crime confirmed that transnational drug trafficking continues largely unabated at Santos port, and that the PCC remains the dominant player. A port security manager working at Santos who asked to remain anonymous told InSight Crime that drug trafficking is back to the same levels witnessed prior to the 2014 federal police sting. He noted that ""current investment in security at the port is hampered by bureaucratic requirements, and, in practice, is not sufficient to counter the drug trafficking threat."" Regarding corruption and bribery practices within the REDEXs, the port security official noted that ""while it is hard to prove that it exists, there is definitely a feeling that it is there, particularly among security guards that handle the containers."" Beyond private security enforcement in Santos' REDEXs, questions need to be asked about Brazil's overall enforcement capabilities. In Brazil, drug enforcement is decentralized and convoluted. Each of Brazil's 27 states has one or more drug enforcement bodies, some larger and better-financed than others. For example, Sao Paulo state's drug enforcement institution, the Department of Narcotics Investigations (Departamento de Investigacoes sobre Narcoticos - DENARC), is well-financed and is considered more effective than many other state-level drug enforcement units, albeit not free of corruption. Either way, it is clear that Brazil's drug enforcement agencies and policies require a fundamental overhaul to reduce bureaucracy and increase both internal and external cooperation. In addition, the General Office for Narcotics Prevention and Repression (Coordenacao-Geral de Prevencao e Repressao a Entorpecentes/DF - CGORE/DF) is a federal police unit charged with overseeing drug enforcement on a national level. And the navy regularly conducts surveillance and raids. A lack of cooperation between the various drug enforcement units is one of the major flaws in Brazil's national drug enforcement strategy. As such, the July launch of the inter-institutional Brasil Central Seguro drug enforcement operation in six states produced immediate results and demonstrated the potential effectiveness of national-level cooperation on drug enforcement. The Michel Temer interim government has indicated that additional national-level drug enforcement operations are likely, with the new minister of Social Development, Osmar Terra, recently calling for increased border control and stricter penalties for drug trafficking. However, rather than increasing enforcement, policy think tanks like The Brazilian Platform for Drug Policy (Plataforma Brasileira de Politica de Drogas - PBPD) continue to question the effectiveness of the Brazilian government's so-called ""war on drugs."" In an email correspondence with InSight Crime, PBPD Coordinator of Institutional Relations Gabriel Santos Elias said Brazil's ""war on drugs has failed because it's essentially based on repression, without focusing enough on education and prevention, as well as the general health of drug users in Brazil."" Over and above cooperation among the various state-level drug enforcement agencies, Elias pointed out that there is a fundamental conflict in strategy between the National Drug Policy Secretariat (Secretaria Nacional de Politica de Drogas - SENAD), the federal government drug policy institution which ""traditionally defends a more integrated approach to Brazil's drug policies,"" and ""the security forces who suppress drug use without understanding SENAD's policies."" Noting that no country has ever successfully applied enforcement to reduce drug use or trafficking, Elias and the PBPD advocate for Brazil to pursue a policy based on regulation and education in cooperation with both the regional and international communities. Either way, it is clear that Brazil's drug enforcement agencies and policies require a fundamental overhaul to reduce bureaucracy and increase both internal and external cooperation. As long as Brazil's drug policy enforcement hinges on a disjointed and decentralized system, and jars with the increasingly pro-regulation policies espoused by some regional neighbors, groups like the PCC are likely to continue to expand their national and international reach. *Lloyd Belton is a political and country risk analyst at the consulting firm S-RM ."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Honduras Police Chief Says Officers Plotting to Kill Him. A week after the former security minister was gunned down, Honduras' chief of police said during a graduation ceremony that some officers have plotted to kill him. According to Police Director Jose Ricardo Ramirez del Cid , some of his own officers have been involved in assasination attempts against him. He added that the most recent attempt involved a group of seven gunmen arrested on December 8. Authorities originally said that the gunmen were planning to bust an inmate out of a high-security prison. Other security officials later confirmed that the gunmen were charged with assasinating a top ranking police officer, but did not name Ramirez del Cid. The comments came shortly after the former Honduran Security Minister Alfredo Landaverde was gunned down in Tegucigalpa. Ramirez del Cid's allegations join a long list of complaints about corruption and abuse within the Honduran police. Police have been accused of selling guns to criminals , using excessive force and working with organized crime. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Forces Kill 346 Gang Members This Year. El Salvador's police reportedly killed 346 gang members in violent confrontations so far this year, once again raising concerns that the country's bellicose security strategy is leading to widespread human rights abuses. Howard Cotto, director of El Salvador's National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil - PNC), said police supported by soldiers killed the 346 suspected gang members in an equal number of confrontations since the beginning of 2016, reported El Mundo. That averages out to 2.2 confrontations -- and slain gang members -- per day. Cotto did not specify how many members of the security forces died in those confrontations. However other reports indicate that suspected gang members had killed a total of 16 police officers by April 12 of this year, and many of those officers were killed while off duty, outside of the operations referenced by the police director. The number of confrontations have increased in recent weeks following the deployment of combined police and military forces in a special unit tasked with hunting down gang members who have reportedly moved to rural areas to avoid tightened security in major cities. Most of the confrontations Cotto referred to have taken place in rural areas, El Mundo reported. The large number of gang members killed and the disproportionately low number of officers being shot in those operations raises serious questions about the circumstances in which the deaths occurred. Across Latin America , from Mexico to Venezuela and Brazil, the term ""confrontation"" is used to explain lopsided body counts and cover up human rights abuses by the security forces. The government's ongoing crackdown has raised similar concerns about El Salvador, where there are already well-documented cases of extrajudicial killings by police officers. In a March 2015 case, PNC officers reported having killed eight criminals in an exchange of gunfire at a coffee farm known as San Blas. An investigation by Salvadoran news outlet El Faro found that the ""criminals,"" who included a woman and two minors, had been summarily executed and that their bodies had been repositioned to support the police's version of events. Salvadoran officials' militarization of the fight against gangs, both materially and rhetorically , may be contributing to more aggressive action by an emboldened public force. In January 2015, for example, then-PNC Director -- and current Security minister -- Mauricio Ramirez Landaverde told his officers they should feel ""complete confidence "" when using their weapons against criminals."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Murderous Day A Reality Check for El Salvador Government. The killing of dozens in El Salvador in a single day, despite government claims that a hardline policy against violent gangs is working, shows these criminal groups maintain their lethal power, and may signal a resurgence of spiking violence in the country. El Salvador's head of National Police Howard Cotto announced during a press conference on March 16 that 30 individuals were killed during the previous day, reported La Prensa. According to Cotto, at least 17 of the deaths were directly linked to the country's powerful gangs. Hours before the announcement, authorities had praised the more than 62 percent decrease in homicides between January 1st and March 14th 2017 and the same period in 2016. El Salvador witnessed 651 murders during those dates this year, a significant drop from last year's 1,722. Among the lethal incidents on March 16 were the deaths of six individuals in the capital city's historic centre following a shootout between gang members and private security guards over extortion activities. Another incident took place in the San Martin municipality of the San Salvador department, where gang members murdered three individuals. In their attempt to flee, six suspects, allegedly members of the Barrio 18 gang, were killed by elements of the Special Reactionary Forces (Fuerzas Especializadas de Reaccion El Salvador - FES), reported El Mundo. Four of them were shot in their escape vehicle. According to the Nicaraguan media La Prensa , Cotto refuted the notion that these incidents signalled a new wave of violence and insecurity. This stance was echoed by the Justice and Public Security Minister Mauricio Ramirez Landaverde, who chose to describe the murderous day as ""abnormal."" These recent violent events show that the maras still possess the power to wreak havoc in the country, despite the government's anti-gang strategy. Cotto in February praised the extraordinary measures implemented in 2016 against gangs for their alleged impact on the decrease of homicides that year. But as InSight Crime had noted then , the fall in violence may have been as much the result of a decision by the gangs to ease their attacks than of a government policy. SEE ALSO : El Salvador News and Profiles The killing of the six suspects in San Martin, including four within their own vehicle, indicates that the government is maintaining its hardline crackdown on the gangs. Authorities asserted that the gang members opened fire first, but there is growing evidence of increased extrajudicial killings by El Salvadoran security forces, and the FES was set up with the explicit purpose of violently cracking down on gangs. Given this context, the latest incidents could constitute early signs of an end to the 2016 trend of decreasing homicides."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"LatAms Top 5 Criminal Industries that Damage the Environment. As world leaders congregate in Paris to discuss how to address global climate change, InSight Crime highlights five criminal industries that are causing enormous environmental degradation in Latin America. With climate talks underway in Paris, the world's focus has once again turned to how to preserve the environment. While a highly daunting challenge in and of itself, in Latin America there is an added layer of complexity to confronting the issue: the region's criminal networks, which are a major source of environmental harm via their illicit activities. Below, InSight Crime lists five criminal industries that are depleting and degrading Latin America's natural resources. 1. Illegal Logging - Amazon Rainforest Roughly 20 percent of the Amazon has been deforested in the last 40 years , and another 20 percent is in a state of degradation. Although deforestation in the Amazon is slowing, the rate at which the rainforest is losing trees is still among the world's highest. The illegal timber trade is a principal driver of deforestation in the Amazon. In Brazil, 80 percent of all logging is illegal, according to government estimates. Criminal networks involved in illegal logging are quick to protect their interests by threatening those who oppose them and by even imposing their own rule of law in these remote areas. According to the non-governmental organization Global Witness , no less than 448 environmentalists and land activists were killed between 2002 and 2013 in Brazil, with most cases related to logging. Illegal logging is big business for criminal groups in the Peruvian and Colombian Amazon region as well. In fact, authorities in Peru recently made the largest ever seizure of illegal timber in the northern jungle region of Loreto, confiscating 60 truckloads of contraband wood valued at nearly $500,000. 2. Cocaine Production - Colombia, Peru, Bolivia Almost every stage of the cocaine production process is environmentally hazardous. The most common form of environmental damage comes from the dumping of harmful chemicals used to process coca leaves (such as gasoline and acetone) directly into rivers and streams. In addition to major cocaine-producing regions such as Colombia's Narino department and Peru's Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valleys (VRAEM), residents in Bolivia have complained recently of contaminated rivers as a result of cocaine production. Cocaine production is a huge revenue earner for criminal and insurgent groups in the region, such as the Shining Path in Peru and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in Colombia. The FARC is estimated to make at least $200 million by taxing various links of the drug supply chain, including coca growers. 3. Oil Theft - Mexico Criminal groups tapping oil pipelines poses obvious environmental risks. In early 2013, hundreds of liters of crude oil spilled into Mexico's rivers following a series of clandestine taps targeting the pipelines of Pemex, the country's state-owned oil company. More recently, Mexico's San Juan river was severely contaminated as the result of illegal pipeline tapping in August 2014. The fragmentation of Mexico's underworld has caused organized crime groups to diversify their criminal portfolio beyond drug trafficking, and oil theft has become a highly lucrative business. Pemex registered a 58 percent increase in the number of pipelines illegally tapped during the first quarter of 2015, with the highest concentration in areas that have a strong organized crime presence. The Zetas and the Gulf Cartel are believed to be two criminal groups deeply involved in oil theft. 4. Informal Gold Mining - Peru, Colombia Illegal gold mines require the use of liquid mercury to separate the minerals from river sediment, causing serious environmental harm. The extent of the damage is so great that Colombia's northern department of Antioquia, a hub of illegal gold mining activity, has been called the ""world's most polluted place by mercury."" Cyanide is another harmful byproduct of gold mines that is often dumped into waterways; one river in Antioquia has been dubbed ""La Cianurada"" because of how much cyanide it contains. Guerrilla and narco-paramilitary groups have capitalized on illegal gold mining for years by charging miners what in Colombia is known as a ""vaccination,"" or extortion fee. However, Colombian authorities have told InSight Crime these groups eventually began to deepen their involvement by regulating the mines and using them to launder drug money. The illegal gold mining industry is also highly lucrative in Peru, where it is worth $3 billion per year , according to government officials. Here, the ties between organized crime and gold mining are more nebulous than in Colombia, but Peruvian security analyst Ruben Vargas has said the link between drug traffickers and illegal mining is "" undeniable ."" 5. Wildlife Trafficking - Regional Foreign demand for exotic animal species has made wildlife trafficking one of the most profitable criminal industries in Colombia , as well as various other parts of Latin America. China in particular has fueled smuggling of marine life such as Mexico?s totoaba fish, which is considered a delicacy and whose bladders can be sold for as much as $20,000. Given these profits, it is hardly surprising criminal groups have swooped in to capitalize on the voracious demand for the region's abundant and diverse wildlife. Criminal networks traffic rare birds in eastern and northern Guatemala, while as many as 300 Brazilian gangs are thought to be involved in stealing endangered species from the Amazon and selling them on the black market."	1	0	0	0	0	1	0
"El Salvador Police Dispute Governments Gang Murder Stats. There is confusion over how many of El Salvador's murder victims are gang members, showing that an increased understanding of the gang problem is necessary to successful address the country's worsening security situation. A report recently given by El Salvador's National Police (PNC by its Spanish initials) to local newspaper El Faro said of the more than 2,000 homicide victims registered in El Salvador between January and May, only 30% were gang members. This contradicts multiple officials from President Salvador Sanchez Ceren's administration, who claimed 60% of El Salvador murder victims belonged to, or were affiliated with, street gangs. ""Approximately 60% of homicides are the result of gang disputes within the country,"" El Salvador security minister Benito Lara said when speaking to press in June about public security issues. At a following press conference communications secretary Eugenio Chica elaborated ""the majority of those killed are linked to gangs and criminals, while 40% are regular citizens."" The PNC did not indicate why their figures on murdered gang members were lower than those cited by central government figures. However it did say that it could revise murder statistics as each case developed. Future revisions are unlikely, El Faro said, as the vast majority of El Salvador's murder cases go unsolved. The conflict between the PNC and the central government's murder victim figures echo previous findings by local newspaper La Prensa Grafica. The newspaper determined that authorities often over report the number of gang-affiliated homicide victims, largely due to poor investigation techniques and a lack of understanding as to what constitutes a gang member. Part of this has to do with the difficulty in deciding whether to only count fully initiated gang members as part of the group, or to include the large networks of collaborators and affiliates that Mara gangs rely on. Scant resources and the desire to write off El Salvador's ever rising murder rates as criminals killing other criminals may discourage authorities from further investigating how gangs interact with the surrounding community. However understanding how the non-initiated work with gangs -willingly or under coercion- is crucial to protecting citizens and improving El Salvador's dire public security situation."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
Why are Killings of Security Forces in Venezuela on the Rise?The number of security personnel murdered in Venezuela rose nearly 20 percent in 2014, a reflection of the rising violence in the country and the possible high level of corruption within the security forces. The Venezuelan non-governmental organization Fundepro registered 338 killings of police, military, and private security officials in the country last year, reported El Universal. This represents an 18 percent increase from the 295 homicides of security forces in 2013, but a slight drop from the 350 reported cases in 2012. With 132 homicides last year, Caracas registered more than double the number of murdered security officials from any other state in Venezuela (see graph below by El Universal). Municipal police were the most targeted, while state and military forces also suffered over 50 casualties. Thirty-one members of Venezuela's investigative police force, CICPC, were reportedly killed in 2014. In an email correspondence, Fundepro told InSight Crime its data was based on police and military statistics as well as media reports. If the beginning of 2015 is any indication, the violence directed towards security forces is unlikely to abate in the near future. Twenty police, military, and private security guards were killed during the first 19 days in 2015, according to El Universal. Attacks on security forces are a tricky thing to decipher. The security forces are often vulnerable in places like Venezuela because they are chronically short-staffed, underfunded, undertrained and under-equipped. What's more, the high rates of violence in the country puts them in extremely vulnerable positions. Fundepro said the violence against security forces was related to the ease with which criminals can get weapons. One year after the implementation of a disarmament law, authorities reported less than one percent of all illegal firearms in the country had been seized. In response to this insecurity some police recently told a newspaper they were doing the minimum necessary to stop crime in the streets due to the risk they felt while on patrol. An increasing number of law enforcement officers are also reportedly quitting the force and opting to work for private security companies, which they consider safer. On the other hand, security forces are also known to be involved in kidnapping and extortion operations; elements of the country's military have been connected to the country's drug trade. On the local level, the head of Venezuela's police reform commission, Freddy Bernal, recently stated the commission plans to intervene in nine municipal police forces with links to organized crime.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Peruvian Authorities Switch Gears in Combating Cocaine Air Bridge. Equipped primarily with old US planes, drug traffickers in Bolivia and Peru have rebuilt the cocaine air bridge that was first popularized during the 1980s and 1990s. Authorities are scrambling to find ways to shut down the revamped air bridge. During the last seconds of its last flight, a drug plane broke through the tree canopy and crashed in the middle of the forest. When a military helicopter crew was deployed last year on November 23 to look for the wrecked plane, it took them seven hours to reach the crash site trekking through the forest on foot. Inside the plane's main body, which had detached from the engine, the search team found the pilot's body. According to the somewhat unclear reports from the police who conducted the forensic examination of the crash site, the pilot was found simultaneously seated at the controls of the plane and curled up in the fetal position. This article was originally published by IDL-Reporteros and was translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission. See Spanish original here. Nearby, investigators found polyethylene sacks containing 356.6 kilos of cocaine. It was obvious that the accident had occurred during a return drug flight. Inside the plane and scattered around the crash site were the flight summary materials and the damaged equipment of aerial narcotics traffickers: a satellite telephone, two Garmin GPS devices, two radio transmitters, and two cell phones. The aircraft was registered as a Bolivian plane under the identification number CP-2890. The destroyed plane was a Cessna U260G, owned by Martin Rapozo Villavicencio. The name might not have meant much to the search team who had to spend the night in the forest before being evacuated via helicopter the following day, but among the relatively small group of police who work on counter-narcotics intelligence operations, the name resonated. Before being used to fly cocaine across the mountains and rain forests of Peru, the plane registered as CP-2890 hailed from Anchorage, Alaska. Nearing the end of its useful life, the plane was purchased by Rapozo in July 2013 and was subsequently exported to Bolivia. The plane was one of dozens of old American airplanes sold to Bolivian buyers instead of being sent to the scrap yard. In the 1980s and 1990s, a group of audacious, astute, and radically unscrupulous narcotics traffickers began to produce and process cocaine in Peru, later transporting it to Colombia via an ""air bridge"" for further refinement and subsequent export to the United States. Years later, at the beginning of the 21 st century, with the big Colombian narcotics traffickers relegated to the scripts of soap operas, a new generation of drug traffickers began to re-establish the cocaine air bridge between the two countries. However, this time it wasn't the Colombians but rather the Bolivians (for the most part), and they were no longer sending drugs north but rather to the south. The Bolivians put their fleet of patched-up planes into the air and, since at least the end of 2013, have been invading the skies of Peru and expanding the drug trafficking air bridge. Identifying the Major Players in the Cocaine Air Bridge Who are these drug traffickers? How did they rebuild the air bridge? How are authorities fighting them? We'll find out here. In 2014, the drug flights were concentrated in Peru's tri-river valley known as the VRAEM, and the number of flights were increasing every day. Trapped by the traditional problems of political impotency, the Peruvian government wanted to tackle the problem but would not dare to do so in the face of US opposition to aerial interdiction. The government decided they would solve the problem on the ground and not in the skies. Authorities began to dynamite clandestine landing strips that were springing up daily and turning parts of the VRAEM -- like Mayapo and Santa Rosa -- into full-service airports for exporting narcotics. Security forces in Peru were involved in more than 260 operations to destroy landing strips in 2014. Many of these operations failed because traffickers quickly rebuilt the airstrips. In 2015, there have been between 300 and 400 operations to take out landing strips, according to sources close to anti-narcotics efforts in the VRAEM. Some individual landing strips have reportedly been destroyed as many as 7 or 8 times. These airstrips are dynamited, repaired, dynamited again, repaired again, and so on and so forth. Eventually, with enough resources invested by security forces, some of these runways have been abandoned. While a significant number of the security forces both within and outside the VRAEM have seen only modest results from their efforts, a relatively small group of specialized police intelligence officials working with a few dedicated prosecutors have begun putting together the most comprehensive information possible on these drug flights, trying to answer some key questions: where are the planes purchased, who makes the purchases, how do they arrive in Bolivia, how do traffickers legally register them, and how do they take off and land in secret? IDL-Reporteros and Caretas were able to interview prosecutors and members of security forces involved in these efforts, in addition to reviewing the documentation that has been collected so far. The police work on these issues has been notably effective, most of all because of the organic way that cooperation and information sharing has taken place between agencies and units. While there is little emphasis placed on formal mechanisms of inter-agency coordination, investigators emphasize a form of horizontal exchange among colleagues. Key sources of information utilized in the effort have included: Brazil's Federal Police, Bolivia's counter-narcotics police force known as the FELCN, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, Paraguay's Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD), and, of course, information available on the internet. As a result of these efforts, authorities have been able to develop a real-time map of the key protagonists, flights routes, and airplanes being used for aerial drug trafficking. In 2014, 11 airplanes crashed and an additional seven were detained on the ground by Peruvian authorities. In all 18 instances, the recovered or captured planes revealed a great deal of information. During the first three months of 2015, authorities recovered 6 crashed planes and detained one other on the ground. Surveillance of small planes in the VRAEM has enabled authorities to identify almost 50 drug planes. By cross-referencing identified planes with Bolivian aviation registration data, authorities now know the names of the owners of these planes, the registration numbers they had in the United States, who their previous owners were, how much they were sold for, and to whom. This has lead to revealing and interesting information. Martin Rapozo Villavicencio, the owner of the small plane CP-2890 that crashed in 2014, has purchased more than 30 planes in the United States, which he has subsequently exported to Bolivia. IDL-Reporteros and Caretas have viewed the registration numbers of Rapozo's 33 planes, many of which have been spotted flying in the VRAEM and in the Pichis-Palcazu valley. Many of the planes were registered under obvious shell companies, but some were also registered under his brother's name, Fernando Rapozo. The Rapozo family name has appeared repeatedly when looking into the backgrounds of spotted, captured, or crashed planes in Peru. On February 13 of this year, public security forces reportedly discovered the remains of a crashed plane in the forests of Pichari. The serial number on the plane's engine was still identifiable, and it linked back to a plane purchased by a business in Opa-locka, Florida and exported to ""Rapozo Export"" in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Of the thirty-some planes purchased by Rapozo in the United States (where he has a residence in Tarpon Spring, Florida) and exported to Bolivia, records from security forces show that CP-2859 was captured in July 2014; CP-2721 was captured in 2012, while CP-2812 crashed just three days after CP-2890 in November 2014. In terms of aerial security, Rapozo and other Bolivian narcotics transporters make the deadliest bus routes of Lima look safe. Almost all of these planes are purchased near the end of their capacity for flying. Every air bridge flight represents profit for the drug traffickers but contempt for the lives of the pilots. The fact is that Rapozo and other aerial narcotics transporters like the Alvarez Suarez clan have imported full-fledged aerial fleets that have been used to reconstitute the air bridge and greatly intensify narcotics trafficking in the VRAEM during the last two-and-a-half years. Peru's new drug plan shoot-down law could bring about fast results if it is applied intelligently and with the right operational criteria. Very few people who work in the daily fight against narcotics trafficking doubt the law's necessity. According to Jorge Chavez Cotrina, a coordinating prosecutor for organized crime, ""the law is adequate and necessary. It is no secret that small planes carrying drugs are entering the country every day. Neither the Attorney General's Office nor the police could do anything because there was no mechanism for intercepting the flights. [Now] drug traffickers are going to stop entering our air space this has been needed for a long time."" It is clear that aerial interdiction will be a complex operation that will require significant effort and cooperation between agencies in addition to reasonable and intelligent protocols. It is unlikely that the shoot-down law alone is the tool that will end drug trafficking. But it will allow authorities to better fight the dangers posed by aerial drug trafficking and to take on the mobsters who control it and who have so far gone unpunished. *This article was originally published by IDL-Reporteros and was translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission.

"Drug Trafficking Drives Deforestation in Central America: Study. Drug trafficking is responsible for the massive destruction of rainforests across Central America, according to a new study, destroying huge swathes of land for airstrips, roads, and cattle ranches that are used to launder money. Kendra McSweeney, a geographer at Ohio State University and the study's lead author, said her research found ""almost cancer-like growths of really rapid forest cover change,"" which could ""only be explained by the presence of narco-traffickers,"" reported NBC News. In Guatemala and Honduras, forests are cut to build airstrips and roads to facilitate the movement north of South American cocaine, found the study. Drug traffickers are also clearing the land in order to launder their drug proceeds through logging operations and cattle ranches. McSweeney and her colleagues found that annual rates of deforestation in Honduras quadrupled between 2007 and 2011, a time that coincided with an increase in cocaine shipments through the country, as drug routes changed in response to increased pressure from authorities in Mexico. However, McSweeney acknowledged that proving the connection between drug trafficking and deforestation isn't easy; most conservationists left the region around 2007 due to security concerns and officials are often bribed to stay silent. Yet an effort to trace land ownership records in Guatemala, she said, demonstrates new holdings under a well-known ""narco family."" McSweeney argued that her findings add to the case for a new drug policy paradigm based on decriminalization. Drug production has a long history of causing environmental devastation throughout Latin America , with remote (and wildlife-rich) jungle regions an excellent place to produce and transport drugs with little interference from authorities. A prime example that mirrors McSweeney's findings is Colombia, where tens if not hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest have been cleared over the years to plant coca and build cattle ranches. Toxic chemical byproducts of the cocaine production process also contaminate the surrounding area, while the aerial eradication of coca fields has indiscriminately destroyed all crops and poisoned water supplies. This latest report is not the first study to note how this impact has been spreading north into Central America. In 2012, a report by Yale Environment 360 detailed how Guatemala's Maya Biosphere Reserve in the northern state of Peten -- a sparsely populated region with limited state presence -- has been severely affected by criminal groups clearing forest for airstrips and cattle ranches. The depressing reality is that such environmental devastation is an inevitable byproduct of drug trafficking and illegal drug production. As long as demand remains high for a product with a huge profit margin, criminals will continue to need space to make and move it, and isolated wilds make for ideal locations."	1	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Why the Mexican Govts Murder Count is Worse than Useless. The Mexican government has released figures on drug-related homicides in the first two months of Enrique Pena Nieto's presidency -- Alejandro Hope explains why these numbers only get in the way of understanding violence in Mexico. This month, the government published a "" federal report of preliminary data on security indicators ."" Among other information, the document gives a count of the ""intentional homicides linked to organized crime"" in December and January. Well, wasn't that what I wanted? Didn't I write a few days ago that it was necessary to ""demand that the government make public the information [about homicides] as quickly as possible""? Yes, but not this information. The official murder count, the database of homicides linked to organized crime (formerly called ""deaths resulting from presumed criminal rivalry""), is worse than useless: it is positively detrimental to understanding the evolution of criminal violence in the country. I have already written about the topic, but the problems with this murder count have re-emerged: 1. It is not drawn from hard facts: the designation of a homicide as ""linked to organized crime"" does not result from an investigation that allows us to determine the motive. It is the product of mere inferences based on certain characteristics of the incidents or the victims (was a high-powered weapon used? was the corpse wrapped in a blanket or inside the trunk of a car? were there signs of torture? etc.). The method was, perhaps, more or less adequate in 2007, when the number of cases was much smaller, there was a limited number of identifiable criminal groups and extreme violence was essentially a thing of drug traffickers, but not in 2013, when the drug traffickers' methods have spread, the number of groups has grown, and there are twice as many homicides as six years ago. That is to say, today it is much more difficult to know what is and what is not the work of the poorly-defined ""organized crime."" This confusion is shown in the figures: the number of homicides ""not linked"" to organized crime (that is to say, the number that is obtained by subtracting the ""linked"" homicides from the total intentional homicides reported in the official National System for Public Security (SESNSP) database ) decreased 27 percent between 2007 and 2011. In an environment of generalized growth in violence, when the authorities have been overrun in much of the country, why would other types of homicides decrease? Why would bar fights, assaults that end in murder, or land disputes decrease in number? It doesn't make sense. It is more likely that the definition of ""homicide linked to organized crime"" has expanded to include multiple forms of criminal violence. 2. The count of organized crime-linked murders doesn't add anything to information that can be obtained from other official sources: between 2007 and 2011, the correlation between the ""deaths resulting from presumed criminal rivalry"" and that of intentional homicides from SESNSP was nearly perfect (0.95). The curves run almost parallel, meaning that the crime-linked figure doesn't give us anything new on the trends. If you want information about the geographic distribution of the violence (at a municipal level) or about the detailed causes of the deaths, there is the national geographic institute (INEGI) database. So why would we want a third official database? 3. It generates confusion: two official sources of information about homicides already exist (SESNSP and INEGI). The data sets don't coincide with each other, because a) they come from different records (the first from the attorney generals' offices and the second from civil registries) and b) they measure different things (preliminary investigations in one case, body counts in the other). It is not easy to explain the distinction (note: in many other countries there are differences between the two types of sources) and many people end up confused and convinced that someone is hiding information. Add another set and the confusion becomes greater: the dispute over "" Calderon's deaths "" (which are put at 60,000, 100,000, 120,000 victims) has its origin in this multiplicity of sources, and something similar could happen in Enrique Pena Nieto's six-year term. 4. It can't be compared historically (prior to 2007) nor internationally (as far as I know, no other country has a similar data set): under these conditions, it is impossible to put the information in context. Are 1,100 ""homicides linked to organized crime"" per month many or few? It appears to be a lot, but how can one know without any point of reference? 5. It allows state governments to evade their responsibilities: if the homicides are ""linked to organized crime"", then they fall under federal jurisdiction and are the responsibility of federal authorities, right? At least this is what the state governments have argued and will continue to argue. When it publishes the figures, the federal government backs this argument. Is the federal Attorney General's Office (PGR) truly able, and does it truly want, to put itself in charge of handling 70 percent of the country's homicides? 6. It criminalizes the victims: the government of Felipe Calderon was forcefully and rightly criticized for suggesting without much basis that the vast majority of homicide victims were ""members of organized crime"" and that the crimes were ""score-settling between criminal bands"". The government of Enrique Pena Nieto has just done the same or worse: in its recent report , it stated that 1,068 of 1,104 victims (97 percent) of ""intentional homicide linked to organized crime"" registered in January were ""suspected criminals."" And what is this suspicion based upon? Does the name of each one of these people appear in a crime report? Did they review the criminal records of each one of the victims? Or could it be that it simply occurred to the authorities that, if these people showed up dead, it was because they were ""involved in something""? Two to one that it's the final option (this reminds me of a general in Chihuahua who, in 2008, suggested to the media that "" instead of saying one more death, they should say one less criminal ""). For these reasons (and others), the previous government decided in 2012 to cancel the circulation (though not the production, apparently) of data on ""deaths resulting from presumed criminal rivalries"" (the publication of intentional homicide statistics continued uninterrupted). In the words of Oscar Vega , who until this past December was head of the National Public Safety System (SNSP), ""the cataloguing or the qualification of an intentional homicide as related to some type of organized crime is the exclusive right of the Public Ministry and of the judicial branch, which defines, investigates and punishes each one of those crimes The current stance is that we will only be reporting what has been derived from investigations and legal processes."" The change came late, but it was a step in the right direction: it is not good practice to present as official data something that is no more than a hunch. Now the new government, for unknown reasons, has taken a step backwards. I profoundly regret the decision and I am convinced that those responsible for it will regret it too, sooner rather than later. As we saw during Calderon's six-year term, the death count is going to sow confusion among the public and distort the discussion about the state of violence in the country, on top of providing a formidable weapon to opponents and critics of the government. Brace yourselves: since he released these figures, Enrique Pena Nieto has his war, and his own dead. P.S: If the figures in the report were bad, the manner of presenting them was worse. To make a month-to-month comparison (January versus December), without adjusting for seasonal or calendar effects, is absurd: it doesn't say anything at all about how we are doing. What's more, since the public no longer has access to the database of ""deaths resulting from presumed criminal rivalries,"" collected in the previous term, there are no points of reference (even if these would have come from a defective source). P.P.S: If they are going to present drug seizure figures, would it be so much trouble to give the breakdown by substance? Considering that in the United States marijuana has a wholesale price of less than $1,000 per kilo, cocaine $25,000 and heroin $60,000 dollars, it is important to know what drug they are talking about.

"Mexico Criminal Groups Use Violence to Control Meat Industry: Report. Criminal groups are coercing butchers at a food market in western Mexico to buy meat from them at elevated prices and are killing those who do not comply, a new report finds, illustrating one of the many ways predatory crime hinders economic activity in Latin America. Criminal groups supply most of the 60,000 kilos of meat sold every week at a market in the city of Chilpancingo, Guerrero, according to a report by El Universal. The criminal groups buy the meat at 50 Mexican pesos per kilogram and sell it to the market's butchers for 60 pesos per kilogram, for earnings of 600,000 pesos (roughly $32,000) each week. One of the butchers told El Universal that competitors offer lower prices than the criminal groups, but that buying from a competitor carries the risk of violent reprisals. Four butchers were killed in the past year alone, according to El Universal. Two vendors who worked at the market were also killed last year. Most vendors close their shops by 4 p.m., before it gets dark. They would normally stay open until 8 p.m., according to El Universal, but they fear more attacks, and few customers are willing to shop at the market during the evening. This disruption of the marketplace is common across much of the region. In 2013, Mexico's then-Secretary of Health, Mercedes Juan Lopez, said crime costs the country up to 15 percent of its annual GDP; in Honduras, that number was estimated to be 10 percent in 2012. The World Bank has identified high levels of violence as one of the major risks to economic growth in the region. Of course, organized criminal activity can also spur growth. Several billions of dollars in drug profits are laundered through legitimate businesses in Mexico every year, sparking investment and economic activity. Panama has also benefited economically from lax banking regulations that for years enabled Colombian drug traffickers to stash their illicit profits in secrecy. But predatory criminal activity undermines economies, and extortion is chief among them. A business association in El Salvador estimated that an average of two small businesses close per week because of extortion, which the International Crisis Group recently called the "" lifeblood "" of the country's street gangs. A 2015 report by Honduran newspaper La Prensa found that Central America's Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala pay over $660 million every year in extortion fees. But the use and threat of violence is not a prerequisite for having a damaging effect on the economy. Contraband smuggling is a multi-billion dollar a year industry in countries ranging from Guatemala to Paraguay. And earlier this year, watchdog groups in Brazil said contraband cost the country an astounding $41 billion in lost tax revenue and private sector losses in 2016."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Repollo and the Murderer of Facundo Cabral in the Same Narco-Network. Why did the seizure of a briefcase containing money on a secluded Costa Rican border cause so much concern to a Nicaraguan and a Salvadoran? The web of drug trafficking is so extensive that money found on a riverbank is the last link in a chain that leads to the murder of an Argentine troubadour. From the testimony of a self-confessed narco to wiretaps in Costa Rica, and an investigation that Panamanian prosecutors shared with their counterparts in El Salvador, this is an account of the links that connect Central American drug trafficking groups. On the banks of the Sixaola River, on a narrow dusty road running through the middle of sugar cane fields, a purple pearl Toyota Corolla is parked. The police that patrol this sector, known as El Catracho Margarita, do not hesitate to pull over the car because they know this river, which empties into the Caribbean Sea and is on the border between Costa Rica and Panama, is a ""hot route"" for contraband and drug trafficking. The driver accelerates, trying to escape, but the Costa Rican police capture him and his companion. They handcuff them, check the vehicle and find on the back seat a briefcase containing five packets of money wrapped in duct tape. The police suspect that this wad of cash, $362,000 in total, was meant for the purchase of drugs and that they are looking at a money laundering case; what no one suspects at that moment is that just a few days earlier, part of this money had come from the fifth floor of a Salvadoran bank. This article was translated from El Faro. See original article here. On June 15, 2008, at 11:20am, the two men travelling in the Toyota Corolla were arrested. One was a Nicaraguan named Gustavo Alvarez Lanza, alias ""Tavo,"" and the other was Joel Hernandez Mora. At first glance, the arrest of these two men was just one more case on a long list of people detained for crossing the river by boat, taking money into Costa Rica and returning with drugs or merchandise from Panama. But in this case, there was something else. When the authorities searched the glove compartment of the car, they found a series of documents that provided them with a glimpse into the way various Central American drug traffickers work together -- some provided money, others rented out their ranches, a third party corrupted police officers so that hundreds of tons of cocaine could continue moving south to north. The drug trafficking networks are so complex that the seizure of some cash on the banks of the river has a thread leading back to the accidental murder of an Argentine folk singer in Guatemala. But we will discuss that later. For the moment, we will say that the 1999 Toyota Corolla had a direct connection with El Salvador. The vehicle was registered in the name of Fausto Antonio Valladares Ramos, who at the time was 45 years old. He was a mechanic who lived in the San Jose neighborhood in San Marcos; he ran a restaurant called Aguachila and was known in the underworld as ""El Viejo Canoso"" (The Old Gray-Haired Man). What was a vehicle belonging to a Salvadoran doing on that secluded Costa Rican border? How did it get there? As the months passed, investigations suggested that in contrast to the vast Mexican territory, where various cartels fight over control of routes at gunpoint, Central America might as well be one country, where drug trafficking groups quietly coexist, without a clearly defined hierarchy, and with the money as a flag to prevent shootouts and mishaps. The Loan that Was a Front to Buy Drugs June 8, 2011. A blue Mitsubishi truck is parked at a gas station, on Kilometer 29 of the road that leads to Santa Ana. Two men say they have $110,000 to buy ten kilos of cocaine and take it to Guatemala. A third says yes, he can get hold of this amount, but at that moment he only has one kilo, of top quality, under one of the seats in the truck. They talk, negotiate, and the seller invites the buyers to get in the truck to verify the quality of the cocaine. ""Come and try the merchandise,"" the narco offers. ""It's good stuff; we can do business,"" concludes the buyer. The men discuss the fine details and then, all of a sudden, it all comes down on top of them. They are surrounded by ten anti-narcotics police. Five people are arrested and accused in court of trafficking illegal drugs. A judge sentences them to prison. One of the men arrested, accustomed to travelling to Costa Rica and Panama by plane, staying in hotels, and earning six times the minimum wage for making a simple trip to Nicaragua, cannot tolerate the hell that is prison. He wants his freedom back: he is willing to confess that he is a drug trafficker, and reveal who, on what dates, and how they moved tons of cocaine through Central America. The statement made by this witness blew the dust off the case of the wad of cash seized at the Sixaola River. The self-confessed narco said that the head of his organization was named Jorge Ernesto Ulloa Sibrian, alias ""Repollo,"" a Salvadoran businessman arrested this year in Zone 10 of Guatemala City, and accused of belonging to a Central American network that trafficked approximately 16 tons of cocaine to the United States. The day of Repollo's arrest , March 16, 2013, Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla referred to him as ""an important Salvadoran capo"" and even what he called ""the Salvadoran Chamale,"" in reference to the Guatemalan capo who was captured in March 2011, and controlled a large part of the Pacific coast departments in the country. Repollo was expelled from Guatemala for violating the Immigration Act. In the records it appeared that he left the country by the Valle Nuevo border on February 19, 2013, but there was no record of his entry into Guatemala. For this irregularity, he was expelled, and on his arrival at the Ilopango airport in San Salvador, prosecutors were waiting for him with an arrest warrant for international cocaine trafficking. Ulloa Sibrian was detained in the maximum security prison in Zacatecoluca to await the hearing that would determine if there was enough evidence to try him. Repollo is the owner of 35 properties in El Salvador that are registered in the name of his company, JE Inmobilaria, and his family. He presented himself as a builder, which allowed him to get credit from banks. The ex-employee of Repollo who could not tolerate the hell of prison had by now become a key witness, saying that these companies were a front and revealing, among other things, details about the origins of the money seized on the bank of the Sixaola River in Costa Rica. The witnessed recalled that in May 2008, Repollo applied for a $70,000 loan from Banco Cuscatlan. The bank approved the loan and two of the businessman's employees, El Viejo Canoso and the witness, went to the fifth floor of the Cuscatlan tower, located on Los Proceres Boulevard in San Salvador, to cash the checks. ""We asked for the full amount in $100 bills, but the money wasn't for construction; it was for drugs, and he [Repollo] wanted it sent to Costa Rica. He did it like this because he used to say that if they investigated him he would say that he was working with bank loans."" The $70,000 bank loan was added to the rest of the cash for a total of $390,000. The Salvadoran narcos' job was to hide the money in a truck transporting molds and a machine for installing in a factory that made Mayan ornaments, and to take it to a ranch in the coastal zone of Sixaola. Once there, they handed over the money to Tavo -- the Nicaraguan with the contacts -- to cross the river by boat and meet with some Colombians in the Panamanian city of Changuinola to negotiate a cocaine shipment. Tavo arrived at the bank of the Sixaola River in the Toyota Corolla. He parked on the dusty road, running through the middle of the sugar cane fields, and while he was waiting for the boat that would go to Panama, he was arrested by the police for the crime of laundering drug money. The news of his arrest spread like wildfire among members of the network. El Viejo Canoso, one of the Salvadorans that were near the border, made a call to San Jose, the Costa Rican capital. He said something serious had happened El Macho and his Friends The pieces of drug trafficking in Central America are so well connected that the seizure of a vehicle on the bank of a river near Panama can worry a Salvadoran just as much as a Nicaraguan. This is what happened to Kalter Corea Velasquez, alias ""El Macho,"" a policeman who was 547 kilometers from the place where the briefcase of cash was seized, but whose name appeared on a bill found in the glove box of the Toyota Corolla, raising suspicions that the six vehicles and the land he had bought in Santa Cecilia, Alajuela were the result of his adventures in the world of organized crime. El Macho, of Nicaraguan origin, joined the Cost Rican police in 1999 and at the time of the seizure of the money was working as a border guard. Road surveillance and the certainty that there will not be any problems crossing the border is one of the goals aspired to by all drug trafficking organizations. This is why these structures spend a good part of their money on state officials, with the objective of having the path clear for their cocaine shipments. El Macho did not resist this temptation and was recruited by a businessman who had a farm right on the Costa Rican border with Nicaragua. This businessman, who worked growing and transporting oranges, is called Allan Alvarez Roca, alias ""El Negro."" He is a dark man with a moustache and a round face, who for some time had a direct deal with the Colombian former guerrilla Libardo Parra , who would share good money with whoever helped him take shipments to the shore of Lake Nicaragua, where they were collected by a boat. To the Costa Rican policeman, the offer seemed irresistible: $2,000 for providing security for the cocaine loads and for leaking information about any anti-narcotics operations. This is how businessmen and police worked for several months -- trafficking drugs and even attending the area's bull fights and festivities together. The calm with which they trafficked drugs and went to parties was broken on June 15, 2008. That day, investigators found a bill in the name of El Macho and also a voucher belonging to Claudio Rodriguez Roca, the father of the businessman that coordinated the cocaine trafficking, inside a Toyota Corolla. Over the course of several months, documents appeared confirming that the case was linked to a Central American group that trafficked cocaine. On October 13, 2008, Costa Rican intelligence services wrote a report about El Macho: ""He is an official from the northern command of La Cruz Confidential sources say he has property on the Costa Rican border, some 300 meters from Nicaragua. The aforementioned property is on the limits and is used as a path that goes to the main route to Cardenas, the southern shore of the Lake of Nicaragua. The Costa Rican police then tapped the phones of El Negro and El Macho. The scene was set for drug seizures and arrests The Death of El Borracho August 13 2009. Several months have passed since the operation on the Sixaola River. Joel Cantillano Bustos, a habitual drinker, is driving a truck towards the village of Santa Elena, on the border between Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and in a case he is carrying 78 packets of cocaine. The police arrest him and this, for the group of narcos he belongs to, is like stirring up a hornets' nest. One, two, three ten phone calls between them. The police have spent a year and a half listening to phone calls and they believe they have managed to decode the narco-language. They believe ""El Borracho,"" (the drunk) is Joel; they believe the phrase ""the kids are here,"" means the cocaine is already in the storehouses; they believe ""move the posts and the wire,"" is to transport loads; and they also believe that when someone says ""the bill is ready,"" it means they have already been paid for transporting the white powder to Nicaragua. And this belief is based on one fact: the seizure of the 78 packets. Hours after the detention of El Borracho, the police intercept a call between one of El Macho's lieutenants -- the policeman who couldn't resist a bribe -- and El Negro -- the businessman who coordinated the movement of cocaine. ""I was calling him and I never got hold of the big asshole,"" says El Negro. ""No, no, he wasn't there, he was by the river."" ""Man, don't you see he died, the old drunk!"" ""And son of a bitch!"" ""I went to the wake yesterday, and the burial is today."" ""Imagine that, son of a bitch, was it the booze?"" ""The booze he started drinking Wednesday, he died yesterday."" ""What an old fool."" ""They told him he was going to die fucked up and he didn't pay attention."" ""But, but it was true, then?"" interrupts the police officer, Corea. ""Yes, it was true."" ""Ok, well, we'll be in touch then."" ""What do I say to the old drunk?"" asks El Negro, before finishing the call. ""What are you going to say? God be with you"" ""Ha, ha, ha."" ""Give him a bottle of booze, so he'll wake up with it on the other side."" The phone calls with El Borracho implicate the rest of the gang. There is a trail of phone calls and documents linking police and businessmen. The ties were so obvious that even the US anti-narcotics agency asked to investigate the case. In August 2009, a report by Special Agent Joseph Maccaffey noted the names of the people who, without any problems, trafficked drugs between Santa Cruz de Guanacaste and Upala, in Alajuela. The names of El Negro and El Macho were mentioned repeatedly. Their days are numbered El Palidejo Appears There was a day when the negotiations between El Negro and the Colombian Libardo -- an ex-guerrilla from the M-19 organization -- broke down, and the criminal group had to look for a new ally. It began in 2009 when the police and the businessmen from Santa Cecilia decided to do business with ""Tony,"" a man who prided himself on being a heavyweight in the world of drug trafficking because of his grand friendships with high-ranking military men, police, and politicians in Nicaragua -- which is what the ex-police officer Kalter Corea wrote in his confession on April 1, 2012. Tony's real name was Alejandro Jimenez, alias ""El Palidejo."" In 2009, the name of Alejandro Jimenez was unknown, and the public only discovered his existence after July 9, 2011 -- the day the Argentine folk singer Facundo Cabral was assassinated in Guatemala City. In 2009, El Palidejo moved freely though Central America, because he had not yet faced the accusation that he was the intellectual author of the attack in which Cabral died -- an attack targetting old associates of his who had wanted to steal parts of his drug trafficking business, including businessman Henry Farinas, who was the host and sponsor of the concert that Cabral had recently played in Guatemala. El Palidejo used a false Nicaraguan ID and rented a house in Managua, which had a pool and a large garage, where he kept various cars with hidden compartments for transporting cocaine; among them a single cab Toyota Hilux. El Palidejo proposed to El Negro that he take charge of moving the shipments to Liberia in Costa Rica, and that once inside Nicaraguan territory, he would be in charge of transporting them to Managua, where he would hide them in vans to later take them to Honduras, leaving from the municipality of Jalapa in northern Nicaragua. This deal, though, did not cut the lines of communication with El Salvador. Instead, the men that worked for El Negro continued working as Repollo's principal agents in Costa Rica. Both El Palidejo and Repollo were clients of the same corrupt men. The Salvadoran prosecutors' key witness recalled, for example, that El Macho -- the policeman that accepted bribes to facilitate the movement of shipments from Costa Rica to Nicaragua -- used a blue Hyundai Porter pick-up to move a load. The operation was a failure. The 78 kilos were seized and one of the organization's men -- El Borracho -- was captured. El Macho has confessed that his organization was one of the pieces of the same puzzle. During about seven months, until July 2009, the group of narcos that El Negro led was the hinge that opened the door for cocaine to pass from Costa Rica to Nicaragua. Both were clients of the same corrupt men, until the day that El Palidejo decided it was the moment to look for a new alliance because he needed to move more tons of cocaine. El Palidejo is not mentioned any more than this in El Negro's confession before the Court of Cassation of Guanacaste in Costa Rica. El Negro, for his part, looked for a new contact to traffic cocaine and he found it in Alexander Leudo Nieves, a Colombian that ended up in San Sebastian prison in Costa Rica in 2011. The ex-policeman's confession ended with this phrase: ""If this is not the whole truth, I don't know the rest. Judge for yourselves."" The Panamanian Narco that Visited San Salvador Sometimes, drug traffickers in countries like Costa Rica, Nicaragua or Honduras are a bridge by which you can find a shortcut. In the drug business, there is no monopoly, there is no blind loyalty, and local drug trafficking groups are not useful for every side of the business. For example, in Costa Rica, one of the most consistent associates of Repollo was the group led by El Negro, but it was not the only one. According to information in the hands of Salvadoran authorities, Repollo began to traffic cocaine around 1998. Using a contact, Jorge Salazar, he would buy one or two kilos in Nicaragua. As his business grew, so did his list of contacts. After Nicaragua, he met his first Costa Rican contacts and, finally, made deals with a fat Panamanian with black wavy hair, who is called Carlos Ivan Gomez Figueroa but is known by his associates as ""El Chombo."" El Chombo's organization was the group that was going to receive the $362,000 the police seized on the shores of the Sixaola River. One witness said in his declaration that Repollo bypassed the intermediaries led by El Negro and went to negotiate directly in Panama. As a result of these negotiations, El Chombo visited San Salvador. Lacsa Flight 622 arrived at the El Salvador International Airport in Comalapa from Costa Rica on December 30, 2010. One of the passengers that got off the plane was El Chombo. When a Salvadoran immigration official asked what the reason for his visit was, he said he had come for tourism, but in reality it was business -- to hash out the details for an illegal business called cocaine trafficking. El Salvador was not a strange place for El Chombo. A year before, in 2009, the General Directorate of Immigration reported that this Panamanian had entered the country three times for tourism. El Chombo stayed in the Hotel Alameda, on the Alameda Roosevelt in San Salvador and waited for the next day to come so he could claim that a Salvadoran narco had not paid him for the transport of 745 packets of cocaine. The claim was directed at Repollo, who far from showing his authority as a Central American capo -- as he was described by police at the time of his capture -- accepted the debt and agreed to negotiate its payment, according to the prosecutors' key witness. The visit of El Chombo to El Salvador shows that drug trafficking groups move in distinct orbits and occasionally they meet. There were moments in which Repollo moved money to Costa Rica, so El Negro's group sent them merchandise, but there were also moments in which Repollo preferred to move his employees to Panama and negotiate directly with El Chombo, as he did in February 2010, when he moved 275 kilos of cocaine through the city of Paso Canoas. Based on these transactions, we can say that there is not a monopoly on cocaine in Central America. Every group, in each country, takes care of its own backyard. El Chombo, for example, saw the necessity of contracting the drug transport services offered by the police officer Kalter Corea -- he contracted his pickup to take packets of cocaine from a Costa Rican beach. He did not need threats, or guns to move his merchandise, the only indispensible thing was money, and that came from the leader of each group. This was what was described by the Costa Rican police in a report, which stated: ""It is unarguable that divisions exist between collaborators from each group, which are only linked by the leaders."" After charging him for the transport of 745 packets of cocaine, El Chombo spent New Year's Eve in the company of Repollo. The next day, he went to the beach. The Panamanian left the country on the night of January 7, 2011, and went on working and enjoying himself for his last 11 months of freedom. On November 18, 2011, El Chombo and two others were arrested in the city of La Chorrera in Panama. The police caught them red-handed: they were hiding 27 packets of cocaine in the gas tank of a white Toyota Hilux pickup. One of the arrested men said in his defense that he was going to Puerto Camito, and he found the sacks of cocaine lying in the road. They did not believe him. El Chombo was sent to court, but not before officials confiscated a Digicel cell phone chip from El Salvador the drug trafficking ecosystems need to remain in contact. * This article originally appeared in El Faro.

Drug Allegations May Sway Venezuela Election Outcome. A string of recent drug trafficking allegations against top figures in Venezuela's ruling political party could have a serious impact on the country's pivotal upcoming elections. According to El Nuevo Herald , US authorities are investigating Walter Jacobo Gavidia, a Caracas Metropolitan Area judge and son of Venezuelan First-Lady Cilia Flores, for suspected drug trafficking. The report follows closely the arrest of two of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's relatives in Haiti, and their subsequent extradition to the United States on drug trafficking charges. After their arrest, Efrain Antonio Campo Flores and Francisco Flores de Freitas spoke extensively with authorities, El Nuevo Herald reported, citing sources close to the case. The two allegedly gave information on their drug trafficking network, as well as details on the group's money laundering operations. They also purportedly mentioned the head of Venezuela's National Assembly Diosdado Cabello and Aragua state governor Tarek El Aissami as accomplices, the sources stated. US investigators already suspect Cabello and El Aissami as major players within Venezuela's drug trafficking underworld, El Nuevo Herald added. Cabello has also recently been accused of money laundering by Panama's former ambassador to the Organization of American States Guillermo Cochez, who was set to file a formal criminal complaint with Panama's Attorney General on November 18, reported EFE. According to El Nuevo Herald's sources, US investigators have sealed indictments for a number of other Venezuelans, but are still withholding names. Drug trafficking allegations against those close to Venezuela's President Maduro, as well as other members of the ruling socialist party (PSUV), occur in the context of Venezuela's upcoming December 6 parliamentary elections. The PSUV is anticipated to do poorly, with a recent poll showing 63 percent of voters favoring the opposition, and only 32 percent the PSUV. Allegations against high-ranking PSUV officials, and their associates, may tip this balance further. Already, surveys suggest a growing percentage of Venezuelans believe government agencies are involved in drug trafficking and organized crime. As such, continued suggestions of official corruption may feed into popular frustrations over the country's economic issues and rampant crime , turning voters against Maduro's party on election day. A loss at the polls would be of serious concern for PSUV officials implicated in criminal activity, especially if the US does possess sealed indictments, which could open the possibility of fates similar to Campo Flores and Flores de Frietas. Moreover, these two men reportedly face up to 30 years in prison, and may be feeling the pressure to provide names and other valuable information to the US Drug Enforcement Administration in a bid for leniency.	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"On the Trail of the Cocaine Backpackers in Peru. A recent report on cocaine ""backpackers"" in Peru reveals the workings of a low-tech trafficking technique that is on the increase again, as security forces destroy illegal air strips and seek to restrict the use of drug flights from coca-producing areas. A 2014 report by Peru's Information and Education Center for the Prevention of Drug Abuse (CEDRO) looked at the Peruvian drug runners, or ""backpackers,"" are often forced into the trade by ""severe economic problems."" They earn a living by transporting coca via the ""hormiga"" (ant) system, where lots of mules move small quantities in backpacks from the coca-producing regions -- like the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valleys - known as the VRAEM (see map). The center interviewed 33 mules, all male, with an average age of 32, nearly all in prison on drugs related charges. The majority stated that they had been unable to complete their education due to poverty. While some of the journey may be made by foot, the backpackers also move by bus or using other vehicles. Groups generally vary from one to 15 people carrying between seven to 15 kilos of drugs each. One interviewee reported earning $35 per kilo for a single journey. They often rely on protection from the guerrillas of the Shining Path, to whom traffickers pay $5 per kilo, as well as often bribing police. The use of ""backpackers"" became widespread after the CIA's Air Bridge Denial (ABD) program in the 1990s, which effectively restricted aerial drug trafficking from Peru to Colombia. Peru at this time was the foremost producer of coca in the world, a title it reclaimed last year. The Air Bridge Denial program was suspended in Peru after the accidental shoot-down of a plane carrying US missionaries in 2001. Since that time another major air bridge has appeared, flying Peruvian cocaine and coca paste into Bolivia , where it is later shipped to Brazil and Argentina to feed domestic markets or to be trafficked on to Europe. SEE ALSO : Peru News and Profiles There are ongoing operations to shut down this route by destroying airstrips as part of a coordinated anti-narcotics campaign in the VRAEM, which could lead to the ""ant"" system being revitalized. However, Peru no longer has previous level of US radar and intelligence support, meaning it cannot track drug flights and is currently reliant on blowing up airstrips. These can be rebuilt more easily than they can be destroyed, and also the traffickers just use the backpackers to move shipments to air strips a little further from the coca producing areas and anti-narcotics operations, continuing to feed the air routes that move an estimated 1.2 tons of cocaine every day."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Closing in on Colombias Madman?U.S. and Colombian authorities have chalked up a series of victories against the organization of one of Colombia's most prolific drug traffickers, Daniel ""El Loco"" Barrera. Operations ""Deep Water"" and ""Final Flight"" targeted the smuggling networks of Barrera , known as ""El Loco,"" or the madman. He is one of the most enigmatic and successful of the latest generation of Colombian drug traffickers, and thought to be responsible for the shipment of over 100 tons of cocaine a year. Operation Deep Water saw the arrest of 19 people, all believed to be part of a network that built semi- and fully submersible drug submarines, capable of moving multi-ton loads each trip. These vessels are almost impossible to detect without sonar radar, and have become the preferred method of moving drugs by sea, replacing the high-speed, go-fast boats that once streaked through the Caribbean and Pacific oceans. ""This was a criminal enterprise dedicated to the trafficking of cocaine with semi-submersible and submersible vessels built in the jungles of Colombia, capable of transporting up to 10 tons of cocaine,"" said the Colombian attorney general, Viviane Morales. Operation Final Flight targeted aerial drug transport routes. Authorities captured 30 people, and seized 21 aircraft linked to this network. Many of these aircraft had been stolen in Brazil and sent to Colombia to move cocaine shipments. Morales said that these two operations constituted the most serious blows to drug trafficking in recent years. More than 50 people have been arrested in connection with these investigations, the vast majority in Colombia, with six in the United States and one in the Dominican Republic. At least 29 of those arrested have pending extradition warrants to the U.S. The operations targeted four different drug trafficking structures, each one based in a different Colombian city -- Bogota, Cali, Barranquilla and Villavicencio -- all with ties to Barrera. Part of the ongoing offensive against Barrera's operations saw the seizure, on 30 August, of a ton of cocaine *at a farm in Obando, Valle del Cauca. Valued at $25 million, the drug shipment was bound to Central America, to be delivered to Mexican transnational criminal organizations. Police stated that the seizure was possible thanks to an informant, but it is clear from the recent wave of operations against Barrera that the security forces, most likely those of the United States, have managed to penetrate the drug lord's criminal empire. The chief of the Colombian National Police, Oscar Naranjo, stated that the capture of Barrera, who has a reward of more than $2.5 million on his head, is inevitable. He said that Barrera was working with the Mexican Sinaloa Cartel , led by Joaquin Guzman, alias "" El Chapo ."" However, international intelligence agencies told InSight Crime is that Barrera is based in Venezuela, where he enjoys high-level protection from members of the Venezuelan security forces and political elite. This is supported by the fact that the Colombian police recently delivered information to the Venezuelan authorities about the location of several illegal airstrips within Venezuelan territory, used by Barrera's networks. Colombian Police General Carlos Ramiro Mena said that the air strips were in the frontier provinces of Apure and Tachira. Flights landing here can refuel before heading either up to the Caribbean coast and on to Central America, or making the trek across the Atlantic to West Africa, and then to the European market. Barrera has always been an atypical drug trafficker, lacking a large military force and instead relying on alliances and deals with other criminal organizations. In the past he has worked with rival factions in the Colombian conflict; with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ), and at the same time with their bitter rivals, the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC ). He continues to work with the FARC, and is known to have ties to another of Colombia's most powerful drugs trafficking organizations, the Rastrojos. While the core of Barrera's operations is in Colombia's Eastern Plains, particularly the province of Meta, his drug smuggling activities are nationwide, incorporating land and sea operations, and moving cocaine from both the Pacific and Atlantic seaboards.

"Paraguay Investigates Ex-Fugitive Drug Lord Politician. A Paraguayan politician, who previously served time in prison for drug trafficking, is now under investigation for money laundering, a case that is representative of the new breed of criminals feeding the Southern Cone's drug trade. A new inquiry has been opened into the origins and value of certain possessions (including ranches, livestock, planes, cars, and gas stations) belonging to Carlos Ruben Sanchez Garcete, alias ""Chicharo"" -- what a Paraguayan state prosecutor says is ""technically money laundering,"" reported ABC. According to new documents and evidence, Chicharo was making monthly transactions of over $200,000 through one bank account alone. Chicharo -- who is a member of the right-wing Colorado Party and an alternative congressional representative for the border state of Amambay -- has had frequent encounters with the law in Paraguay and neighboring Brazil in recent years. He first came to the attention of Brazilian authorities in 2000, when a man transporting almost 2,500 kilos of marijuana camouflaged in a shipment of wood was arrested. Investigations showed that Chicharo was the owner of the sawmill where the truck had been loaded. Then, in 2008, Brazilian Federal Police arrested Chicharo on charges of money laundering and smuggling; two years later, he was sentenced to four years in prison. In an interview, Odilon de Oliveira, the judge who sentenced Chicharo, said, ""He is a drug trafficker. I recognize in my sentencing that this is definitive."" However, Chicharo -- who goes by the name Adriano Lopes Bordon in Brazil -- was able to flee back to Paraguay, and, still a fugitive from the law in Brazil, decided to successfully run for office with the Colorado Party. Yet roughly five months after he was elected, Paraguay's anti-drug authority, known as the SENAD, arrested Chicharo in a small town along the Paraguay-Brazil border. Although there were standing orders for his extradition to Brazil, his prison sentence was transferred to Paraguay. After serving time in the Tacumbu prison, he was released in September 2014, and is now under house arrest. Nonetheless, in July 2014, a plane linked to Chicharo (still in prison at this time) that was carrying drugs made an emergency landing -- killing two women and a child who were riding down a road on motorcyles. The plane -- allegedly flown by three Paraguayans and a Brazilian -- was unloaded of its cargo and abandoned. Some time later, Chicaro allegedly contacted the mother of two of those killed by the plane, offering financial compensation in exchange for her not speaking to authorities. The drug plane that crashed into several pedestrians in 2014 in Paraguay, killing three. c/o ABC Color Ongoing investigations into Chicharo have determined he is the right-hand man of Luiz Carlos Da Rocha, alias ""Cabeca Branca,"" who is considered the successor of Fernandinho Beira Mar, one of the main drug suppliers in the region. Chicharo has been at the heart of the expanding drug trade in Latin America's Southern Cone region, and he is not the only Paraguayan drug trafficker to play such a role. Brazil's status as the world's second-largest market for cocaine has fueled a criminal network in South America thought to pull in $9 billion a year from drug sales, according to one estimate. Chicharo is just one of these little-known figures who is driving a very profitable transnational drug trade that competes with that of the US. Chicharo's ability to move into politics despite his long criminal history also demonstrates the weakness of Paraguayan institutions in competently investigating and prosecuting those involved in the drug and contraband trade, with corruption among government officials running deep. Indeed, the failure to fully bring Chicharo to justice -- and his ability to run for office despite being a fugitive in Brazil, as well as continue trafficking operations from prison -- is a troubling indicator of where things may be headed in the region."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Missing Girls Case Highlights Sex Trafficking in Argentina. A case involving a woman's search for her daughter, believed to have been kidnapped by a human trafficking ring 10 years ago, has gripped Argentina, shedding light on how the sex trade operates inside the country. Twenty-three-year-old ""Marita"" Veron was kidnapped in Argentina's northern Tucuman province in 2002. Since then, her mother, Susana Trimarco, has become one of Argentina's most visible lobbyists against commercial sexual exploitation. In recognition of her activism, the US State Department granted her the International Women of Courage Award in 2007. Thirteen people are currently on trial in connection with Veron's disappearance. Her mother testified in court on February 15, describing her search for her daughter over the years. While attempting to trace Marita's whereabouts, Trimarco visited brothels across the northwest, pretending to be a former prostitute looking to recruit other sex workers. She said she spoke with women who'd met Marita, who had been beaten, drugged and abused. She testified that her daughter apparently had a child with one of her kidnappers, and was ""given cocaine so that she could work more,"" according to El Nuevo Herald. As the trial wrapped up on February 16, Veron's lawyer said in his closing statement that there was evidence that Marita was dead. Some of the 129 women whom Trimarco rescued from the sex trade have reportedly said that Marita may be in Spain, according to an IPS report. The exchange of sex for money is legal in Argentina, but organized prostitution, including brothels, is not. And while Argentina has effectively outlawed all forms of human trafficking, under current legislation many cases end up being dismissed if the victims initially gave their consent. The Veron case calls attention to one form of human trafficking inside Argentina: the abduction of women to work in the sex trade. In such cases, as detailed by an Infosur report , potential victims are typically picked out by neighbors, street vendors, or cab drivers who work as ""look-outs"" for sex trafficking rings. The victims are then assaulted in the street, forced into a car, and taken to a hide-out, as reportedly happened to Veron when she disappeared in 2002. Afterwards, the women are sold to brothels, or are forced to work rotating shifts at multiple sex dens. This type of sexual exploitation is most common in northwestern provinces like La Rioja (where Veron reportedly ended up) and Tucuman, as well as north-central regions like Mendoza and Cordoba. The phenomenon has also been reported in southern Argentina, where many areas have a low population of women. But asides from kidnapping, many women are tricked into working in Argentina's sex trade. Women may be promised work in legitimate trades, and, if they live overseas, recruiters to make the travel arrangements. The women then arrive and are forced to work in the sex trade in order to pay off the travel debt they have supposedly incurred. Women and girls from Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, the Dominican Republic, and Bolivia have been ""imported"" into Argentina's sex trade in this manner. If Veron's trial ends with a conviction, it will be an unusual outcome for a sex trafficking case. According to the US State Department , in 2010 Argentina obtained just 15 convictions on sex trafficking offenders, up from three in 2009. For many in Argentina, Veron and Trimarco have already become the public faces of forced prostitution. A victory for them, while highly symbolic, should not obscure the fact that Argentina has a long way to go in fighting sexual exploitation. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"InSight Map: Arms Trafficking in Bogota. The black market for firearms in Bogota made profits of approximately $4.9 million between 2009 and 2010, according to city officials. InSight has developed a map showing that many of the center points for arm sales are located on the city's outskirts, near the major exits points to one of Colombia's most conflicted regions, the Eastern Plains Authorities in Bogota seized 5,177 weapons last year, according to daily newspaper El Tiempo , including grenade launchers, machine guns, rifles and pistols. The weapons most in demand are 9mm pistols and 7.65 semi-automatics, and .32 and .38 revolvers, city officials told the newspaper. Similarly to Medellin, where the troubled barrio Comuna 13 has long been a centerpoint for gang activity and weapons trade, due to its proximity to Highway 62 leading all the way to the coast, much of the arms activity in Bogota appears to be based in the southeast, which is the gateway to the Eastern Plains. This offers easy access to Villavicencio and onwards through Meta, where both the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) and the Popular Antiterrorist Army of Colombia (Ejercito Popular Antiterrorista de Colombia - ERPAC) remain active. Bogota has a lower homicide rate compared to Cali and Medellin when it comes to homicides committed by firearms. What may make the city an important center for the arms trade, especially for the rural southeast, is because Bogota is after all the logistical capital for the armed forces. The military and police are not thought to be a major source of arms for criminal groups, but corruption does exist. Fudged inventories would allow seized weapons to recycle back into the city's black market. There are two types of weapons trade in major cities like Bogota and Medellin: the most common involves the renting of arms for short periods of time, most frequently for hired assasins looking to avoid using a traceable weapon. Criminals also rent weapons for small-time jobs like robberies or bus hijackings. Depending on the type of firearm, renting a weapon can cost anywhere between 100 thousand pesos (about $52) and 1.5 million pesos (about $786), while purchasing a gun will cost between 165,000 pesos (about $87) and 37 million pesos (about $19,400), El Tiempo reports. The second type of urban weapons trade involves illegal groups looking to expand their arsenals. The drug-trafficking bands descended from the paramilitaries, called ""criminal bands"" (bandas criminales - BACRIMS) by the government, are believed to represent one of the greatest demands for weapons on the black market. The arsenal for BACRIMS consists mostly of recycled weapons which were never turned over to the government during the demobilization process. The FARC and the National Liberation Army (Ejercito Nacional de Liberacion - ELN) have also tyically represented a major demand for weapons in the black market. But there are indications that with the decline of the power of these groups, many guerrilla fronts are making do with older model AK-47s and Galil assault rifles. The typical source of weapons for these groups has been arms coming in from the international market, occassionally diverted illegally from the arsenals of the security forces in neighboring countries like Peru. InSight has developed a map showing the center points of the weapons trade in Bogota. The blue placemarks represent the areas where the most weapons were seized last year. The red placemarks represent the areas where weapons are reportedly most commonly bought, sold and rented. View Bogota Arms Trafficking in a larger map "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"FARC, Colombia Govt Drug Agreement Doomed to Failure?As peace talks between the Colombian government and FARC rebels stumble on, a report from the Transnational Institute finds deep flaws in the May agreement on illegal drugs, with implementation difficult and little probability of improving the situation on the ground. In a report titled ""Drugs, Armed Conflict, and Peace"" Ricardo Vargas -- a research associate at the Transnational Institute -- examines the partial agreement on illegal drugs reached in May during peace negotiations between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the Colombian government. In a joint press release issued on May 16, both parties outlined the main points of the accord , which include the implementation of illegal crop substitution programs and the severance of the FARC's ties to drug trafficking. The agreement places an emphasis on the eradication of illegal coca crops and stipulates that coca growing communities will be allowed to participate in the planning and implementation of crop substitution programs. According to Vargas however, the agreement will likely have a minimal impact on the drug trade because it fails to address the root causes of the illegal drug economy. Vargas argues that illegal coca cultivation is a ""symptom of social exclusion"" and therefore cannot simply be solved by eradicating coca crops. For crop substitution to work, he wrote, communication and infrastructure deficiencies in rural areas need to be addressed, along with factors related to environmental protection. He argues that local farmers need to be given a voice in the exploitation of natural resources and other issues affecting their communities, rather than only being allowed to participate in decision-making related to coca eradication. Vargas also questions whether or not the FARC's commitment to end its involvement in the drug trade will have a significant impact on the illegal drug economy. Given the number of criminal groups involved in drug trafficking, he argues that another organization is likely to take the FARC's place. Vargas adds that the guerrilla group's absence could actually serve as an added incentive for rural farmers to continue cultivating coca, as they would no longer be taxed by the FARC. From a drug policy perspective, the report also points out the flaws in the agreement's underlying approach to illegal drugs. While the terms of the agreement indicate a belief that prohibition is the answer to the illegal drug trade, Vargas stresses that the idea of finding a ""definitive solution is unrealistic."" Instead, he writes, Colombia should consider a more comprehensive strategy involving commitments from other countries to consider regulating drugs. The report states that the current agreement amounts to ""old recipes in new packaging"" as it echoes the emphasis on prohibition that has fueled current regional drug policies. The Colombian government and the FARC have been engaged in peace negotiations since 2012 and have so far reached agreements on land reform , political participation and illegal drugs. The next round of peace talks, on victims of the conflict, is scheduled to begin on August 12. While the partial agreement reached on illegal drugs serves as a promising sign that peace negotiations are moving forward, in the event of a final agreement ultimately being signed, the drug trade measures stipulated will likely prove difficult to enact. As Vargas points out, coca cultivation is facilitated by widespread poverty and a lack of rural development in remote areas of Colombia. As a result, previous attempts to implement crop substitution programs have largely failed because of transportation difficulties and fluctuations in the prices of legal crops. Whereas drug traffickers are typically willing to retrieve coca directly from farmers, other crops require reliable access to markets , which many remote rural areas lack. According to El Tiempo, coca is replanted in an estimated 42 percent of voluntary or forced eradication cases. Meanwhile, the FARC is heavily involved in drug trafficking , which the organization uses as a means of funding its insurgency. Although the FARC's top leadership has long claimed they only impose a tax , or ""gramaje,"" on drug production and trafficking in their areas of operation, evidence strongly suggests certain guerrilla units, or ""fronts"" participate in all aspects of the drug trade. The recent capture of the commander of the FARC's 30th Front provided an illustration of the extent of the guerrilla group's drug trafficking activities. Martin Leonel Perez Castro, alias ""Richard,"" allegedly ran the group's Pacific coast drug operations, managing coca cultivation, cocaine processing, and drug trafficking routes to Central America. Perez allegedly had alliances with Mexican cartels and had previously worked with the criminal group, the Rastrojos. Vargas' assertion that the FARC will be quickly and easily replaced in the drug business is supported by reports that Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel is buying up the FARC's cocaine laboratories and other drug trade assets. There are also numerous Colombian criminal groups who will likely be eager to take over the FARC's territory, including the powerful criminal syndicate of the Urabenos. Another major obstacle to the implementation of the agreement is the likelihood elements of the FARC will criminalize at some point during or after the peace process. There are some notable examples of illegal armed groups in Colombia that have undergone lengthy negotiation processes with the government only to have certain factions fail to demobilize. The United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) signed a peace accord with the Colombian government in 2003, but factions of the organization have morphed into narco-paramilitary groups dedicated to drug trafficking and other illegal activities. The guerrilla group the Popular Liberation Army (EPL) underwent a similar process. The majority of the organization demobilized in 1991, but one faction refused to give up its weapons and has become a major player in the drug trade in the northeastern border region near Venezuela. Regardless of what is agreed upon in Havana, elements of the FARC will undoubtedly continue to profit from the drug trade after any peace agreement is reached. And unless the Colombian government invests in rural development, small farmers will likely continue to supply the group -- or any organization that might take its place -- with coca. As the Colombian government moves ahead with the peace process, it will be essential to consider whether the agreements being made are sustainable, and whether they will simply lead to a new chapter in the country's bloody drug war."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Brazil Broke Up 65 Criminal Gangs in Border Surge: President. Brazil has dismantled 65 criminal organizations operating on its borders since the start of a major security initiative in 2011, according to the president, though this success is tempered by the increasingly transnational operations of its major domestic gangs. In August 2011, Brazil implemented the $6.3 billion ""Strategic Border Plan,"" aimed at combating drug and contraband trafficking along its 16,000 kilometer border. The plan has involved security cooperation with Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. The armed forces and police have seized 360 tons of drugs and 8,000 vehicles and boats, and have located 148 clandestine landing strips over the course of the initiative, said President Dilma Rousseff. The president also announced that an extensive military border operation will be launched in May, aiming to increase security ahead of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup soccer tournament, which will take place in June. The Brazilian government has frequently hailed the Strategic Border Plan as a success. Nonetheless, there is reason for concern about the country's border security. Paraguayan authorities recently reported that Brazilian gang the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) ships 1 ton of Colombian cocaine across Brazil's borders via Paraguay each month, with an important branch of the group based in the Paraguayan border city Ciudad del Este. Also of concern is the continuing westward expansion of the First Capital Command (PCC), which is believed to have an established presence in Bolivia, particularly in drug trafficking hotspot Santa Cruz."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Military Commanders Firing Highlights Failures in Combating Paraguay Rebels. Paraguay's task force targeting the EPP guerrilla group has been assigned its seventh commander in less than four years, a sign of the country's failure to defeat the small rebel group and a worrying sign as the presence of Brazilian organized crime grows in Paraguay. Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes named Colonel Hector Alcides Grau to head the Joint Task Force (Centro de Operaciones Tacticas, better known as Fuerza de Tarea Conjunta - FTC) on May 29, reported the EFE news service. Grau is the seventh officer to take over the combined military-police unit, created in 2013 to defeat the Paraguayan People's Army (Ejercito del Pueblo Paraguayo - EPP). His predecessor, Julio Gerardo Brugada, headed the FTC for barely seven months. SEE ALSO : Coverage of the EPP Officially, the change in leadership was attributed to ""the necessity of optimizing the coordination of the operational field environment in search of efficient results."" The timing of the change-up, however, suggests instead that Brugada's dismissal was a sanction for failure. Just a few days before the announcement, the unit suffered another embarassment in its years-long campaign to wipe out the guerrilla group, which is estimated to have fewer than 150 fighters. On May 14 and 15, logistical mistakes caused the FTC to fail to intercept a column of EPP fighters in the Concepcion department where the group operates, despite intelligence on their location, according to Ultima Hora. The rebel fighters managed to escape, even though the military reportedly had them in sight for four hours. The incident, which appears to have prompted the leadership change, also led to calls to revamp the unit's strategy. A senator asked for the creation of a commission to examine the issue, and a former FTC commander advocated changing the unit's approach to emphasize intelligence gathering during an interview with ABC Color. The constant replacement of the FTC's leadership is a sign of Paraguay's inability to fully dismantle the relatively small EPP, which is a worrying state of affairs, given that Paraguay is facing the cross-border expansion of Brazil's most powerful criminal organization, the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC). While the EPP is estimated to maintain only small number of fighters, especially in comparison to other regional guerrilla groups, it nevertheless has been able to continue carrying out attacks against state institutions, security forces and civilians. In August 2016, for instance, the EPP succeeded in killing eight soldiers in a single ambush. According to Laurie Blair, a freelance journalist who has reported on the EPP, the FTC's failure -- and the failure of Paraguayan authorities more generally -- to dismantle the group is largely due to flawed leadership and a lack of coordination between security forces. Blair told InSight Crime via email that rivalries between various security bodies have caused previous operations to run aground. ""The failure of the security services to collaborate effectively in tackling the EPP bodes poorly for their ability to deal with increasingly brazen cross-border cartels"" like the PCC, he wrote. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Paraguay Another factor could be the EPP's increasing involvement in the marijuana trade -- Paraguay is South America's top cannabis producer -- from mere taxation of drugs to direct involvement in the production, suggesting a diversification of the group's criminal portfolio. In 2015, a prosecutor publicly stated that there was evidence of the EPP receiving training from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), raising concerns that the Colombian guerrillas had encouraged their Paraguayan counterparts to follow their model of financing themselves through the drug trade. Indeed, the Colombia guerrilla group, which originally collected taxes at every step of the cocaine business, eventually developed into the main actor in Colombia's cocaine industry, helping to fund its decades-long fight against the government. However, in contrast to Colombia's mountainous jungle areas where some of the FARC's thousands of guerrilla fighters hid out during the conflict, the dozens of EPP fighters operate in an area whose topography and vegetation make it much easier for Paraguayan authorities to access and control. The fact that the EPP is so small and does not have many geographical advantages casts doubt on the military's committment to dismantling the group. As one of the main threats to state institutions and citizen security, the EPP is also the main motive for funding the army. This has fueled speculation that the military may be treating the guerrilla group as ""a convenient [and] controllable enemy,"" The Guardian explained. Blair told InSight Crime that corruption may also play a role in security forces' struggle to effectively combat the EPP, citing the possibility that the FTC may be passing ""insider information"" to the group. SEE ALSO : PCC News and Profile Within this context, the expansion into Paraguay of Brazil's biggest crime group, the PCC, is worrying for the country's future security trends. The PCC has maintained a presence in Paraguay for a number of years, but recently the gang appears to be expanding its activities there. Last month, the criminal group was blamed for the largest bank robbery in Paraguay's history -- a heavily-armed heist that brought the Ciudad del Este border town to a standstill. Meanwhile, the Pedro Juan Caballero border town in the Amambay department -- the marijuana cultivation hub where the PCC operates -- has repeatedly suffered outbreaks of violence from suspected drug-related criminal conflicts. The PCC has repeatedly been accused of causing spiking violence in Paraguay's border areas, and the group is reported to be ramping up activities both within Brazil as well as throughout the region ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Hesitant to Respond to Police Death Squad Allegations. The government of El Salvador has yet to provide a convincing response to allegations that senior officers of the national police created criminal networks within the institution that engaged in extrajudicial killings, sexual assault and extortion. The allegations resurfaced following an investigation by Revista Factum that revealed how four police officers in the Special Reaction Forces (Fuerza Especializada de Reaccion - FES) of El Salvador's National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil - PNC) allegedly participated in three extrajudicial killings, as well as the possible sexual assault of two adolescents and at least one case of extortion. The report also delved into the existence of internal communication networks in which dozens of high-level police officers exchanged information to facilitate the killings of gang members or to tamper with crime scenes in order to make executions appear to be justifiable killings. Following the publication of the investigation, Police Director Howard Cotto announced the arrest of the four policemen involved, as well as the opening of an internal investigation. Cotto said that he had also advised the Attorney General's Office (Fiscalia General de la Republica - FGR) of the investigations. On August 28, Attorney General Douglas Melendez announced that he had also opened an investigation, but did not specify whether or not he would charge the police officers with any crimes. As part of protective measures for the Salvadoran journalists who participated in the investigation, the Human Rights Ombudsman's Office (Procuraduria para la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos) said that the revelations about the death squad embedded in the FES coincided ""with findings of independent investigations that the Attorney General's Office has carried out in recent years on the PNC's performance and the actions of some of its members in extrajudicial killings."" A few hours after publication, the Salvadoran journalists who wrote the report began to receive threats from websites controlled by the police or even managed from within the State Intelligence Agency (Organismo de Inteligencia del Estado). This is not the first time that police and prosecutors have said they will look into this type of case. But it is the first time such a case directly involves the FES, the elite unit of the the police created during the current administration of President Salvador Sanchez Ceren with the explicit mandate of fighting the country's gangs. And the reporting raises serious questions about whether the unit's chain of command knew about the alleged illegal activities. Police officials told InSight Crime that the chain of command of the special forces unit includes the head of the FES and the deputy director of special forces of the police. So far, however, the investigations have not resulted in any convictions or dismissals for the officers allegedly involved. The first allegations against the police during the Sanchez Ceren administration came in July 2015 when the Salvadoran online outlet El Faro published an extensive report on a massacre perpetrated by members of the police in the San Blas estate, in the central department of La Libertad. More reports followed soonafter. La Prensa Grafica reported another massacre in Panchimalco, on the outskirts of the capital city of San Salvador, and Revista Factum reported the murder of a disabled man in the mountainous zone of Saragossa at the hands of police. In each of these cases, the response of the Salvadoran government was non-committal. The shadow of death squads has long lingered over the Sanchez Ceren administration. As part of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional - FMLN), Sanchez Ceren began his presidential term in 2014 with a public policy targeting the MS13 and Barrio 18 street gangs that included secret dialogue with leaders of both groups. InSight Crime, Revista Factum and El Faro revealed that some of those conversations involved gang leaders who the incumbent party offered money to in return for support in the elections. Very soon thereafter, and without entirely discarding surreptitious talks with the gangs, the government opted for direct confrontation with the gangs and the creation of elite units to pursue suspected gang members in neighborhoods, towns and cities where gangs exercised some measure of territorial control. One of the main tools used for this purpose has been the special police forces grouped together with members of the military in the FES. The deployment of the FES also occurred within the framework of the extraordinary security measures promoted by congress with a push from the executive branch, which included the indefinite use of the military in matters of citizen security, tightening prison restrictions and opening space for misconduct in cases related to gangs, which the legislature had previously declared terrorist organizations. Shortly after the deployment of the FES, allegations began to surface that some policemen were executing suspected gang members, and with the consent of mid-level commanders, tampering with crime scenes to make it look like the deaths were the result of a confrontation or shooting. As a result of this policy, alleged armed clashes have been increasing in El Salvador since 2015. Between January and August 21, 2017, 293 gang members have been killed in 346 gunfights, according to PNC Director Cotto. While no police officers were killed in these clashes, 17 officers have been killed at the hands of gang members in 2017. After the first investigations were published, the international community voiced concerns that the Salvadoran government was tolerating, or even encouraging, an extermination policy. The Sanchez Ceren administration has always said that these were isolated incidents and that the death squads were almost always formed by civilians who supported self-defense groups. The authorities have always denied that the extrajudicial execution of suspected gang members is an institutional policy or, much less, a state policy. Vice President Ortiz repeated this sentiment on a radio show on August 28. But this time the revelations are clearer and more serious. They show that the alleged perpetrators of the crimes are part of a group that acts within the police. Moreover, the group exists within an elite unit endowed with extraordinary resources and directly supervised by the presidency."	0	1	0	1	1	0	0
"Guatemala Business Tycoon Busted for Tax Fraud. One of Guatemala's most important business figures has been arrested for tax evasion, as the corruption scandals that have rocked the country's political elite appear to be expanding to encompass prominent members of the private sector. Carlos Enrique Monteros Castillo, owner and president of the Camino Real hotel chain, was apprehended July 9 at Guatemala City's international airport in connection with ""tax fraud and special tax fraud"" related to his company, the Attorney General's office reported. Camino Real S.A.'s administrative manager, Jose Humberto Jimenez Contreras, was arrested at his home in Guatemala City. On July 13, a judge ordered Jimenez Contreras into house arrest and gave the prosecutors office one month to make its case against him. Camino Real owner and legal representative Monteros Castillo was detained upon returning from the United States and taken to a courthouse holding cell w here he stayed briefly before moving to a private hospital for medical reasons, Prensa Libre reported. The charges stem from an investigation begun in 2012 after the Superintendent for Tax Administration (SAT) informed prosecutors that audits had uncovered irregularities at the firm, the Attorney General's Office said in a statement. Authorities allege that the hotel executives used an intermediary named Norman Tejeda, who administered some 70 shell companies and ""sold receipts for a percentage to simulate purchases and evade taxes ."" Monteros Castillo was arrested late Saturday and by Tuesday the government had been paid the equivalent of approximately $5.9 million in back taxes, interest and penalties, Prensa Libre reported. The latest statement on the case from the Attorney General's Office did not specify whether or not the hotel owner was still under arrest. This high-profile tax evasion case follows a series of corruption scandals involving the country's top political leaders. Corruption charges brought by the Attorney General's Office and the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG) led to the resignation and jailing of President Otto Perez Molina and his vice president, Roxana Baldetti. Perez Molina and Baldetti have been charged with running a huge customs fraud scheme, collecting bribes from a Spanish port management firm, and receiving vacation homes and other extravagant gifts from members of their cabinet, some of which were purchased with purloined public funds. Digging into the administration's dealings prosecutors uncovered that they came to power under the banner of the Patriot Party (Partido Patriota - PP) via massive campaign finance fraud that spawned a the case dubbed Cooptacion del Estado. ""It was easy for the criminal structure of the PP to get into power thanks to the financing of all manner of businessmen,"" according to CICIG. Among the accused was prominent banker Flavio Montenegro Castillo, who promptly resigned as general manager of Banco G&T Continental. The bank describes itself as Guatemala's second biggest financial group. The president of Banrural, Fernando Pena, was also charged in that case. Not long after announcing the cooptation case Attorney General Thelma Aldana complained of receiving threats. She has been outside of Guatemala for the past three weeks. That authorities are targeting big fish in the private sector as well as the government signals a willingness to root out deeply entrenched corruption even among the rich and powerful. Aldana's absence may be an indication that that battle is far from won."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Can Peru Congress Make Narco-Pardons Case Against Ex-President Stick?Peru's Congress is opening a debate on what to do with the findings of an investigation into a pay-for-pardons scandal that implicates two-time President Alan Garcia. However, with the case against Garcia already thrown out on a technicality this spring, actually snaring the former head of state for involvement in a ring that allegedly accepted bribes from convicted drug traffickers will prove extremely difficult. Beginning June 12, Congress will discuss nine reports issued by the seven-member ""mega-commission"" formed in 2011 to investigate alleged constitutional infractions and corruption that occurred during Garcia's second term (2006-2011). The issue likely to be highest on the public agenda is the so-called ""narco-pardons"" scandal in which high-level officials allegedly received payment from drug traffickers in exchange for granting sentence reductions. The scandal came into the public eye in April 2013, when an early version of the commission's report found that during his term Garcia pardoned 400 people convicted of aggravated drug trafficking. That June, Miguel Facundo Chinguel, who headed the Garcia government's pardons committee, was detained on accusations of taking payments from drug traffickers. Days later the Attorney General's Office opened a preliminary investigation into Aurelio Pastor , who had headed the Justice Ministry, under which the committee was housed. Pastor had previously appeared in a video promoting the pardons system to cheering prisoners. Another member of the committee fled the country this past March. Chinguel's case is still being processed. In the mega-commission's final report ( pdf ), which was completed in December and received by Congress this January, investigators determined that Garcia had committed constitutional infractions -- exceeding his legal powers to grant pardons -- and should be investigated for the crimes of concealment and bribery. The findings and resulting recommendations were approved by the majority of the commission, in a landmark decision marking a serious effort to follow the case right to the rotten top. However, the findings were annulled in late March this year. The Fifth Constitutional Court of Lima decided Garcia's rights of defense had been infringed upon when the commission failed to inform him why he was being asked to appear to testify last year. Nonetheless, Congress has appealed the decision, and congressman Sergio Tejada, the head of the now-dismantled mega-commission, has claimed Congress has every right to debate the results in the meantime, partly so that ""the citizenry can be aware of our findings."" A Parallel Justice System According to the final report, around 30 percent of the resolutions emitted by judicial authorities during the 2006-2011 period were altered by the Garcia administration through the use of pardons and commutations. In the five-year term, 5,246 commutations were issued. Of these, 3,207 were for people convicted on drug charges, and 400 of these were for aggravated drug trafficking. Meanwhile, 232 pardons -- some common, some on humanitarian grounds -- were issued, with around 70 of the cases related to drug trafficking. The mega-commission called this an ""unprecedented"" use of this presidential authority that ""went beyond the formal limits established by the Constitution."" Under Peruvian law, the president has the power to grant pardons in limited situations, based on clauses in the 1993 Constitution and subsequent legislation. However, the Garcia administration altered existing laws regarding the objectives of the pardons committee and the use of this power, removing clauses such as ""proportional and reasonable"" and ""in accordance with the objectives of the regulations of the penal code."" It also fused the pre-existing pardons and commutations committees into one small, five-person committee and took away requirements regarding the members' professional qualifications, allowing for the hiring of any person via a ministerial resolution. According to the mega-commission, the new committee was made up of members of Chinguel's inner circle, and at one point two people previously convicted of drug trafficking worked for the committee. Garcia claimed in his testimony that the commutations were aimed partly at lowering the prison population. However, the commission noted that drug traffickers benefited most from the pardons even though they did not represent the largest prison population. Investigators also noted that the prison population grew by over 10,000 during the period. According to the commission: ""The evaluation of the information provided by the Justice Ministry allows us to support the existence of evidence that this [the pardons scheme] implied the installation of a 'parallel justice system,' with the objective of obstructing the fulfillment of sentences imposed in fair judgments on those convicted of illicit drug trafficking."" Alan Garcia: the Narco-Friendly President Garcia claimed last year that, in addition to prison overcrowding, he reduced many prisoners' sentences for reasons of conscience, and to give minor traffickers the chance to start over. However, the evidence strongly suggests that not all of those released were mere drug couriers, or ""mules."" Among those pardoned were a man convicted of owning a maceration pit and contracting others to work producing drugs for him, two men caught with numerous precursor chemicals and 1.5 tons of coca and a man a witness later identified as a local drug boss. Many of those pardoned were foreigners, among them Colombians, Ecuadoreans and Brazilians. In more than one circumstance, various people convicted as part of the same drug trafficking structure all had their penalties reduced. According to antinarcotics police figures obtained by La Republica last year, 85 convicted drug traffickers who had their sentences commuted or were pardoned by Garcia were later recaptured after being found to have continued trafficking drugs. In one case, a man who was convicted for trying to send 2.8 kilos of cocaine to Holland via public post had his sentence halved by Garcia in 2009. He was arrested again in 2013 after authorities caught him and six others along with 3.7 tons of liquid cocaine ready for export and 300 bricks of cocaine. In many cases, the ex-president cut sentences even more than the amount recommended by the pardons committee. Additionally, the mega-commission found 371 instances in which convicts already in partial liberty (no longer in prison) received commutations, and cases in which prisoners received both a commutation and a pardon. Twenty-four of those who had their sentences commuted between 2008 and 2009 later made donations in various sums to the ruling party. The commission also highlighted three cases in which Garcia issued humanitarian pardons to political figures convicted on corruption charges. While such pardons are intended to be issued only in cases in which the convict has a health condition that makes it risky to stay in prison, no such condition was proven in any of these instances. In the case of Julio Espinoza Jimenez, the former head of the country's health insurance body, the commission also found evidence Garcia had intentionally obstructed a judicial process still underway against him. Pardons Committee, or Pay-for-Pardons Network? Taken alone, these cases are enough to raise eyebrows. However, the real crux of the matter lies with cases in which witnesses named officials at the head of the pardons committee as taking payments in exchange for sentence reductions. A key witness the commission identified as 01MEGA13 claimed an organized network existed within the pardons committee -- headed at that time by Chinguel -- that demanded payments from prisoners seeking pardons. He said that ex-Security Minister Pastor's assistant negotiated the sentence reduction of Slovakian national Eugen Csorgo -- who had been caught with around a kilo of cocaine -- in exchange for $15,000. He alleged that men from this same network negotiated with a convicted member of a group that contracted drug ""mules"" and with a Peruvian drug boss who had been sentenced to 25 years. The mega-commission later found a nearly $18,000 transfer to one woman's bank account from a man thought to be a friend of Csorgo. Various convicted drug traffickers also testified that members of the committee asked them for money. Key among these was Oscar Benitez Linares -- a drug trafficker-turned-informant -- who declared in late 2012 that he was asked to pay $10,000 for each year his sentence was reduced, for a total of $150,000. According to the commission, another suspicious element of the pardons was the fact that in nine cases, people convicted for trafficking via Peru's public postal service, SERPOST, received commutations, including one prisoner who had coordinated a mail-based trafficking scheme from prison. These pardons coincided not only with Chinguel's time at the head of the pardons committee, but also his time as the director of SERPOST. A Precarious Case In his testimony, Alan Garcia insisted that while he signed off on all the cases mentioned in the commission's report, he never met with Chinguel to discuss the commutations, and that he had no knowledge of any specific decision by Pastor to favor drug traffickers. This leaves the case heavily reliant on witness testimony -- a notoriously unreliable source that has caused numerous cases in Latin American nations to unravel. While the findings are deeply suspicious, building the paper trail necessary to catch Garcia may be another matter. At the moment, it seems unlikely Garcia will face any charges at all. Although Congress has insisted on addressing the mega-commission's reports, the findings have already been nullified by the country's judicial system, and the commission -- which was dismantled following the final report -- would have to be newly formed in order to reinitiate the investigative process. This could mean Garcia, who has threatened to take legal action if Congress takes up debate and has now issued an appeal aimed at preventing the mega-commission from renewing investigations, walks away with his hands ostensibly clean. This would be a serious blow to a judicial system already compromised by alleged ties to organized crime that run right to the top. Congressman Tejada has said that any move to block debate would serve as an attempt to ""shield"" hundreds of guilty parties. The Garcia scandal means that out of Peru's last five Presidents, dating back to 1985, only one has not been accused of corruption -- and he was interim president for less than a year. Current President Ollanta Humala has himself been accused of ties to drug money , while Garcia's predecessors Alberto Fujimori and Alejandro Toledo have been wrapped up in their own human rights and corruption scandals. Only one -- Fujimori -- has been convicted. No matter what the outcome of the congressional debate on the narco-pardons, this seems unlikely to change any time soon."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
Brothel Discoveries Shed Light on US End of LatAm Sex Trade. Authorities in Providence, Rhode Island have dismantled four residential brothels this year, shedding light on the receiving end of Latin America's lucrative sex trade, which receives comparatively little attention. Police in the small northeastern US city say Mexican and Guatemalan women are trafficked from New York City on a weekly basis to residential brothels, where they are prostituted for around $30 per sex act, reported Providence Journal. These sex trafficking rings operate by giving customers fake business cards directing them to clandestine brothels run out of apartments, where victims see an average of 20 to 25 clients a day. Due to their small size, residential location, and closed networks, these types of brothels can be difficult for authorities to track, according to Leah Meyer, a specialist at the non-profit anti-human trafficking organization the Polaris Project. The victims are often paying off a debt to the traffickers and face constant threats of violence and abuse. Many are also undocumented migrants who fear being reported to authorities, said Meyer. According to statistics from the Polaris Project's National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC), in the United States as a whole the majority of sex trafficking victims come from Mexico, Central America and South America. Between December 2007 and September 2013, most of the victims who called the NHTRC, or whose cases were reported to this organization, were female and a third were underage. Reports of sex trafficking rings in Providence provide insight into life at the end of Latin America's sex trafficking routes and highlight some of the common tactics used by traffickers. The story of one Mexican migrant who was promised more money to work as a prostitute than what she was making at her previous job and never saw a dime echoes that of countless victims in Latin America who are lured by false promises , while traffickers often use cruel threats to force their victims to stay. While in the past the trade was run largely by smaller networks, in recent years, organized criminal groups have increased their role in the sex trade as they look to diversify their revenue streams. A 2011 Washington Post article highlighted the role of the Zetas in this criminal activity, while the NHTRC has reported some trafficking networks in the United States have ties to Latin American gangs like MS13, which has a presence on the US east coast.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Mudslinging, Political Violence Heralds Mexico Local Elections. Violence and political mudslinging have been spiking in tandem since the spring throughout the gangster-ridden parts of Mexico that will hold state and local elections on July 7. A video surfaced June 22 featuring the kidnapped bodyguard of Sinaloa Governor Mario Lopez Valdez, who accuses his boss and senior members of the state security forces of working on behalf of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman's Sinaloa Cartel. Frank Armenta, a state policeman attached to the governor's security detail, said he was making the accusations so ""the federal government looks at what's happening and takes action, "" against Lopez Valdez, widely known by the nickname Malova. Armenta reportedly was kidnapped June 4 by unknown assailants in the northern part of the Pacific Coast state. ""What a barbarity, that which is being done under the name of Malova,"" Armenta says in the 55 minute video, which includes telephone conversations of the governor and his top security officials that had been surrepticiously recorded. ""All these proofs I am giving you are being kept secret by the cabinet of my boss, Malova."" Lopez Valdez quickly denied the accusations, saying that Armenta had been tortured into making the video. ""If they tell him to say the governor killed Bin Laden or Michael Jackson this guy is going to say it, because he's obliged to,"" Lopez told the Sinaloa newspaper El Debate on June 27. Seated on a couch in a bare room, Armenta hardly seems stressed in the video as he provides a running commentary of the tapped phone conversations, as would a television anchor. The governor hasn't commented on the particulars of the taped conversations, whose supposedly damning content can be interpreted in less malicious ways. Neither Lopez nor anyone else has commented on who tapped the governor's phones or how they did it. Such telephone taps have been a common factor in Mexican political scandals of the past decade. Armenta claims that he was present in a 2011 meeting -- soon after Lopez took office -- in which the governor plotted with both Guzman and fellow Sinaloa Cartel boss Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada on how to provide them state protection. Guzman has been waging a bloody war ith former allies, including the Beltran Leyva clan, in many parts of the state, especially around the northern city of Los Mochis. Gunmen in early May ambushed the police chief of the town of Ahome, where Lopez once served as mayor, north of Los Mochis, killing four of his security guards. The chief, Jesus Carrasco, is named in the new video as working on behalf of Guzman. Also last week, Lopez's political coalition announced it was pulling out of local elections in Sinaloa de Leyva, a mountain township where the governor's cousin was running for mayor. The action was taken after a top aide to the candidate was murdered. ""I can certainly think that organized crime tries to get involved in the electoral process with actions of this nature,"" Lopez told reporters. The videotaped accusations against Lopez are but the most dramatic of politically related violence and accusations of corruption swirling around this weekend's local and state elections. In addition to Sinaloa, elections are being held in the crime-besieged states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Baja California, Durango, Zacatecas, and Veracruz. They're also being held in less violent states of Oaxaca, Hidalgo, Quintana Roo, Tlaxcala, Puebla, and Aguascalientes. Last week in tiny Aguascalientes, officials belonging to President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, announced they had seized a safe house belonging to the Familia Michoacana gang. The safe house reportedly contained campaign-related material supporting a mayoral candidate for opposition party the National Action Party (PAN) in the state capital. Police later admitted that they'd seized campaign posters and other material from the house promoting candidates from the PRI and a splinter party. The PAN candidate has denied any organized crime links. ""The government, the state prosecutor and the PRI of Aguascalientes could have written one of the worst scripts in the abundant history of Mexican electoral outrages,"" concluded nationally broadcast news anchor Ciro Gomez Leyva in his regular column in Milenio newspaper. He went on to call the affair ""PRI garbage."" If all politics is ultimately local, then so too is all organized crime. Favorable local and state governments can very much enhance the ability of Mexico's gangsters to operate. So it's unthinkable they wouldn't take an active interest in this Sunday's elections. That involvement hinges on the gangs' criminal interests rather than any particular ideology. But tarring an opponent with organized crime ties has long been fair game in Mexican campaigns, never more so than now amid the country's ever fractured and confrontational patchwork. The accusations against Lopez Valdez have been made before, beginning with banners hung across Sinaloa in 2011 accusing him of colluding with Chapo Guzman. But they surge again now amid investigations into the alleged corruption of ex-Governors Andres Granier of southeastern Tabasco state and Luis Armando Reynoso of Aguascalientes. Granier belongs to Pena Nieto's PRI and Reynoso to the PAN, the conservative party of just departed President Felipe Calderon. Lopez himself quit the PRI when the party failed to select him as its candidate for Sinaloa governor in 2010. Lopez won the statehouse with a multi-party coalition that included the PAN. A US federal court last Friday sentenced Mario Villanueva, a former PRI governor of Quintana Roo (which includes Cancun and the surrounding beach resorts), to 11 years in prison for laundering millions in gangster bribe money during his administration in the late 1990s. Still, apart from the accusations against Lopez, the crime-infused nastiness this year has been limited largely to former or current elected officials in smaller towns, and those campaigning to replace them. Several mayors and ex-mayors have been assassinated in recent weeks. The current atmosphere seems mild compared with the tense campaign season three years ago, that was punctuated by the assassination of Rodolfo Torre Cantu, the PRI's candidate for Tamaulipas governor, just a few days before the election. Amid the vicious war between the Gulf Cartel and Zetas, Torre's campaign caravan was ambushed by gunmen near the state capital's airport. Then-President Calderon called the assassination ""an act not only against a candidate of a political party but against democratic institutions"" that "" requires a united and firm response from all those who work for democracy."" Officials blamed rival political groups allied with one gang or the other for the attack. But the murder was never solved or even seriously investigated. Torre's brother, Egidio, was elected governor in his stead but has never pushed too hard, at least publicly, for justice in the case."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Is Central Americas Gang Violence a Humanitarian Crisis?Violence perpetrated by ""mara"" street gangs and drug trafficking groups in Central America undermines the state and leads to high homicide rates, forced recruitment and forced displacement -- an impact comparable to that of an armed conflict. A recent report by the Geneva-based Assessment Capacity Project (ACAPS - pdf ) examines the humanitarian consequences of the violence afflicting the ""Northern Triangle"" countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. It looks at how humanitarian actors can conceptualize and respond to this violence. The authors note that the humanitarian consequences of the insecurity in these countries -- which the report terms ""other situations of violence"" (OSV) based on International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) terminology -- are very similar to those of a conventional armed conflict, even if the violence does not have the same political roots. The Northern Triangle is home to gangs that maintain tight territorial and social control, are heavily armed and pose a major challenge to already weak governments. As Robert Muggah, director of Brazilian research organization the Igarape Institute, told InSight Crime by email: ""[the gangs] may not seek to usurp the state, as in conventional civil wars, but they often successfully co-opt it."" The consequences include extremely high homicide rates -- that of Honduras is higher than some states with armed conflicts, such as Sudan -- costs to human health and education, and the abandonment of homes and public spaces in areas overrun by gangs. These impacts can be hard to measure. For example, while conventional conflicts often provoke mass displacement, the forced displacement that occurs in the Northern Triangle often takes place on an individual or family basis, leading to under-reporting of the phenomenon. Virginie Andre, the head of the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department's (ECHO) Central America office, told InSight Crime in written correspondence that the lack of precise information regarding the humanitarian impacts of the violence presented a challenge for humanitarian actors. ""It takes time for actors to adjust, adapt and respond. We need to learn how to do it and give humanitarian actors the tools and conditions to do it,"" Andre wrote. The ACAPS study proposes a framework for better measuring the impact of violence in the Northern Triangle, in order to determine the most appropriate state policies and humanitarian response. The three main suggestions are: to determine more precisely the effects of violence on the population, to examine the access of the affected population to humanitarian assistance, and to measure the response capacity of both state and non-state actors. Central America's Northern Triangle countries suffer from high gang violence, with the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Barrio 18 street gangs as major protagonists. These groups exercise control in the countries' main urban centers, extorting the population and limiting their movement, recruiting children, and engaging in confrontations with each other and with security forces. They have shown signs of increasing sophistication, beginning to reorganize under a more hierarchical structure in Guatemala and using military grade weapons and infiltrating security forces in El Salvador. The US has recognized the MS13 as a transnational criminal organization (TCO), though this classification remains debatable. Security in the region has also been affected by increased drug trafficking activity in recent years, with Mexican cartels moving in and fighting to control territory in order to traffic and store cocaine. In addition to posing a direct threat to the population, both local and foreign drug groups have corrupted regional governments. For Andre of ECHO, the situation in the Northern Triangle -- with homicides, forced recruitment and forced displacement -- bears clear markings of a humanitarian crisis. Juan Pedro Schaerer, head of the Regional Delegation of the ICRC for Mexico, Central America and Cuba, wrote to InSight Crime: ""Although the causes of these violent situations may vary in character from those of armed conflicts, the humanitarian consequences are often the same, in form as in complexity and intensity."" International humanitarian aid has traditionally been greatly focused outside of urban centers, but international humanitarian agencies have begun adapting their strategies to meet the needs provoked by long-term urban violence, according to Muggah. Certain humanitarian actors, including the ICRC, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and ECHO, have all begun intervening in some OSV. ECHO, for example, invested some $2.7 million in 2013 to address violence in Mexico and Central America. According to Andre, this money was partly aimed at increasing the visibility of the problem and compiling evidence to formulate appropriate response mechanisms. However, intervention in OSV is complicated because neither the legal, conceptual nor practical frameworks for doing so are as well defined as in the case of a traditional prolonged conflict setting. For one thing, it may be more difficult to gain the acceptance of the actors involved in the violence. A particular challenge faced by the ICRC in the Northern Triangle, according to Schaerer, is that the organization is not engaged in ""systemic dialogue"" with all of those generating violence, as they would more likely be in a traditional armed conflict setting. The ICRC has moved cautiously in pilot programs implemented in cities like Rio de Janeiro , Brazil -- which also suffers from protracted violent gang activity and regular shootouts with security forces -- setting up basic health services first in order to gain acceptance from gangs before launching more comprehensive programs. ""Knowing the field"" has been key for ECHO's partners in the Northern Triangle, which include NGOs, Red Cross offices and United Nations programs, according to Andre. ""The more they are accepted in communities, the easier it is to work."" Another issue, Muggah said, is that governments themselves are reluctant to label the violence in the Northern Triangle a ""humanitarian crisis"" because this would be a tacit admission of their failure to control the situation. Instead, governments frequently resort to hard-handed and militarized policies that target the proximate causes of violence without addressing the underlying factors. When governments do not admit the scale of the problem, humanitarian actors have less space to intervene, leading many to focus on less politicized issues rather than directly targeting the violence, said Muggah. Meanwhile, the fact that urban gang violence is not currently categorized as armed conflict means that International Humanitarian Law (IHL) does not apply, something Schaerer said can limit the ICRC's work from both a ""legal and judicial standpoint."" And while defining these situations as armed conflicts would help to ensure a flow of aid to violence prevention programs, it also has the drawback of providing the organized gangs with certain legitimacy, while potentially legitimizing government killings of ""combatants."" Given these difficulties, ACAP's recommendations to measure the impact of violence are key. For Muggah, the the international humanitarian sector needs to, at minimum, ""fully acknowledge the gravity of the situation and set up appropriate monitoring facilities."" Information on questions such as the true scale of displacement will need to be established in order for the right strategies to be put in place. More complete information could also increase the response capacity of local NGOs and push states to recognize the severity of the situation. This is essential because, as Andre noted, humanitarian aid addresses only the immediate crisis. ""Above all, there is a need for longer-term solutions, addressing the root causes,"" which ultimately can only be implemented by the governments of each country."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Narco-Wives Gang Trafficked Cocaine to Argentina Via Paraguay. A group of Paraguayan women, who ran a drug trafficking ring in Buenos Aires' largest slum, trafficked drugs from Bolivia via Paraguay into Argentina, where sales brought in up to 1,000,000 pesos ($188,555) a month, one of the women told authorities. The federal judge in charge of the case, Sergio Torres, added that the gang processed and trafficked cocaine, and may also have trafficked large quantities of marijuana. The operation included a team of lookout boys, who were paid in ""paco"" (a cheap and highly addictive form of crack cocaine) to keep an eye out for police. The women also communicated at times in the indigenous language of Guarani to try and evade detection by authorities. Authorities began calling the group ""the narco-wives gang"" after discovering that two of the suspects were left in charge of the criminal enterprise after their husbands were imprisoned, reported La Nacion. One June 10, the judge ordered the pre-trial detention of four of the women in the group on charges of drug sales and trafficking. Paraguayan news outlet Amambay Noticias reported that the women, who were arrested on May 17, are Paraguayan. This is the second recent ""narco-wives"" case to gain attention in Argentina. The first gang, dismantled in April 2012, involved a trafficking ring headed by the ex-wives of two major Colombian drug traffickers , Pedro Oliveiro Gerrero, alias "" Cuchillo ,"" and Daniel "" El Loco "" Barrera. In addition to the novelty of a gang led by women, this case is notable as yet another example of Paraguay's vital importance as a transit point for drugs moving into Argentina, South America's second largest market for cocaine. In October 2012, police dismantled a gang they characterized as one of the largest drug trafficking rings in Buenos Aires , which smuggled cocaine and marijuana into the capital from Paraguay, using a bakery in Villa 21 as a front."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Alleged Zetas Ties of Mexicos Interior Minister a Liability for New Govt. As Mexico's Interior Minister, Miguel Osorio Chong is expected to help lead the government's efforts against organized crime, but allegations that he had links to the Zetas during his time as governor of Hidalgo state could represent a major liability to the new administration. Newly-elected President Enrique Pena Nieto took office on December 1, appointing Osorio Chong , a fellow Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) politician, to serve as his Minister of the Interior. The position holds tremendous importance in the country, and the person who holds it is considered the most important member of the president's cabinet. Mexico's Interior Minister is tasked with looking after internal affairs, submitting bills to Congress and serving as a spokesperson on matters of national security. The official is also the ultimate head of the country's main intelligence agency, the Center for Research and National Security (CISEN), a division of the Interior Ministry. The previous adminstration's Interior Minister, Alejandro Poire , had a reputation as a dedicated defender of former president Felipe Calderon's confrontational approach towards drug trafficking organizations, and was one of the most visible lieutenants in Calderon's ""drug war."" Pena Nieto has vowed to largely adhere to the security policies of his predecessor, there is reason to doubt whether Osorio Chong can fill this same role for the new president. Osorio Chong , who served as governor of the state of Hidalgo at the same time as Pena Nieto was governor of Mexico state (2005-2011), faced repeated accusations during his term that he maintained links with organized crime in Hidalgo , particularly with the dominant criminal group there, the Zetas. In 2010, the Mexican Attorney General's Office (PGR) opened a preliminary investigation into claims that Osorio Chong , along with several members of his administration and other political elites in Hidalgo had received payments from Zetas leader and Hidalgo native Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano , alias "" Z-3 ."" According to the allegations, the officials accepted bribes from the Zetas boss in exchange for a license to operate with relative impunity. Adding weight to these claims is the fact that the group is believed to have significantly expanded its presence in Hidalgo under Osorio Chong 's administration, deeply penetrating the state's police force. Osorio Chong vehemently denied any links to drug trafficking organizations and in 2011, just before he stepped down as governor, the PGR exonerated Osorio Chong after a preliminary inquiry. In May investigative news site Reporte Indigo reported that according to copies of bank statements two of Osorio Chong's brothers, Luis and Eduardo, had transferred nearly $8 million in suspicious funds -- an amount which cannot be explained by their licit incomes -- to HSBC bank accounts in Panama over the course of just one year. Osorio Chong again dismissed this accusation as an attempt to tarnish his reputation, and bank officials denied the existence of the account numbers listed in the report. The PGR cleared the Osorio Chong brothers in July, citing insufficient evidence. However, the fact that HSBC was under investigation at the time for facilitating the money laundering ventures of Mexican drug cartels casts doubt on the statement issued by the bank. As InSight Crime has reported , HSBC's lax controls have been shown to allow Mexican drug cartels to launder billions of dollars by transferring money to the United States. The bank likely only escaped criminal charges due to concerns that it would effect the US economy, and was forced to pay a $1.9 billion settlement instead. The allegations against Osorio Chong and his family have not gone beyond preliminary investigations, and there are currently no charges against him. Still, they hark back to the PRI's activities during its heyday in power, marked by cronyism and backdoor deals with drug trafficking organizations. Analysts and opposition politicians have already accused the PRI of considering a ""pact"" with drug cartels in order to stem violence in the country. If further evidence of such activities comes to light it will doubtlessly harm Pena Nieto 's efforts to cast himself as a fresh face in a modern, 21st century democratic party.

Rise In Women Trafficking Drugs On Mexico-US Border. There has been an increase in women trafficking drugs over the Mexico-US border, according to US officials, underscoring the continued appeal of women to drug trafficking gangs. A spokesperson for the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Agency said a rise in both Mexican and US women detained with drugs on the border had been registered, reported the Mexican newspaper El Universal. The spokesperson did not supply any statistics to the newspaper but explained that women were less likely to be stopped, especially when traveling with children. Most of the female suspects used trucks in which they carried diapers, toys or dogs to try to disguise the smell of the illegal substances, the spokesperson added, and were increasingly driving vehicles themselves rather than accompanying a male trafficker. The average age of detained women was 30, according to the CBP spokesperson. A 2010 study by Mexican non-governmental organization called the National Women's Institute found that the number of women jailed in relation to the drug trafficking trade in Mexico increased 400 percent between 2007 and 2010. Often they have family connections with gang members, and acting as a drug mule is a typical role -- though there are signs of women taking up more leadership positions. Women's tendency to attract less attention from law enforcement combined with their economic vulnerability make them ideal candidates to transport illegal drugs. These qualities have long been exploited by criminal gangs across the region, such as extortion gangs in Guatemala, a phenomenon highlighted by a Prensa Libre report last year. The number of women in Guatemalan jails has more than doubled in eight years, according to figures released earlier this month.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Cash Smugglers Who Posed as Journalists Made Multiple Trips From Honduras. A group of suspected cash smugglers posing as journalists who were arrested last week reportedly traveled from Honduras to Nicaragua on several occasions since 2010, prompting an investigation into why Honduran and Nicaraguan authorities failed to apprehend the group. According to a report by El Nuevo Diario, the 18 people arrested in Nicaragua while posing as reporters crossed into Nicaragua from Honduras and traveled down into Costa Rica multiple times since 2010. The suspects, who posed as employees of Televisa, a Mexican television network, are currently being held in Managua on charges of organized crime and money laundering. Nicaraguan police announced that the final count for the cash seized from the group's caravan of vehicles is $9.2 million. During one previous trip, the group reportedly entered Nicaragua through a border crossing in Honduras known as Las Manos, then traveled down the Pan-American Highway to Penas Blancas, Costa Rica. The border police stationed at Las Manos have been removed from their post while the chief of police in Penas Blancas has been suspended, El Nuevo Diario reported. Nicaraguan authorities are also looking into possible links between the suspects and other customs or police officials. A spokesman for the Honduran police told La Tribuna that the caravan repeatedly passed through the country without problem because the suspects took advantage of the ""considerations [given] to the press."" In response to this lapse, the director of the national police has created a special commission to investigate how the group escaped detection by Honduran law enforcement. Insight Crime Analysis Although officials have yet to report the true identities of most of the suspects, at least one of the suspects is allegedly linked to ""Los Charros,"" a Mexico-based drug trafficking network. When detained at the border, the group told customs police that they were headed to Managua to report on the trial of Henry Farinas , the Nicaraguan businessman accused of collaborating with Los Charros and other gangs to traffic drugs from Costa Rica into Nicaragua."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"El Salvador Implements New Gang Law. El Salvador's hard-line law against gang activity officially took effect on Sunday, although the Attorney General's Office told La Prensa Grafica the legislation is not yet being enforced due to technicalities. The new law doubles the maximum prison sentence for minors, declares gang membership illegal, and gives authorities permission to freeze bank accounts and seize the assets of gang members. So far the strongest reaction against the law was the three-day assault against bus companies that temporarily halted most transport across the country. New reports show that the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18, usually rivals, agreed to collaborate in enforcing the bus strike, which resulted in the destruction of three buses and the arrests of 80 people, according to IPS. The maras have rallied against the new gang-enforcement law, but have also used it as an opportunity to attack previous legislation that increased security measures in prisons. So far there is no sign the government is interested in listening, although the director of El Salvador's penal system commented to Prensa Grafica they may reconsider some of these statutes, and possibly allow rival gang members to house together in the same penitentiary. The government has tried to keep MS-13 and Barrio 18 separate since massive prison riots rocked the country in 2003. Other than the expected backlash from the Maras, one of the more preoccupying effects of the law may be migration. The Maras have already spilled over into Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras, and authorities in all of these countries have expressed concerns that El Salvador's tougher legislation will cause another mass exodus. As IPS reports, these neighboring countries are all grappling with rising homicide rates and frequent, gang-related attacks on bus companies. Honduras already has a anti-gang membership law, in effect since 2003, and Guatemalan Congress is also considering passing similar legislation. It is too early to say whether El Salvador's new bill will cause a ""balloon"" effect, but it is likely that concern over border security will grow significantly in the region. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Global Marijuana Map Shows Trends in LatAm Trade. A map showing world marijuana use and prices indicates that, in Latin America at least, both of these factors are more affected by the availability of the drug than the legal regime governing its use. The interactive map, published by the Guardian (see static rendition below), shows that Chile and Panama have mainland Latin America's highest retail marijuana prices, with the drug costing $10 or more per gram. The retail price of marijuana is also higher in Paraguay -- South America's biggest marijuana producer -- than in Brazil. Meanwhile, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Mexico have the region's lowest prices, at under $1 per gram. Paraguay is the country with the lowest wholesale price, at $20 per kilo, followed by Colombia, where the wholesale price is $40.3 per kilo. Panama, despite having one of the highest retail prices, has the third lowest wholesale price, at $50 per kilo. With the exceptions of Guatemala and Brazil, the countries with the cheapest retail marijuana also have the lowest percentage of users, at under 3 percent of residents aged 15 to 64. Use is heaviest in Brazil and Uruguay, with over eight percent of residents using marijuana. The map indicates there is little correlation between marijuana prices and rates of use. Both these factors are likely fed instead by the availability of marijuana. Mexico and Colombia are major marijuana producers. While Mexico is one of the world's biggest marijuana suppliers though, a significant amount stays in the country. In Colombia, around 70 percent of marijuana produced is destined for the internal consumer market. Most of the marijuana produced in Paraguay, meanwhile, is pumped into the large consumer markets of neighboring Brazil and Uruguay, which could explain the higher retail price in Paraguay compared to Brazil (perhaps the equivalent of paying higher prices for good coffee in Guatemala, since most of the coffee is exported). Part of the explanation for Chile's high prices could be related to increased police seizures. In 2010, the Santiago Times reported a tripling of marijuana prices, following a 107 percent rise in seizures in preceding years. Legality also appears to have little connection to price or use rates. According to the map, private consumption and cultivation is legal in Chile, yet Chile has some of the region's highest prices. Brazil and Uruguay have similarly high use rates, but personal use and possession is legal and not capped in Uruguay, while possession of large amounts is punishable in Brazil with up to 15 years in prison.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Guatemala: The Changing Face of Drug Trafficking. Drug traffickers survive under one premise: adapting to change. At the regional level, the agents of change emerge from the interaction between traffickers and the authorities, as well as among drug trafficking structures. The group that does not adapt does not survive. The result is a molotov cocktail of both planned and unanticipated consequences, in which the authorities can act as a stimulus if they are corrupt, or even if they do their job. These circumstances have reconstructed drug trafficking in Guatemala in the past five years, and led to the fracturing of some groups, the violent territorial conquest of new actors, and the displacement of traditional actors. The attack against nine policemen in Salcaja, Quetzaltenango on June 13 seemed like deja vu -- something we had seen before. But it also seemed like something more serious: a possible sign that the Zetas were making an incursion into western Guatemala after securing the Franja Transversal de Norte route -- the bridge between Honduras and Mexico -- and contesting the eastern part of the country. This article was translated from Plaza Publica. See original article here. The case involved the murder of eight police in a police substation and the kidnapping of a police deputy-inspector, Julio Cesar Garcia Crotez, of whom only three fingers and a piece of his uniform have been found. The authorities revealed to the press that Garcia was suspected of participating in a robbery of the gang that presumably carried out the attack and the kidnapping. At the same time, a police source unofficially revealed that the massacre was vengeance for the robbery of a cocaine shipment, and that while the robbery did not involve all the victims, the gunmen had killed everyone in order to leave no witnesses. On July 14, the authorities captured seven men and two women in La Democracia, Huehuetenango, who were suspected of the murders, but did not identify them as members of a particular criminal structure. Later, on July 16, a tenth suspect was captured in Chimaltenango. This time, the authorities linked him to an offshoot of the Gulf Cartel that is beleived to be active in Huehuetenango. But until the arrests, the police had suspected the Sinaloa Cartel and had given assurences that the Zetas had not perpetrated the massacre for three reasons: The first is that Quetzaltenango and Huehuetenango are territories of influence of Sinaloa Cartel associates and the killers used escape routes and even weapons that the group often uses. The second reason is that in Quetzaltenango Juan Ortiz, alias ""Chamale,"" is still in control, even though he was detained in March 2011 (and is still fighting his extradition to the United States), and that the murders were vengeance for the capture of one of Chamale's bodyguards a few days before. Finally, Huehuetenango is also the territory of other Sinaloa Cartel allies, particularly the group supposedly led by Aler Samayoa, alias ""Chicharra,"" and to which Walter Alirio Montejo Merida, alias ""El Zope,"" who was captured in June 2012 after the United States requested his extradition, belonged. However, the multiple murders would seem like an overreaction to the bodyguard's capture, given that the arrest of Chamale himself two years earlier did not provoke this kind of reaction. The type of weapons used is also a very weak indicator -- all criminal groups are able to obtain all kinds of firearms. Proof of this is that now the police are blaming the Gulf Cartel, not the Sinaloa. But what's more, according to the sociologist Hector Rosada, the territories where drug traffickers operate are not set in stone. Therefore one cannot automatically attribute something that happens in Quetzaltenango or Huehuetenango to the Sinaloa Cartel. In addition, some authorities seem to have forgotten that drug trafficking is like plasticine -- it has as many forms as hands, intentions, and events can shape it into, and one of the consequences of this is that more than one group can operate within the same province, even if it is not in the long term. The Zetas' Fingerprints The multiple murders of the police in Salcaja recalls other events in the history of drug trafficking within the country that bore the Zetas' signature. They have been familiar with the northwestern border of the country since they arrived in Guatemala in the mid-90s, when they were still part of the Gulf Cartel. What's more, according to Public Ministry (MP) records, they entered into Guatemala via Huehuetenango in December 2007, proving -- as Rosada says -- that the territories in which drug trafficking has influence are not set in stone. In November 2008, the Zetas initiated a shootout against Sinaloa Cartel allies in Agua Zarca, Huehuetenango. Later, during the first week of March, 2009, police captured two Mexican and eight Guatemalan Zetas that had stolen weapons from the National Civil Police (PNC) in Alta Verapaz and that knew how to move easily through five provinces to escape the authorities: Quiche, Huehuetenango, Solola, Totonicapan, and Suchitepequez. In April 2009, the Zetas gunned down five anti-narcotics police investigators in Amatitlan, supposedly in revenge for the robbery of a cocaine shipment, according to the MP. Among those implicated in the case and arrested was Baltazar Gomez Barrios, then director of the PNC. But while government functionaries indicated that Gomez had ordered the police to steal the drug shipment (see US Embassy cable "" 09GUATEMALA776 ""), a prosecutor suspected that the then director of the PNC was the one who had alerted the Zetas about the robbery, and that the Zetas then killed the police in Amatitlan. Some months after his arrest, Gomez was seen in the Tribunals Tower in the Palace of Justice (where he was assisting with a hearing for a corruption case) greeting members of the Zetas who were attending a hearing for the case of the murder of Juan Jose ""Juancho"" Leon (and ten others) in Zacapa in 2009. When two guards were taking Gomez from one floor to another, he encountered the Zetas in the lobby in front of the elevator, and he shook each of their hands before continuing on his way to the next floor. On May 14, 2011, the Zetas massacred 27 villagers with a chainsaw at a farm in La Libertad, Peten. Their motive was revenge against the property owner because he supposedly still trafficked drugs with the Gulf Cartel, according to a source in the MP. In the days before the murder, they had also killed one of the man's employees and two of his relatives. Ten days after the massacre, they kidnapped and dismembered auxiliary prosecutor Allan Stowlinsky in Coban, Alta Verapaz, after the police and the MP intercepted a Zetas cocaine shipment in Raxruha, Alta Verapaz. On September 26, last year, residents of the town of Santo Domingo Sinlaj, in Barillas, Huehuetenango (100 meters from the border with Mexico), reported that the Zetas had threatened them with death when they refused to join the organization. The MP later revealed that the Zetas had been operating in Barillas for 10 months (since before the police captured ""El Zope""). Given these events, the Zetas' presence in Quetzaltenango (where the murder of the police occurred) and in Huehuetenango (where the police found the sub-inspector's fingers) does not appear strange. The Zetas' conduct over the past five years alone is just an indication -- albeit a strong one -- that they would have been capable of gunning down eight police in the substation and torturing the sub-commissioner. There are other drug trafficking groups capable of killings like the Salcaja murders. In fact, some authorities have revealed that those detained between July 14 and 16 are linked to the Gulf Cartel. However, the attorney general Claudia Paz y Paz said the MP suspsects that those detained for the attack in Salcaja, Quetzaltenango, are also linked to the murder of seven people in San Pedro Necta, Huehuetenango, in December 2012, which the Zetas are suspected of committing. Among the victims, who were burnt to ashes, was a prosecutor from Chiquimula, Yolanda Olivares. In addition, four months before, the MP had arrested and accused three people linked to the Zetas of planning an attack against an ""official from the Chiquimula public prosecutor's office."" The investigations are still ongoing. The Only Pattern Is that There is No Pattern In terms of drug trafficking behavior, no country shows a pattern. One cannot speak of the Mexicanization of Guatemala, the way that a few years ago one could not speak of the Colombianization of Mexico. No country plagued by drug trafficking becomes an identical copy of another, because the behavior of drug trafficking depends on the interaction between the drug traffickers, the reactions of the authorities and the geographical context, more than on any predetermined pattern, says Rosada. These factors mark the differences in the behaviour of drug traffickers between one country and the next. Guatemala is not Colombia, where Plan Colombia (along with the capture of drug traffickers wanted for extradition and the destruction of coca laboratories) contributed to alleviating the war between the cartels and the sustained period of narco-violence. Later the cartels transformed into small cells that left production in the hands of the guerrillas and the paramilitaries. But neither is Guatemala Mexico, where the size of the cartels is much larger and their interaction with the authorities much more complex. Guatemala is a unique animal. But what is it? And why? What happens and what is decided in the United States and in Mexico in terms of drug trafficking resonates through Guatemala and the rest of Central America. In the past five years, a new and aggressive actor entered Guatemala: the Zetas, with their violent conquest of territory; one of the Sinaloa Cartel's allies in Guatemala fractured (the Lorenzana group); and the Gulf Cartel (Guatemala edition), ally of the weakened Mexican cartel of the same name that gave birth to the Zetas, practically disappeared. It now remains to be seen how the capture of Zetas leader Miguel Trevino Morales (alias ""Z40"") in Mexico will affect the Zetas' operation in Guatemala. The Dividing Line The engine of change in Guatemala can be divided into two. One on side are events that the United States unleashed in Mexico and Guatemala, and on the other side is the attention paid to requests made by the Public Ministry during the administrations of Amilcar Velazquez and Claudia Paz y Paz. The petitions for arrest and extradition were selectively executed by the Alvaro Colom government, when high-level leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel's allies and only medium and low-level members of the Zetas were captured. It is during the current administration, under Otto Perez Molina, that Walter Overdick, an important Zetas associate, was captured. In contract, no important Gulf Cartel allies, such as members of the Mendoza group have been captured. The capacity of the drug traffickers for violence continues, as they continue bringing in contraband arms through the blind passes of the Guatemalan border, as a Woodrow Wilson Center report lays out. One of the triggers for the reconstruction of drug trafficking in the region came from the United States in 2003, with the arrest of Osiel Cardenas Guillen, leader of the Gulf Cartel in Mexico, his extradition in 2007, and the resulting infighting within the cartel. Cardenas ran a vertical organization, a narco-dictatorship. A dictatorship is the most vulnerable structure, according to German political scientist Hannah Arendt, because it is managed by violence and not by legitimacy. Cardenas was more feared than respected. Given that he believed he was infallible, he never prepared anyone to succeed him, and he surrounded himself with a security team made up of Mexican ex-military men known as the Zetas. After Cardenas' extradition to the United States, his successors did not have the same control that Osiel had over the Zetas and they started to operate with some independence. Internal divisions resulted in the Zetas definitively separating from the Gulf Cartel in January 2010. At the same time, the Zetas had used their three years of relative independence to fortify alliances in Guatemala and open their own routes between Honduras and Mexico. The blind pass of Ingenieros, to the north of Ixcan, en Quiche, which connects with Chiapas, became one of their routes for bringing drugs up to Mexico. The location was just a few kilometers from the farm where Guatemalan authorities found a Zetas arsenal in March 2009. Walter Overdick (captured in April 2012 and extradited in December of that year along with his son, Kevin Overdick) was useful for the Zetas' efforts to establish themselves in Guatemala, and he sheltered them, from at least 2007. Some sources indicate that Overdick ""brought"" the Zetas to Guatemala, but in that time period the Zetas didn't need anyone to bring them into the country. They had already entered and left as they pleased since the mid 90s to watch over the Gulf Cartel's drug trafficking for Osiel. What they sought in 2007 was a strategic alliance that would allow them to take over the Gulf Cartel's routes in Guatemala. There were very few associates of that cartel who resisted the Zetas conquest, and who had the capacity to keep on trafficking. Overdick also permitted the Zetas to get a foothold in Peten, where he had various properties. This allowed them to harass the Mendoza family, one of the few remaining bastions of the weakening Gulf Cartel in Guatemala -- which meant the Zetas immediately considered the Mendoza their enemies. The Zetas had learned something from experience: that it was helpful to ally with family-based drug trafficking groups, which had stronger ties to communities where they had lived for generations (like the Cardenas family in Tamaulipas). Although it was on a smaller scale, Overdick (and his strong presence in Alta Verapaz) offered them this in Guatemala. Battles Postponed By 2003, when Osiel was about to fall, the Lorenzana family were trafficking drugs in Guatemala that were sent by the remains of the Cali Cartel and then passed on to the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico, according to the US Department of Justice, and were part of the transport network of Otto Herrera in Central America. But by 2008, the Lorenzanas would make a decision that would change their history for forever. By 2008, Juan Jose ""Juancho"" Leon has become a stone in the shoe. He was the partner of Marta Julia Lorenzana (also known as Yulissa or Yuli), the daughter of the family's patriarch, Waldemar Lorenzana Lima. But Juancho was also stealing drugs from other traffickers in Guatemala and Honduras, and his robberies had created enemies for the Lorenzanas. Therefore when the Zetas approached them to ask for permission to enter Zacapa and kill Leon, the Lorenzanas didn't blink and gave the go-ahead, according to Mexican and Honduran intelligence sources. The Lorenzanas weren't stupid. They knew the execution would occur with or without their consent. They knew to choose their battles, and they recognized that this was not the time for a violent war with the Zetas. It was a matter of honor among criminals. If the Zetas killed without permission on Lorenzana territory, they would have to respond. They didn't have the luxury of not reacting, which would make them seem like an easy target for others aspiring to dominate drug trafficking in the zone. They knew they should wait, take their time, and then decide if they would make a strategic alliance with the Zetas, or if they would begin a war against them like the conflict seen in Mexico. Juancho had stolen a Zetas shipment in Honduras, and he had killed two of their men, according to the same Mexican and Honduran intelligence sources. On March 25, 2008, the Zetas responded. They killed Juancho in a clash that left another ten dead (including Juanco's bodyguards and some Mexican Zetas). It was not simple revenge. The Zetas showed what would happen if anyone killed or robbed any of them (which is what might have happened with the Salcaja case). It was a lesson that the historian Thucydides proclaimed in ancient Greece: the emperor, or whoever aspired to be emperor, should always respond to attacks to show that he is not an easy target. In this way, the Zetas raised their profile in Guatemala and also took the pulse of other rival groups. On November 30, 2008 they interrupted a horse race organized by allies of the Sinaloa Cartel in the town of Agua Zarca, in Huehuetenango. The shootout left 17 dead, including people from both groups. This would be the signature of the Zetas in the following years, and they would become one of the principal factors behind the instability in drug trafficking in Guatemala -- more even than the police. Capture of the Lorenzanas Guatemalan authorities, including the MP and the Ministry of the Interior, and the United States with their orders of capture and extradition, dealt the Lorenzanas a serious blow. In the list of people eligible for extradition to the United States, there were people from all the criminal groups. But in Guatemala, operations concentrated on allies of the Sinaloa Cartel. An ex-official with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Michael Braun, said that in Colombia the strategy was to attack one cartel at a time, and maybe that was the strategy also used in Guatemala. Regardless, whatever the intention was, the results ended up favoring the Zetas. By 2001, the government of Alvaro Colom boasted of having captured at least a hundred Zetas, although two-thirds were Guatemalan (many, replaceable), and the majority were mid and low-level members. A third were Mexican, but no one important, according to DEA reports -- not even Daniel Perez Rojas, alias ""Cachetes,"" who was detained in April 2009 for the murder of Juancho and the Zacapa massacre. Cachetes was a mid-level commander, in contrast with ""Z40"" Trevino Morales, who at that time was the Zetas' second-in-command in Mexico (and the first from 2013 until last July 15, when authorities captured him in Mexico ). In addition, according to a source from the 2010 government, ""Z40"" frequently went to Guatemala during those years. There are multiple accusations and arrest warrants against Trevino in the United States for drug trafficking and various murders committed in Texas that date back to those times. The decline of the Lorenzanas had begun in 2009, when the Attorney General's Office in Washington, DC, presented a new accusation against them, and the DEA tried -- in vain -- to capture family members on three separate occasions. Between 2010 and 2011, the Interior Ministry signaled in an interview with a Spanish media outlet that the army was the source of leaks that alerted traffickers. But the police in Zacapa were also untrustworthy, according to a police investigator who worked the case. Between the US pressure and the Guatemalan authorities' decision, large operations to capture the Lorenzanas were finally mounted. In the following two years, the Lorenzanas' umbrella, which had covered trafficking in the eastern part of the country, would start to spring leaks. The groups that had worked below them now had space to become independent, as the Zetas had done after Osiel's arrest, when they were still part of the Gulf Cartel. With the Lorenzanas busy trying to keep a low profile without neglecting their business, the mid-level commanders and junior narcos assumed they had the green light to try and improve their positions. Between 2010 and 2011, the arrest warrants and extradition orders from the United States and the arrests made in Guatemala by the MP and the PNC started molding drug trafficking in Guatemala like plasticine. This time, the Sinaloa Cartel's allies in Guatemala bore the worst of it, in particular five bosses: Mauro Salomon Ramirez, captured on October 2, 2010; Juan Ortiz alias ""Chamale,"" captured on March 30, 2011; Waldemar Lorenzana Lima (the Lorenzana's top leader) captured on April 26, 2011; Byron Gilberto Linares Cordon, captured on June 18, 2011; and Elio Lorenzana Cordon (Lorenzana Lima's son), captured on November 8, 2011. In theory, these arrests should have taken down the whole structure. In practice, it did not. What factor saved it? The Sinaloa Cartel has a horizontal structure; that is to say, that the loss of one head doesn't paralyze the whole structure, according to the DEA's former director of international operations, Michael Vigil. This is despite the ascendance of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman as the leader of the cartel. Another factor is corruption. Sources in the PNC say that Chamale directed all his drug trafficking operations from prison, which is an example of when interaction between drug traffickers and certain authorities favors the trafficker. At the same time, permitting Chamale to extend his arms out of the prison may have been why the west of the country avoided the type of narcoviolence that usually accompanies a power dispute (given the power vacuum left by Chamale) -- something that the groups in the east couldn't say after the capture of the Lorenzanas. The groups in the west (led by Chamale) continued to operate, perhaps even with a higher level of influencee due to their geographic proximity to their Mexican counterparts. At the same time, the Lorenzanas were exposed to other factors, the biggest of which was the Zetas. Alliances and the Conquest of Routes In 2011, the arrests of the Lorenzanas cleared the path for the Zetas to force an alliance. The Zetas could take advantage of the Lorenzanas' loyalties in the zone to co-opt the vacant leadership and maintain the monopoly on transit via Zacapa. Thus the moment arrived for the Lorenzanas to make the decision they had put off since 2008, when they gave the Zetas permission to kill Juancho. The fact that overland cocaine trafficking from Honduras to Guatemala increased in 2009 certainly didn't help the Lorenzanas, because an increase in military patrols in Peten decreased the number of drug flights that could land in Guatemala. In addition, the coup in Honduras in June 2009 facilitated an increase in aerial drug trafficking to the country because the security forces were more focused on controlling political violence (and Honduras' congress refused to approve an extradition law, which finally passed in 2012). With more drugs moving overland, there were more routes to fight over and more violence on both sies of the border. It is not that there was more drug production for the narcos, but rather a greater volume of drugs was passing across the Honduras-Guatemala border that previously would have been transported by air from South America to Guatemala, meaning there were more drugs being transported overland that were vulnerable to robberies. The arrests and the extraditions, in Guatemala and Mexico, and the expansion of the Zetas (allied with local drug trafficking groups) started to change the face of drug trafficking in the country. In 2007, they entered through Huehuetenango, but they made Alta Verapaz their base of operations. By 2009, they had dominated the corridor between Honduras and Mexico, starting with Izabal, following the Franja Transversal del Norte, passing through Alta Verapaz -- its bridge to Quiche -, but they also moved toward Peten in the north, and toward the capital and the Pacific coast to the south, according to the MP. In 2009 it was clear that the Zetas had found the path and access to arms in military storehouses. In March and April, the authorities found numerous weapons, thousands of bullets, and at least a thousand grenades in Ixcan, Quiche, and Amatitlan. In Amatitlan, the authorities found a rifle that belonged to a set purchased for the police during the government of Oscar Berger (2004-2008), said Carlos Menocal, who was the Ministry of the Interior for President Colom (2008-2012) from 2010 onwards. Between 2010 and 2011, the Zetas fortified their extension towards the eastern part of the country with the same aggression they had employed in Mexico. The expansion occurred after the arrests -- when the Lorenzanas were at their weakest and were keeping a low profile. They continued trafficking, but by now they did not have the power to maintain a monopoly over what went on in Zacapa. Their control over drug robbers on the border with Honduras and, to the south, with El Salvador, was further weakened. So the Zetas seized the moment. The increase in the number of violent deaths in the provinces near the border with Honduras since 2011 could coincide with when the Zetas started charging the ""tax"" on routes they controlled. In Mexico, their modus operandi consisted of taking territory and then monopolizing criminal activity in the area. That is to say, they take control of a zone not just to engage in criminal activity, but also so that they can charge a tax on anyone who wants to pass through or engage in criminal activity in their territory -- a kind of criminal tax. Thus they have agreements with migrant smugglers and human traffickers, among other criminal groups. The killings included attacks against some landowners in the eastern part of the country (who the police linked to drug trafficking), some small-time drug dealers, and shipment thieves in the area. Among these cases, one that stands out is that of Jairo Orellana, who, according to civilian intelligence sources, the Zetas tried to execute for failing to pay the tax. The Zetas gunmen killed his seven bodyguards in front of a clinic building in Zone 15 of Guatemala City in an attack in November 2012 from which Orellana is beleived to have escaped unharmed. Orellana has also been identified as Marta Julia Lorenzana's partner. By 2012, the Zetas were already operating in the southern and western parts of Guatemala. By last December, they had received two shipments on a farm in Escuintla. The person who sent them from Zacapa is believed to be Marta Julia Lorenzana, according to unofficial information. This marked a dividing line in the history of the family, who for years had trafficked exclusively for the Sinaloa Cartel. For the Zetas, in contrast, the incursion into the southern coast was not unusual. Some of the Mexican Zetas detained in 2008 had identification documents that marked them as residents of municipalities along the southern coast, according to the MP (who investigated whether the documents were forged or whether they had been legally issued based on false identities). It is believed that once they were in Escuintla in 2012, the Zetas used another transporter to move the shipments to Mexico. It is striking that Hans Breiner Lemus Lorenzana, ex-student of the Adolfo V. Hall Institute and 17-year-old son of Marta Julia Lorenzana, was detained last June in San Marcos with a shipment destined for the Sinaloa Cartel when a military source says his mother has been linked to the Zetas since December 2012 ( although the US Treasury Department only links her to the Sinaloa Cartel ). Guatemalan authorities determined that the 15 kilos of cocaine that were seized from Lemus Lorenzana were marked with a horseshoe, a characteristic symbol of the Sinaloa Cartel. The fact that it was a small shipment could indicate that it was meant as a demonstration, to prove the efficiency of a new route or sender before risking a larger shipment -- a test that that the adolescent evidently failed, either through inexperience or because somebody informed on him. One former government official suspects that the the fracturing of the power of the Lorenzanas left some members and allies of the family free to negotiate with people unrelated to the Sinaloa Cartel. From there, perhaps, Lemus Lorenzanas' mother became linked to the Zetas. This is one of the open spaces underneath the Lorenzanas' leaky umbrella, which now sets the stage for new conflicts. Although it is true that drug traffickers' territories are not set in stone, as Rosada says, they do at least have defined, untouchable routes, and the more people who get close to one group's routes, the greater the potential for conflict -- especially with the Zetas supposedly making their incursion into Escuintla, where the Sinaloa Cartel has traditionally controlled the routes. If some members of the Lorenzana family are trafficking with one group, and other members trafficking with another, the potential for conflict is even higher. The current danger is that the Zetas appear to have formed an operational ring that extends one arm from the border with Honduras up to the northwest and the Gulf of Mexico (the group's stronghold), and another that extends from the east down to the southern cost. If this is indeed the case, friction and an increase in violence in the western part of the country is only a matter of time. There is little to indicate that the associates of the Sinaloa Cartel, which traditionally owns the Pacific route, will take the Zetas' expansion lying down. However, the recent capture of ""Z40"" in Mexico could change the course of events. His brother, Oscar Omar Trevino Morales (alias ""Z42""), is the principal candidate to assume leadership of the group, but only time will tell if he is capable of keeping the Zetas from weakening and fracturing in Guatemala. Until then, drug trafficking will remain subject to the hands that will write -- both within and outside the law -- its next chapter. *This article originally appeared in Plaza Publica.

"El Salvador Gangs Release Joint Statement Promoting Truce. Leaders of El Salvador's street gangs have issued a joint statement declaring their desire to keep moving forward with the country's gang truce even as homicides continue to rise in the country for the fourth consecutive month. Following a visit by the Organization of American States (OAS) to review the state of El Salvador's gang truce, several of the country's gangs -- including the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and the Barrio 18 -- released a statement announcing their ""unbreakable"" desire to continue the ""peace process."" The gangs also stated that a twelfth ""peace zone"" would be inaugurated soon and that they would consider turning over more arms in coming months. At the same time, the gangs ""rejected"" actions taken by the authorities in the country's prisons saying they were intended to ""damage the peace process."" The gang leaders announced they would vote in the upcoming February 2014 elections, calling on their fellow gang members to do the same. The statement ended by saying perceptions the truce is failing are ""false"" and promising facilitators of the process and international supporters that ""we will not let you down."" Meanwhile, September saw 54 more murders compared with the same period in 2012, an upward trend that has now continued since June. Police have blamed the spike in murders on gang members failing to respect the truce. Although El Salvador's murder rate continues to be significantly lower than before the agreement between the gangs was reached in March 2012, there have been signs, such as the rising murder rate and recent violence in the ""peace zones, "" that the truce is reaching a breaking point. Additionally, support for the truce has been wavering both among political leaders, who have been wary of backing the agreement ahead of coming elections , and the public, who according to a recent survey believe the truce most benefits the gangs. With the future of the truce in jeopardy, the gang's statement could be taken as a desire to reassure the doubters by reasserting their commitment to the process at a sensitive moment. However, it could also be related to recent controversies over changes in the prisons where many leaders are incarcerated, which government critics said were attempts to undermine the truce. Improvements in the conditions of imprisoned gang leaders are widely considered to have been a key incentive used to bring leaders to the negotiating table, and any attempts to back away from that approach were always likely to provoke a response from the gangs."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"FARC Concentration Zones May Help Prevent Recycled Violence. The recently announced concentration zones where FARC guerrillas will gather upon the signing of a peace agreement with Colombia's government provide the two sides an opportunity to prevent the continuation of violence and illegal activity in these areas. The 23 concentration zones, as agreed to by the FARC and the Colombian government last week with the signing of a bilateral ceasefire , are located in 12 departments across Colombia. In addition to the concentration zones, which are officially known as ""Transitory Hamlet Zones for Normalization,"" there will be eight FARC encampments. Four of the concentration zones will be located in the department of Meta, while three will be in the departments of Antioquia and Caqueta. The other departments that will host concentration zones are: Cesar, Norte de Santander, Tolima, Cauca, Narino, Putumayo, Arauca, Vichada and Guaviare. (See map below) Meta will also hold two of the FARC camps, which are smaller in size than the concentration zones. According to a June 24 press release from the Defense Ministry, the zones were selected because they are in rural areas, are sufficiently ""distant"" from any border, and are not located where coca crops or illegal mining is present, among other criteria. Each zone will be encircled by a 1-kilometer buffer area, which neither guerrillas nor security forces will be allowed to enter. The FARC will only move into the concentration zones once a final peace agreement is signed. Rebel fighters will spend up to 180 days in the zones, during which time the guerrillas will hand in their weapons to a United Nations verification mission and receive training on transitioning to civilian life. The majority of the concentration zones are located in municipalities that InSight Crime has identified as being at high risk of a recycling of criminal violence and economies in the aftermath of a peace agreement between the government and the FARC. In addition to the FARC, other criminal actors like rebel group the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) and neo-paramilitary organization the Urabenos are present in many of the zones. These groups could grab control of the FARC's illicit economies, such as taxes on coca growing, in the event of a guerrilla demobilization. For example, one of the concentration zones will be in Tibu, which is situated in the region of Catatumbo, the last stronghold of the Popular Liberation Army (Ejercito Popular de Liberacion - EPL) and one of the most profitable cocaine producing areas of the world. Numerous other armed groups have a presence in Catatumbo as well, all of which would be interested in taking over the FARC's illicit revenue streams. There are signs that the wheels are already in motion for such a process. In recent months there have been reports of clashes between the FARC, ELN and Urabenos in several parts of the country, including Narino, Antioquia and Choco. The clashes have caused the displacement of hundreds of locals. The establishment of the concentration zones, however, could lessen the possibility that such a violent realignment takes place, at least in and around where the zones are located. Security forces will have a significant presence in these areas, many of which have been neglected by the state for decades. By working with the FARC, the government may be able to help link these communities to the wider Colombian society and prevent the transfer of criminal economies to other illegal armed groups. In so doing, the Colombian government will be attempting to avoid a repeat of history. The state's failure to take control of territory following the demobilization of the right-wing paramilitary organization United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC) in 2006 enabled the rise of criminal groups known as BACRIM (from the Spanish, ""bandas criminales""). These groups currently represent one of the biggest security threats in Colombia. In any event, the concentration zones only cover a fraction of the communities that are at high risk of continued violence and illegal activity in the event of a peace agreement; InSight Crime has identified almost 80 such municipalities across the country as part of field research conducted over the past year. The state will need to bolster its presence in these areas as well, but it's unlikely they will receive the same amount of attention as the concentration zones. If the state remains absent, these high-risk areas not located near concentration zones may well turn into the key battlegrounds for control of the FARC's criminal economies once a peace deal is signed."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Narcos, Police Unite in Adoration of Warrior Saint in Brazil. A growing number of Rio de Janiero's faithful -- ranging from drug traffickers to police officers -- are reportedly praying to a ""warrior saint"" for protection, a possible response to the difficulties authorities have faced in reigning in the city's violence. Saint George, also known as the warrior saint, has a growing following in Rio de Janiero, where criminals and law enforcement officials alike pray to him to keep them safe from danger, reported BBC Mundo. ""Here in Brazil, we are experiencing high levels of violence. Those devoted to Saint George seeks protection from evil spirits, assaults, and murders,"" a local priest told BBC Mundo. Saint George is typically depicted on horseback and clad in medieval armour, and is celebrated by various Christian Churches on April 23. That day is an official holiday in Rio de Janeiro, with masses and processions taking place across the state. Saint George's popularity in Rio is arguably tied to lack of confidence that the government will keep citizens safe from crime. ""Now that we can't have faith in the politicians, we need faith in someone,"" one believer told the BBC. There is reason for such pessimism. Following the installation of Rio's police pacification units (UPP) in 2008, violence in the city has dropped significantly. However, gangs have reportedly regained influence in some of the territories they lost due to the pacification program, and murder rates in at least one Rio favela climbed considerably last year. Recent police violence against innocents in Rio -- including the killing of a 10-year old boy -- has led to massive protests in the city over how authorities are combating insecurity. SEE ALSO : Brazil News and Profiles Meanwhile, the high number of police officers killed in Rio from confrontations with gangs means that law enforcement is also likely looking for divine protection. Saint George's dual patronage of police officers and drug traffickers is not unique to Rio. This phenomenon ""mirrors Santa Muerte's role in Mexico and parts of Central America as patroness of both narcos and law enforcement,"" Andrew Chesnut, a professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University and author of the book ""Devoted to Death: Santa Muerte, the Skeleton Saint,"" told InSight Crime."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"More Military Spending in Central America Giving Rise to Old and New Fears. Several Central American nations are increasing their defense budgets after decades of demilitarization, citing the need to combat organized crime. But there are some who see inherent dangers in assigning the military a bigger role, and others who see geopolitical forces at work. The Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador are at the center of these increases in military expenditures. According to the Security and Defense Network of Latin America ( RESDAL ), quoted in the BBC , in El Salvador, defense spending per year has jumped from $106 million to $133 million over the last five years; Honduras is up from $63 million to $172 million over the same period; and Guatemala's spending has gone from $134 million to $160 million. The BBC also says Panama and Costa Rica have upped spending on security forces. Most of these countries are focused on the need to increase aerial capabilities. The Honduran government announced in June plans to purchase helicopters and aircraft from the U.S., as well Super Tucano aircraft from Brazil, using money from a "" security tax "" levied on businesses. This is the first step in a large-scale plan aimed at improving the potency of the Honduran Armed Forces, which will also include the purchase of sophisticated radar equipment. The new equipment will be used to intercept drug trafficking operations, according to the Honduran government. Meanwhile, Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom formally announced in July the abolition of a limit on military expenditure , which had until then had been capped at 0.33 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), as set out in a 1996 peace agreement between the government and leftist guerrillas. With increased funds at its disposal for defense spending, the Guatemalan government announced in late September that it too planned to purchase a number of Brazilian Super Tucano aircraft, radars and air traffic control equipment, at a cost of $166 million, according to the BBC. Echoing the words of the Salvadoran and Honduran governments, a spokesperson of the Guatemalan Defense Ministry said improvements in military equipment will ""improve the tracking of routes used by drug traffickers."" Salvadoran President, Mauricio Funes, also announced plans to purchase up to 10 Super Tucano aircraft in late 2010. Although the plan was postponed due to lack of funds in February, the government intends to press ahead with its plans when funds become available. Over the past twenty years, Central America has become a crucial drug trafficking corridor and in recent years evidence has emerged that drug cartels, notably the Mexican Zetas and Sinaloa Cartel , are establishing bases in Central America. The results have been catestrophic. The Northern Triangle has some of the highest homicide rates in the world, the United Nations said in a 2011 report. The government's inability to control this violence has led many to pull the military back into the fray of controlling ""internal order,"" assigning some of them to city streets and prisons. But the trend is troubling for a number of reasons. Central American armies have long histories of overturning governments and abusing its citizens. In just the most recent case in 2009, the Honduran military removed democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya. What's more, the military does not have the training and the government does not have the required oversight in order to ensure abuses will be investigated and prosecuted. Some have said the emphasis on beefing up militaries is misplaced, or, what Luis Cordero, director of the Arias Foundation for Peace, has called "" irrational ."" Organized crime, according to Cordero, should be fought with a well trained civilian police force given adequate resources and not through increasing military power. Other critics say increased military spending is less about crime and more about geopolitics. At the heart of this geopolitical struggle is Nicaragua, a staunch ally of Venezuela, who is a staunch enemy of the United States. Nicaragua has also announced plans to acquire more aircraft and helicopters to fight drug trafficking. ""The central issue is not effectiveness in fighting organized crime, rather a U.S. influenced attempt to provide a 'geopolitical counterweight' to the influence of Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia,"" said Honduran scholar Eugenio Sosa in an interview with Mexico's El Universal newspaper in a reference to the increased spending in his country. The fear has some talking about a regional arms race. Across Latin America, governments have increased military spending by an average 5.2 percent, an Al Jazeera report says. Global military expenditures, meanwhile, increased by only 1.3 percent in 2010, according to an April 2011 report released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).

"U.S. Special Forces Trained Mexican Troops in Colorado. In a sign of the increasing level of security cooperation between the two countries, an elite United States military unit known as the Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) is training Mexican soldiers in counternarcotics operations. According to a Pentagon source cited by El Universal , the AWG held a joint training exercise in Colorado last April with elements of the Mexican Armed Forces. Though the exact nature of the exercise is classified, the paper reports that the location was chosen in order to simulate the rugged terrain often favored by drug traffickers. The U.S. army has trained with Mexican armed forces on several other occasions, but according to an anonymous Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official, the AWG is especially suited for Mexico's drug violence. ""Asymmetrical war involves two groups with a significant difference in power whether it be in terms of weapons, tactics, or number, and that we observe in the case of the Mexican cartels and the Mexican Army; so this type of training is useful not just in military terms, but also in terms of intelligence to locate weaknesses and combat them, "" the official told El Universal. This revelation comes days after a New York Times investigation said that the U.S. government is sending intelligence operatives and retired military personnel to Mexico to assist in counternarcotics operations in the country for the first time. As InSight Crime has noted, the security relationship between the U.S. and Mexico has reached a new level, due to the $1.4 billion dollar Merida Initiative. Still, seeing as the death toll in the country continues to rise , it is unclear whether the partnership has brought about significant improvements on the ground. "	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Are Armed Drones the Weapon of the Future for Mexicos Cartels?Mexico's powerful drug cartels could be using armed drones to attack those impeding their criminal operations, marking the potential expansion of the use of this technology from just transporting drugs or carrying out surveillance. In July of this year, an armed drone was used to attack the house of Baja California state Public Safety Secretary Gerardo Sosa Olachea in the city of Tecate along the US-Mexico border, Zeta magazine reported. At least two drones were allegedly used in the strike. The first was armed with audio and video equipment and two improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that did not explode after falling into the official's yard. A second drone was seen above the house likely performing surveillance, according to Zeta. The July incident was the first time that a Mexican cartel used a weaponized drone to carry out such an attack, according to Mike Vigil, the former Chief of International Operations at the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). However, the ""inoperability"" of the IEDs suggests that the attack was more likely a method to intimidate the official rather than to carry out an actual attack, according to Small Wars Journal. Sosa Olachea told Zeta that he thought the threat likely came from one of the drug cartels operating in the area that officials have dealt serious blows against through seizing drug shipments and dismantling drug laboratories. The Tijuana Cartel, Sinaloa Cartel and Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion - CJNG) are all known to be operating in this specific area along the US-Mexico border. Towards the end of 2017, the Daily Beast reported on the first apparent incident in which an armed drone intended for use in a violent attack was discovered in the arsenal of a Mexican cartel. Drones are gaining popularity throughout Latin America among criminal groups and law enforcement officials for their ability to traffic drugs and carry out surveillance. But their use, or intended use, by organized crime to execute violent attacks is a recent development. A DEA source explained that since 2014, Mexico's cartels have hired local workers to construct custom-made narco drones to traffic cocaine and other drugs across the US-Mexico border. Mexico's security forces have also relied on drones that transmit images and videos in real-time in order to identify key locations used by the cartels to store drugs and weapons or to carry out other criminal activities. US authorities have also utilized drones in Mexico to aid in the so-called ""war on drugs"" against the country's criminal groups. But the latest evidence suggests that drones might be the ""way of the future"" for Mexico's cartels for engaging in ""cartel warfare,"" according to Vigil. As Mexico's criminal world continues to fragment, Vigil told InSight Crime that these groups may start to use drones as an ""offensive weapon simply because it will not require the loss of human personnel, which is difficult to replace especially if they are trained and have a full understanding of the cartel's operations."""	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Captures ""Czar"" of Thriving Synthetic Drug Trade. Police in Colombia have captured the country's ""czar"" of synthetic drugs, highlighting the growing demand for party drugs among Colombia's wealthy and the opportunism of organized criminal groups feeding the local market. Police say Hector Alonso Castro Franco, alias ""Hector Largo,"" a leading figure in the criminal groups the Machos and the Urabenos, has been arrested in the western city of Pereira, reported El Pais. Investigators identified Castro as the main distributor of synthetic drugs in Colombia and the principal producer of 2CB, or ""pink cocaine,"" a hallucinogenic designer drug sold in major cities such as Bogota, Cali, Medellin, Cartagena, and Barranquilla. El Espectador reported Castro had taken over the business after the capture of Hector Mario Urdinola, alias ""Chicho."" Castro is also wanted for multiple homicides in Valle de Cauca, where his operation was based, reported El Tiempo. According to police, the drugs were processed in clandestine labs in the southwestern city of Cali -- the capital of Valle de Cauca -- and the central Coffee Region. In several cases, police identified traces of veterinary drugs, which they said increase the psychoactive effect of the pills but also make them more dangerous. According to media reports, the Machos took over 2CB production by kidnapping a criminally entrepreneurial chemist who had set up his own operation and forcing him to reveal his formula. Castro inherited the mantle of running the Machos' synthetic drugs business after the January 2013 capture of Chicho , though the operation can now be considered part of the criminal franchise of the Urabenos, which have essentially absorbed the Machos since Chicho exchanged access to drug trafficking routes for arms, financing and manpower in 2011. The synthetic drugs market is highly lucrative and growing, with Colombia police saying in 2013 that such substances, particularly 2CB, were replacing cocaine. It's a trend that has been seen in other countries throughout the region, though one largely limited to upper and middle class users , with a single gram of 2CB fetching between $60 and $75 in Colombia."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Police Chief Interview Reveals US Dilemma. A revealing interview with Honduras' police chief has illustrated the bind the United States finds itself in when fighting the drug trade in collaboration with Latin American governments and institutions, where corruption is endemic. Juan Carlos ""El Tigre"" Bonilla, who is accused of running death squads ten years ago, today runs a force accused of similar crimes , and is so feared within Honduras that ""few dare speak his name above a whisper,"" reports the Associated Press. However, in an eight-hour interview with the AP , Bonilla spoke repeatedly of his close relationship with the US diplomats working in the country. The US government is his ""best ally and support,"" he said. The notion that US aid money only went to Honduran police units not under Bonilla's direct command, as claimed by US Assistant Secretary of State William Brownfield last March, was dismissed by the police chief, who said there were no units beyond his supervision. Off the record, a US aide to Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy, who led efforts to attach human rights conditions to US aid, said diplomats had to talk to a lot of people they did not like: ""As far as his saying the US is his biggest ally in counter drug operations, our ally is Honduras, not the chief of police."" Perhaps most revealing in the AP piece is a comment from Arabeska Sanchez, founder of Honduras' University Institute for Peace and Security who taught a younger Bonilla as a professor at the National Police Academy. When Honduran authorities were deciding who to appoint as police chief in 2012, Bonilla ""was the only top police commander without known links to organized crime,"" said Sanchez. Indeed, the two police chiefs who predated him were both fired after being accused of overseeing murder within seven months of each other. Crime and corruption are rife within the force and attempts at reform have floundered. This is to be expected in a country where institutions are notoriously weak and the profits available from the drug trade so high. The reality is that if the United States wants to conduct and assist counternarcotics efforts in Latin America it has no option but to work with at best partially compromised security institutions. It is, as the Bonilla case illustrates, often a choice among the least worst option."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Is Ecuadors Pablo Escobar a Member of Colombias FARC?A jailed Ecuadorean drug capo is claiming to be a member of Colombia's demobilized FARC guerrilla group in order to receive judicial benefits offered to former fighters under a 2016 peace agreement. But simply appearing on the FARC's membership list may not be enough to prove association with the group, raising questions about how to verify who should be allowed to take advantage of the peace process, and who should not. Washington Prado Alava, who was dubbed the ""Pablo Escobar"" of Ecuador after his arrest in Colombia earlier this year, is attempting to block his extradition to the United States in Colombia's Supreme Court by claiming he is a member of the demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), El Tiempo reported on September 16. The peace deal signed with the FARC last year promised members of the group they would not be extradited. Prado's claim to FARC membership is reportedly based on a letter confirming him as such, which was signed by Gustavo Gonzalez, alias ""Rambo,"" the former head of the FARC's Daniel Aldana Mobile Column. Prado's lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to call on Gonzalez to confirm the claims. Prado stands accused of heading the most powerful criminal organization on the Colombian and Ecuadorean Pacific Coast. Unknown to the public until his arrest, Prado allegedly shipped 250 metric tons of cocaine to the US Pacific Coast, according to US and Colombian authorities. His purchase of coca from the Daniel Aldana Mobile Column was reportedly documented, but official intelligence did not show Prado as a FARC member. Prado's case points to the FARC's complex ties with the drug trade, which at times can blur the lines between a guerrilla fighter and a trafficker. Indeed, it is interesting that Prado's membership claims are linked to the Daniel Aldana Mobile Column, formerly one of the FARC's most powerful structures. SEE ALSO : Colombia News and Profiles The Prado case also shows the difficult position in which the FARC have found themselves with respect to the peace agreement. As pointed out by El Tiempo, declaring the Ecuadorean capo as a member of the guerrilla group would mean taking responsibility for the 250 metric tons of cocaine he allegedly shipped, a problematic admission of guilt for an organization that maintains its involvement in the drug trade stayed inside Colombian borders. Denying Prado's claim, on the other hand, will no doubt fuel suspicion that mid-ranking FARC members were involved in wrongfully slipping traffickers into FARC membership lists so that they could improperly take advantage of the provisions of the peace deal. The FARC have previously stated that the group's membership lists will be vetted intensively, arguing that the two dozen other cases like Prado's will be resolved. However, the group has not publicly commented on Prado's case specifically, suggesting that the organization may be debating internally about the best way to handle it."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Is a FARC Dissident War Looming in Colombias Naya Region?The disappearance and murder of four people and a number of cases of mass forced displacement and confinement, have drawn the government's attention to the neglected Naya region, located between the Colombian departments of Cauca and Valle del Cauca. A dissident group from the 30th Front of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) claimed responsibility for the deaths, and an impending conflict is feared between this group and another moving into the area. After several weeks of uncertainty, on June 3, the name of the group wreaking havoc on the Naya region was made public: United Force of the Pacific (Fuerza Unida del Pacifico). A two-minute video was released featuring a black man dressed in camouflage with insignia reminiscent of the FARC and his face covered by a balaclava. Accompanied by three men armed with rifles, he read a brief statement in which the group took responsibility for the ""retention"" and ""execution"" of brothers Hermen, Obdulio and Iber Angulo Zamora, as well as Simeon Zamora. *This article was originally published by Verdad Abierta and was translated, edited and reprinted by InSight Crime with permission. See the Spanish original here. The events date back to April 17, when a man known in the area as alias ""Cachetes"" contracted the services of Hermen, a fiberglass boat builder, to pick up a delivery in the town of Taparal on the Micay River. Before departing, Hermen's brother Obdulio, an area teacher, offered to go along. Cachetes also sent Simeon with them. It was assumed it would be a simple one-day, round trip. However, the men's whereabouts were unknown after they left the village of Juan Santo, until last Sunday. Their disappearance led Iber -- an active community leader who promoted the substitution of coca crops and was a member of the National Coordinator of Coca, Poppy and Marijuana Farmers (Coordinadora Nacional de Cultivadores de Coca, Amapola y Marihuana - COCCAM) -- to inquire after them and contact the leaders of the FARC dissident group. The leaders of that group are alleged to be two men, one of whom goes by the aliases ""Jair"" and ""El Loco,"" and the other by the alias ""Chumbi."" In response to the inquiries, on May 2, Jair arrived in Juan Santo with 15 armed men and began desperately searching for Iber, looting several homes. But they did not find him. The community leader had already escaped out of the back of his house. He then spent three days in the jungle before an Ombudsman's Office humanitarian mission set out from Buenaventura and picked him up in a boat provided by Colombia's National Learning Service (Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje - SENA). After navigating for several minutes, Iber's worst fears were confirmed: Hermen, Obdulio and Simeon were being held at one of the dissident group's checkpoints. According to a statement released by the Ombudsman's Office, ""At 2:28 p.m. a call was received from the mission announcing that the boat had been intercepted on the Naya River at the village of Santa Maria by another boat with people armed with long range weapons who aggressively proceeded to seize the mission sent for Iber Angulo Zamora."" The press release also stated that ""when the officials from the Ombudsman's Office stopped to request an explanation and respect for the humanitarian mission, the weapons were pointed threateningly at them in grave violation of the principles of international humanitarian law."" Sources that have worked in the region consulted by Verdad Abierta still have no explanation for why this attack on the humanitarian mission occurred in an area where the navy has presence. ""A security council meeting was held the night before in Buenaventura, and the authorities knew that the commission was going to go in the next day. The question is, 'Why didn't they protect it?'"" a source said. From the moment he was captured, Iber was added to the list of people held by the dissident members of the FARC that had formed in the Naya region after the FARC laid down their weapons. At the time, authorities had no information about the group. The silence was broken, however, when the United Force of the Pacific claimed responsibility for the ""execution"" of the four men. But their ""justification"" produced a great deal of outrage throughout the Naya because the dissidents claimed the four men were criminals with links to paramilitary groups, and even questioned the work of the national and local ombudsman's offices and international organizations because they recognized the detained men as human rights leaders. Allegations that the four men were criminals with ties to paramilitary groups caused pain and indignation among the people of the area. One person with detailed knowledge of the situation in the region told Verdad Abierta that the statements are false because the four abducted men worked with their communities, and no one in the region would have ties with paramilitary groups. One reason it is unlikely they would be part of such illegal structures stems from a past event: During Holy Week in 2001 the Calima Bloc of the paramilitary group United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC) committed one of the worst massacres in the history of the armed conflict and caused a dramatic massive displacement. Trapped Between Dissidents The same source also said that the justification given by the United Force of the Pacific regarding alleged links to paramilitary groups could be an effort to stave off a confrontation by sending a message to another FARC dissident group moving into the territory from the upper Naya region. In mid-May, a group calling itself the Jaime Martines Mobile Column began to circulate a pamphlet in which it introduced itself as a political-military group that was not involved in either drug trafficking or common crime, in contrast to other groups acting under the guise of the guerrilla cause. In the five points made in the pamphlet, the group distances itself from those who call themselves ""the defenders of the Pacific"" and points out that they are causing deaths and disappearances such as those of the Angulo brothers. For that reason, the group announced , ""our organization will combat that group because they have not accepted the ideological political-military guidelines and have only caused great discredit to the FARC."" It is being said throughout the region there was a confrontation two weeks ago in the village of El Saltillo between Jair's men and a dissident group that has been encroaching on the area from the upper Naya. Versions of the event vary but consistently indicate that men from the United Force of the Pacific died. Some say two perished, others four and still others that up to eight died in the fighting. According to fieldwork carried out by the Ideas for Peace Foundation (Fundacion Ideas Para la Paz - FIP), which on 15 April published a detailed investigation on the state of the FARC dissidents, since October rumours were heard regarding how the 30th Front had settled in the town of Jamundi, Valle del Cauca department and was expected to expand to the valley towns of Suarez and Buenos Aires. The move could be further confirmed through a confrontation that occurred between FARC dissidents in the jurisdiction of an indigenous reservation that left several casualties in its wake and caused the displacement of dozens of native Colombians. Meanwhile, Valle de Cauca department's Secretary of Peace and Reconciliation Fabio Cardozo, who was in the region as part of an interinstitutional commission to learn about the situation first-hand and assist the displaced, told Verdad Abierta that he does not know about the version of events involving a second dissident group and possible confrontations in the upper Naya region because the mission only reached the middle Naya. He clarified, however, that the area could be reached from Jamundi on mules or along the riverbank, adding, ""It's a wild and distant place. It's where a good part of illicit farming is concentrated."" The Inter-Ecclesial Commission on Justice and Peace (Comision Intereclesial de Justicia y Paz), which assists communities near the Pacific coast, has also commented on the situation. In a May 22 press release, it stated that the previous day ""in the morning residents in the area of the village of La Concepcion heard shots fired estimated to have come from El Saltillo, on the road leading from the lower Naya to the upper Naya."" The statement continued, ""the existing militarization from the mouth of the river to San Francisco, criminal group operations in the lower area -- to which the alleged disappearance of the Angulo brothers and Simeon are attributed -- and the FARC dissident groups that could be controlling the upper Naya region, are putting the population at high risk. The Community Council reopened two refuge spaces in San Francisco and La Concepcion."" If the region's rumors are verified, the situation could worsen because the 64 communities in the Naya region could become trapped in a violent and bloody dispute for control of the area's illicit economies. Sources knowledgeable of the regional dynamics indicate that Jair's group, which is concentrated in one of the areas where the FARC laid down their arms, is made up of 30 men, has informants on its payroll in almost every town in the region and charges those transporting drugs to the Pacific coast a ""tax."" In the wake of the four disappearances finally recognized by the United Force of the Pacific as executions, four massive displacements have occurred involving 232 families that went to Buenaventura and Cali. Some residents of La Concepcion and Juan Santo also took refuge in neighboring communities such as Las Pavas, San Lorenzo, San Bartolo, San Francisco and La Y. Moreover, ""people have been confined and cannot go out to harvest their crops or hunt for fear of getting shot because the assailants and security forces are scattered throughout the area,"" explains a source who requested to remain anonymous. The source went on to say that the situation is ""the result of non-compliance with the peace accords because no institutions have arrived there, and these kinds of situations are created as a result."" After spending two days in the region, Ombudsman Carlos Negret said that the most affected populations are from the communities of Concepcion, Las Pavas, San Francisco and Joaquincito. ""The community has told us that some families went to Buenaventura due to the events of May 5. There is confinement in sectors where the illegal groups don't allow the communities to go out to fish and harvest their crops, which is why we need greater security and navy presence in these areas,"" he said. Regarding victim assistance, Secretary Cardozo says that next Sunday they will hold a meeting in the town of Puerto Merizalde with the community council to assess what is happening in the region regarding humanitarian and security efforts. ""Of course, keeping in mind the demands the communities shared with us during our visit and our response to them."" He adds that all the institutions present in the region the previous week would give a joint report to the governors of the Cauca and Valle del Cauca departments so they can take action on the matter. According to one leader in the region, such meetings can be key to preventing the situation from worsening and increasing risk to residents. Once again, as in 2001, the communities of the Naya region are being plunged into the anguish of guns and illegal economies. The violence has not disappeared with the FARC and, for now, not with the government either. *This article was originally published by Verdad Abierta and was translated, edited and reprinted by InSight Crime with permission.

"Mexico Forces Pour into Michoacan to Capture La Tuta. Some 1,800 Federal Police gathered in the west Mexico state of Michoacan in order to track down the leader of drug trafficking organization the Caballeros Templarios. Black Hawk helicopters, armored vehicles and ambulances have been sent to this crime-ridden state in search of Servando Gomez Martines, alias ""La Tuta,"" leader of the Caballeros Templarios, reports Milenio. The security forces have taken control of major road networks in the state, following the use of roadblocks by the criminal organization in recent weeks. The Caballeros Templarios (Knights Templar) is a splinter group of the Familia Michoacana drug gang, which emerged earlier this year in the state of Michoacan. On Thursday, confrontations between security forces and suspected members of the group left at least seven dead and three police injured. Jose de Jesus Mendez Vargas, alias "" El Chango ,"" who led the other faction of the Familia, was captured in June , leading the authorities to say the organization was on the verge of being wiped out.

Honduras: 23 Journalists Murdered Since 2007. Honduras' National Commission for Human Rights reports that 23 journalists have been murdered in the country since 2007; 16 of these since the 2009 coup that ousted President Manuel Zelaya. Human Rights Commissioner Ramon Custodio said that only three of these cases had been resolved by police. The most recent victim, Medardo Flores, was a journalist with Radio Uno in the Caribbean coastal city of Puerto Cortes and was active in a pro-Zelaya movement. He was ambushed and shot dead while driving his car in early September. Honduran security officials have suggested that the deaths of 23 journalists should be blamed on common crime or personal disputes , but many of the victims have been linked to Zelayista groups, according to AFP news agency. The country is currently one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist, according to the commission. The current president, Porfirio Lobo, has requested investigative support from the FBI and Spanish authorities. Honduras' murder rate is on track to reach 86 per 100,000 by the end of 2011. 	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Peru Cocaine Clans Expanding in Bolivia: Police. Bolivia is now reportedly home to at least 20 drug clans from Peru, providing an indication of how the presence of transnational organized crime has grown in the country as it has emerged as the principal transit point for Peruvian drug flights. According to drug trafficking specialist Jaime Antezana and information from Peru's anti-drug body (DIRANDRO), these 20 family-based clans now operate out of Bolivia, shipping in then refining Peruvian cocaine paste, reported El Comerico. While some members are in prison and others are wanted by authorities, they continue to operate freely, said an unidentified intelligence source. The director of Bolivia's anti-drug force (FELCN), Alexander Rojas, said a kilo of Peruvian cocaine paste -- worth around $1,000 in Peru's Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valley region (VRAEM) -- costs $1,500 in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz, reported El Deber. After being converted into powder form in clandestine laboratories, the kilo is worth $10,000 on the Brazilian market and up to $50,000 in Europe, he said. According to El Comericio's DIRANDRO sources, 50 percent of the 450 tons of cocaine leaving Peru each year are trafficked by air, and of this, 95 percent is destined for Bolivia. The majority of flights leave from the VRAEM. So far this year, authorities have seized over 1.5 tons of cocaine on six Bolivian planes. The Peruvian cocaine air bridge once connected to Colombia, but was shut down by an intensive US-assisted aerial campaign in the 1990s. It has now reemerged with a new destination: Bolivia. From there, the drugs are trafficked to the large Brazilian and Argentine domestic markets, as well as on to Europe. Peru is the world's top coca and cocaine producer , and the VRAEM is the epicenter of the drug trade, producing an estimated 200 tons of cocaine each year. Ninety percent of this is trafficked out of the region by air , according to Peruvian security expert Ruben Vargas. The pilots are often Bolivian , and an experienced pilot can make up to $25,000 per flight. The most recent reports indicate how Peruvians now control not only coca production and transport out of the country, but also are increasingly involved on the Bolivian end. A 2012 IDL-Reporteros report indicated Peru's drug clans had begun setting up operations in Bolivia as they were increasingly using the country to refine cocaine. Bolivia -- and particularly the crime hub Santa Cruz -- has become home to a well-established foreign organized crime presence as its status as a transit country has grown. The country reportedly hosts up to 3,000 Colombian drug traffickers, emissaries from Brazil's principal drug groups, and even local robbery gangs with an international membership.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Ecuador Touts Increased Cocaine Seizures in 2011. Police in Ecuador claim to have seized significantly more cocaine this year than last, but total cocaine seizures are still far lower than in 2009. El Comercio reports reports that the chief of the Ecuadorian National Police's anti-narcotics division recently announced that officials have seized 25 metric tons of cocaine so far this year. This is 30 percent more than 2010, in which authorities claimed to have seized 18 tons. However, the figure is still far lower than the amount of cocaine seized in 2009, which the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said was 65 tons. On top of this, it is unclear whether this increase is due to improved interdiction efforts or the country's growing importance as a cocaine transit route. According to the U.S. Department of State's 2011 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report , around 220 tons of cocaine pass through Ecuador each year. The trend seems to be increasing, as both Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations are thought to be deepening operations in the country. Indeed, the diversity of transnational criminal groups that are based in Ecuador caused one U.S. drug official to refer to country as the "" UN of organized crime "" in July. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
The Pros and Cons of Absorbing Mexicos Gendarmerie into the Federal Police. Mexico's government has decided to make the controversial Gendarmerie -- a key component of President Enrique Pena Nieto's national security policy -- part of the national police force. Security analyst Alejandro Hope examines the positive and negative implications of this decision. There has been a new twist in the Gendarmerie matter. Last Friday, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong announced that the Gendarmerie will be a unit of the Federal Police, initially composed of 5,000 members with military and police training. This decision is a significant change to the original project and merits various comments, some positive and others not so much. First comes the good: 1. The interior minister had the good grace to meet , prior to the announcement, with civil society organizations and specialists interested in the matter, in order to discuss the new design of the Gendarmerie and to solicit contributions and commentary. Given the importance that we in civil society have placed on extensive debate regarding the topic, the opportunity to listen to contrasting opinions was appreciated. I hope this attitude will persist in the future, in this and other matters. 2. He listened to one of the principal critiques that various people had regarding the initial proposal: the fact that the parallel operation of the Gendarmerie and the Federal Police would have the potential to create very serious jurisdictional conflicts, as occurs in all countries that have a dual police system. By placing the Gendarmerie within the Federal Police, this risk disappears by definition. I don't know about others, but I am happy about the change and, above all, the fact that the authorities have chosen to rectify the situation before placing the country on a path difficult to turn back from. Now, the not so good: 1. I am constantly surprised by the habit of this government to break the announcement of important decisions into seperate statements. Even if we already know that the Gendarmerie will form part of the Federal Police, they are still failing to address its precise administrative position, its relationship with units given similar mandates (the Federal Assistance Forces and the Division of Regional Security), the employment status of its members (commissioned soldiers, or civilians with military training?), its impact on the budget and its possible growth trajectory (how many members does it hope to recruit, above the initial 5,000?). Wouldn't it be better to save the announcement until they had defined all of these details? We would save ourselves a lot of ink, many comings and goings, many doubts and many meetings. 2. I still don't understand what it is that they are hoping to achieve. The best argument in favor of the Gendarmerie (articulated not so much by the government, but by some intelligent supporters of the new body) was that an intermediate body created with clear military origin and identity could take advantage of the positive image of the armed forces (in comparison to the police) to gain the confidence of civilians, without directly involving the army and the navy in public security tasks. By placing the Gendarmerie within the Federal Police, this advantage is lost; like it or not, the gendarmes will be seen as police. In that case, why not simply recruit 5,000 more national police? With military training, if they want. Reforming the control structures and mechanisms, if that is necessary. But what exactly is the point in creating an additional administrative unit? I do not understand. 3. If the Gendarmerie is not going to be of the size originally proposed, the obvious implication is that the armed forces are going to continue to be involved in public security matters for a long time. If this is the case, it is absolutely urgent to regulate this participation. Following this decision, the government should reopen debate over the National Security Law , the domestic security regime and the regulation of Article 29 of the Constitution. If not, the army and the navy are going to continue to tread dangerous legal ground, as well described by Supreme Court Minister Jose Ramon Cossio a year ago. In sum, it is the wise who change their minds. The rectification of the project speaks well of the government; it tells us that they are not deaf to the questions being asked by society. Nonetheless, with the decision taken last week, we are back to square one: how do we strengthen state control of the territory? How do we avoid resorting to the armed forces for jobs that do not correspond to them in the first place? What do we do to have trustworthy and effective police bodies? The answers continue to await. P.S. I have been very distant in recent weeks. The excuse is that I have been travelling. The reality is that I needed to recharge my batteries before continuing the conversation that I have sustained with you, my dear readers, for the past two years. I hope you will excuse me.

"El Salvador Tycoon, ex-AG Accused of Heading Organized Crime Structure. A court in El Salvador has ruled that a corruption network run by a former attorney general and powerful businessman constituted an organized criminal structure, officially confirming what many had believed for years. Officials in El Salvador said that former Attorney General Luis Martinez and prominent businessman Enrique Rais created an organized criminal association that was ""led by a decision making center that gave orders to buy justice,"" the Attorney General's Office said in a January 25 tweet. Authorities arrested both Martinez and Rais in August 2016 on judicial corruption charges for conspiring to defraud the justice system on several occasions. The case at the center of the investigation involves a multimillion-dollar lawsuit involving two former partners in Rais' waste disposal company, MIDES S.A. de C.V. Authorities allege Martinez and Rais entered into an ""improper"" relationship to advance the latter's legal agenda. The judges determined that Martinez and Rais, along with others, corrupted the justice system using a structure that met the requirements established by the country's organized crime law: It was a hierarchical organization composed of two or more people with defined roles who acted together with the intention of committing a crime, according to La Prensa Grafica. The structure had three levels, according to the judges. The businessmen, led by Rais, gave orders to their group of lawyers who then allegedly bribed public officials. In one instance, a legal medicine expert confessed to receiving $5,000 in exchange for lying about supposed psychological problems that Rais and one of his co-conspirators allegedly had in an official report, according to La Prensa Grafica. The business tycoon has since fled to Switzerland where he is hiding out to avoid the charges he faces in El Salvador. The court's ruling that the corruption ring led by Rais and Martinez constituted an organized criminal structure is not surprising, but it is significant, as it shows authorities in El Salvador clearly identifying this type of organization as such. Rais was the perfect example of the intersection between organized crime, powerful elites and the state in El Salvador. Travelers in airplanes owned by Rais reportedly included Martinez , former Honduras President Porfirio Lobo and outgoing El Salvador President Salvador Sanchez Ceren, as well as a number of other members of his administration. Rais' planes were seized by US authorities in Florida, but the case calling for their forfeiture was later dropped and the aircraft returned. Rais was also an important political player who helped propel Martinez to attorney general in 2012, lobbying through the controversial politician Jose Luis Merino of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional - FMLN) and Guillermo Gallegos of the Grand Alliance for National Unity (Gran Alianza por la Unidad Nacional - GANA). Martinez is currently accused of turning the Attorney General's Office into a pay-to-play shop, where he was gifted vehicles, credit cards, trips and monthly bonuses of up to $20,000 for stopping or delaying corruption investigations. The links between elites in El Salvador and organized crime stretch back years, but times may be changing after the recent election of Nayib Bukele as the country's next president. His election ended 30 years of two-party rule. The president-elect ran largely on an anti-corruption ticket pledging to root out graft in part by installing an internationally-backed commission against impunity and corruption."	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"Police Stole Cocaine Shipment in Paraguay. Paraguay officials say police based along the Brazilian border stole a shipment of seized cocaine, more evidence of official corruption in the Southern Cone country. About 252 kilos of cocaine, seized by Paraguayan police, went missing from a police station in Amambay province on January 11. Eight days later, Interior Minister Francisco de Vargas called a press conference and said that the police were involved in the disappearance. ABC Color reported that police may have delivered the cocaine to a suspected trafficker known as ""the Gringo."" De Vargas also said that despite warnings of a possible robbery, the local police chief took no extra precautions to secure the cocaine and still went on a planned vacation. The building where the cocaine was held showed no signs of forced entry; nor was there any violence during the robbery, all signs that suggest it was an inside job. At least five high-ranking police officials in Amambay have been replaced since the cocaine shipment was reported missing, reported ABC. Insight Crime Analysis The scandal is further evidence of endemic corruption in Paraguay, which has hindered efforts to combat drug trafficking. Director of Paraguay's anti-drug body the SENAD Luis Rojas recently said the country is ""the cheapest and least risky route"" for drug trafficking in the region, partly due to weak political and judicial institutions. In other comments made to the press , Rojas said he suspected that the disappeared cocaine shipment was headed to Brazil, the second largest consumer of cocaine in the world. Amambay province is a particularly attractive route for drug traffickers due to its proximity to the Brazilian border. While Paraguay is South America's largest producer of marijuana, it is also a major transit nation for cocaine, and is used by traffickers to move cocaine from Bolivia and Peru into Brazil and Argentina."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador will Target and Disband Criminal Structures: Vice President. To halt criminal violence in the country, El Salvador's vice president has outlined additional government measures that echo repressive strategies of the past, but which also include several new approaches. In an interview with the Salvadoran press, Vice President Oscar Ortiz detailed several initiatives President Salvador Sanchez Ceren will propose to Congress in an attempt to decrease sky-rocketing violence rates. Ortiz told El Mundo the goal of the new measures was to ""drastically reduce the operating capacity of criminal structures."" The new strategies include a Rapid Response Force (Fuerza de Reaccion Rapida) of 600 soldiers and 400 police officers, which will be tasked with ""targeting and disbanding any [criminal] structure"" in the country. Ortiz said officials also hope to form a team of prosecutors that will focus specifically on cases the new response unit uncovers. Plans are also underway to increase local participation in neighborhood security by supporting the creation of citizen support committees in communities. These will operate under the coordination of the National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil). Additionally, the presidency plans to present a new initiative to strengthen asset seizure laws in order to ""attack the financial flows of criminal structures,"" said Ortiz. The proposals follow plans, approved by Congress on April 1 , to tighten prison restrictions in order to impede the ability of inmates to coordinate criminal activities outside prison walls. Following up on these measures, Ortiz noted the government will soon begin construction on temporary centers where 10,000 low-risk inmates will live and work. Ortiz said gang members are unlikely to be eligible for the program, at least in its initial phase. Ortiz's comments seem to indicate the Salvadoran government is moving closer to a coordinated security strategy with more defined measures, which contain both new aspects and reflections of past policies. For instance, the Rapid Response Force echoes ""mano dura"" (iron fist) policies of repression the Salvadoran government has used before. Such policies, however, have been shown to be unsuccessful at reducing crime. Although Ortiz claims the unit will be part of a sustained effort involving the Attorney General's office to tackle and prosecute criminal structures, it remains unclear how exactly this is to be done. Attacking the assets of criminal groups, however, is a newer strategy for Salvadoran officials. While such an approach has shown some success in neighboring Honduras, questions again remain as to how Salvadoran police will coordinate with the Attorney General to conduct asset seizure operations. Another unknown is how El Salvador's powerful street gangs will respond to the government's new security initiatives. Last week, Salvadoran gangs declared a halt to homicides , allegedly to demonstrate that the government's threatened ""extraordinary measures"" were not necessary. In an interview with the Washington Post , a Barrio 18 representative responded to the newly rolled out policies, saying, ""The governments have invented these kinds of measures before, and what I have to say about it is this: Repression doesn't reduce violence, it just brings more repression."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Vigilante Boom Set to Continue. Mexico's citizen self-defense or vigilante groups have made major shows of strength as the year has begun, indicating that last year's surge of power and growth may increase during 2014. In Guerrero, the two major, and formerly rival, vigilante groups, the Union of Peoples and Organizations of the State of Guerrero (Upoeg) and the Regional Coordinator of Community Authorities (CRAC), announced they were now united, reported Milenio. More than 10,000 members of both groups were applauded by local people as they marched together in the town of Ayutla de los Libres. The groups now have ""one solo voice, one solo strength, one solo integral agenda,"" said Felix Ramirez, one of the regional representatives. Meanwhile in the state of Michoacan, dozens of armed members of self-defense groups took control of the town of Paracuaro over the weekend and detained more than 15 police officers, reported Animal Politico. The action followed a statement by the secretary of the Michoacan state government, Jesus Reyna, in which he refused to enter into dialogue with self-defense group leaders and said his priority would be restoring ""institutional normality,"" reported Milenio. A week earlier, more than 250 armed vigilantes marched into the town of Churumuco, where the leader of the Michoacan Self-Defense Groups Council Jose Manuel Mireles told EFE that ""nothing and no one"" would be able to stop the groups' advance -- they would liberate the people from the drug gang of the Knights Templar, he said. Mireles was seriously injured last week when a plane he was traveling in crashed, reported Proceso. The self-defense movement exploded in Mexico during 2012 and 2013, particularly in Guerrero and Michoacan, where the groups have been received very differently by their respective regional governments. It is no coincidence that Guerrero and Michoacan are two of Mexico's most violent states; the self-defense groups say citizens have no choice but to take up arms themselves in the face of the state's complete inability to provide security. Upoeg came into existence as a splinter and rival group of the CRAC, and the two umbrella organizations have had acrimonious disputes ever since. Together and united, the two groups will make what was already a major presence in Guerrero's security landscape a very powerful force -- 10,000 members in a population of around 3.4 million. Meanwhile Michoacan vigilantes' aggressive start to the year indicates a movement that is determined, strong and set to continue its offensives against criminal groups. There are serious concerns the self-defense groups will follow the Latin American trend of morphing into paramilitary outfits, which then get involved in criminal activities, a scenario played out most powerfully in Colombia during the 1980s and 1990s. How the vigilante movement progresses in 2014 could determine whether Mexico follows a similar path."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Ban on Migrants Riding Train Unlikely to Stem Abuses. Authorities have barred hundreds of migrants in Mexico from boarding the infamous cargo train ""La Bestia"" (the Beast) destined for the United States, though the measure is unlikely to stop them attempting the perilous journey and may leave them even more exposed to attacks by criminals. The decision came after the state of Veracruz accused railway companies Kansas City Southern and Ferrosul of endangering migrants using the freight train network by making unscheduled stops that allowed criminals to board the train. ""What the train drivers and some directors of the railway companies have told us is that the decision to stop the migrants boarding the train is due to the reports filed against them [the companies] by the government of [the state of] Veracruz,"" Ruben Figueroa, an activist with the Mesoamerican Migrant Movement, told Animal Politico. Since the week of April 21, approximately 800 migrants have been unable to leave the southern municipalities of Tenosique (Tabasco) and Palenque (Chiapas), two major gathering spots for migrants hoping to hop on the train. Many of those stranded are Central American migrants -- La Prensa reported hundreds of Hondurans are among their numbers. The journey on La Bestia brings with it a host of dangers, including lost limbs and death -- one derailment in 2013 left up to 50 dead and 300 wounded. But the biggest fear among migrants is the threat posed by criminal organizations that extort and kidnap migrants , sometimes attacking them en masse. Up to 80 percent of migrants journeying north are assaulted or robbed, while 60 percent of female travelers are raped. According to a recent report from Animal Politico , migrants must pay an average of $100 each to criminal groups to ride the train. The travails of the journey hit front pages in Mexico in early April when 15 people mutilated while travelling on the train addressed the Senate and demanded to speak to President Enrique Pena Nieto. Yet preventing migrants using the train is unlikely to make the situation any better. An estimated flow of up to 500,000 migrants make the journey through Mexico to the United States every year, and they will simply be forced to use alternative routes already in existence. Much of the attraction presented by La Bestia is the opportunity to travel a long distance in a relatively short time. Using alternative routes could expose them to longer and even more treacherous journeys, potentially making them even more vulnerable to organized crime."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

"Nicaragua Police Seize Precursor Chemicals for Meth Production. Police announced the arrest of seven people and the seizure of 80 barrels of precursor chemicals, reportedly aimed at setting up a methamphetamine lab in Nicaragua, one sign that the industry could be spreading outside of Mexico. The 4,400 gallons of chemicals in the barrels included acetone, a key ingredient for meth production, reports El Nuevo Diario. Police are reportedly investigating 13 people linked to the primitive lab, including two Mexicans. Police spokesperson Glenda Zavela said that trafficking organizations have been trying to introduce meth to Nicaragua since 2011. Mexico is still the region's primary producer of meth, the supplier of up to 80 percent of the meth consumed in the US. But as a 2011 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report observed , seizures of precursor chemicals in other Central American countries are rising, and meth labs are appearing in some countries where there was previously no history of meth production. Nicaragua discovered its first methaphetamine lab in 2009. Even though the US State Department has identified Nicaragua as a ""producer and supplier of methaphetamine,"" so far the problem appears to be relatively limited. Nicaragua has taken several steps to try and combat the issue, passing a law in April 2011 that restricts the importation, production, and distribution of phenyl acetic acid, a key precursor chemical for meth.

"Chance Meeting Raises More Questions about Mexico Vigilantes. A meeting between a senior government official and a leading member of Mexico's self-defense militias in Michoacan has put both sides on the defensive after details emerged of the vigilante leader's alleged ties to drug cartels. On February 5, the Mexican government's special security envoy to Michoacan, Alfredo Castillo, met with Juan Jose Farias, alias ""El Abuelo,"" a member of the self-defense militias who was signaled by security forces and witnesses to be a regional commander of the Valencia clan, also known as the Milenio Cartel. Farias was arrested in 2009 on weapons and drugs charges. He was sentenced to three years in prison but had already served the time while on remand and his conviction was later quashed on appeal. In interviews with the Mexican media, Castillo admitted meeting Farias but insisted he had approached the official as ""just one more citizen"" at a public event and the talk had not been pre-arranged, reported Proceso. The Michoacan vigilantes responded to the scandal by denying Farias' cartel ties. One of the militias' main spokespeople, Hipolito Mora, told Excelsior Farias had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice and that police had planted the weapons and drugs on him when they arrested him. The scandal has also drawn in Farias' brother, Uriel, alias ""El Paisa,"" a former mayor of Tepalcatepec and the founder of the vigilantes in that municipality. Like his brother, Uriel was accused of involvement in the Milenio Cartel and later absolved. Insight Crime Analysis While the accusations of the Farias brothers links to drug cartels have never stuck in court, the suspicion buzzing around them is not a good sign for the vigilante movement, nor for the government, which is now moving to try and legalize the movement. From the very beginning, rumors of cartel connections have swirled around the militias, ranging from accusations levied by their enemies in the Knights Templar to recent announcement by the Attorney General's Office that they were investigating claims the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation were providing them arms. The appearance of the Farias brothers fits into that narrative perfectly. The Milenio Cartel was displaced by the Familia Michoacana in the mid-2000s. The Familia later split and parts of it formed the Knights Templar, which have since become the reason for the current vigilante uprising. Now it appears as if the former overlords could be making a comeback. In regions such as Michoacan, the line between narcos, politicians and businessmen can often be blurred, and as the vigilantes grow and gain power and influence, the more likely they are to attract murky figures looking to co-opt or manipulate them. Such characters may have shady backgrounds, but they can also often offer something the militias desperately need: funding. According to a recent investigation by Cronica , the vigilantes need over $2.4 million a month to operate -- excluding what is spent on arms and munitions. While they receive donations from sympathizers abroad , claim to sell lemons at home , and receive ""voluntary"" protection money from companies , it still may be hard to cover the costs."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Leaked Videos Show Inner Workings of Paraguays EPP Guerrillas. More than 60 videos filmed by Paraguay's EPP guerrillas have been leaked to the media, offering an unprecedented insight into the clandestine operations of one of Latin America's newest insurgent groups. The videos were recovered from a camera belonging to Paraguayan People's Army (EPP) leader Bernardo Bernal Maiz, who was killed in a firefight with the military in April, ABC Color reported. They were reportedly leaked to the media from those investigating the kidnapping of 16-year-old Arlan Fick Bremm, who has now been held captive for 70 days. According to Ultima Hora , the videos show the EPP conducting surveillance operations of ranches in the lead up to kidnapping operations, including that of Fick Bremm's family. The footage also shows the EPP's training excercises and the group's main encampment, depicting a total of 18 soldiers -- including seven women and various underage members -- according to Ultima Hora. Authorities have used the footage to identify a number of previously unknown EPP leaders and members, Ultima Hora reported. Along with the group's operations, the videos also revealed footage from the 2009 kidnapping of farmer Fidel Zavala and his eventual $550,000 ransom payment -- airdropped into the jungle by a light plane (see below and bottom). The videos offer an unusual opportunity to see the activities of a guerrilla group that was only formally constituted in 2008 and about which little is known. As the footage demonstrates, the EPP have followed the route taken by other insurgent organizations elsewhere in their early years -- most notably the Revoultionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) -- by funding themselves through kidnapping. There have been indications the EPP could continue to evolve along similar lines as their Colombian counterparts, by branching out into the drug trade. In 2013, Paraguayan authorities claimed to have uncovered ties between the EPP and the region's drug traffickers, who they said supplied the rebels with arms in exchange for protection. Although thought to have only between 20 and 100 members, the EPP have become the security priority of President Horacio Cartes. However, security forces have so far had mixed results and the guerrilla group appears to be maintaining business as usual.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Cachiros Knew About Honduras Police Operation: Official. Honduras authorities announced that 71 bank accounts confiscated from the Cachiros were found empty, a sign of how institutional corruption is likely to hamper moves against the well-connected drug trafficking organization. Director of the Administrative Office of Seized Goods (OABI) Humberto Palacios Moya confirmed that the accounts had been emptied and moveable assets such as cars and machinery removed from properties before they were confiscated. Palacios said the apparent advance notice the group had of the operation against them suggests there was a leak from within the police, reported La Prensa. Last month Honduran authorities, with strong assistance (and insistence) from US authorities, seized an estimated $800 million of property and assets from the Cachiros as part of ""Operation Neptune."" Police Chief Juan Carlos ""El Tigre"" Bonilla declaring authorities would ""drain the water of the fish and then go after them."" And US authorities made bold statements that this was just the beginning. However, no arrests have yet been made and, according to El Heraldo , a man renting one of the confiscated properties was warned a month in advance that authorities would reclaim the property. The ability of the Cachiros to infiltrate the operation against them comes as little surprise. The group is one of Honduras' most powerful and Honduran police suffer from endemic corruption. Bonilla himself has been tied to corruption and death squads. However, the police are also an easy scapegoat. The Cachiros are known to have connections in the upper reaches of Honduran society and politics, so there are powerful actors with a vested interest in their continued immunity, among them the owners of the banks, which represent some of the wealthiest Honduran elite. This is backed up by the fact that the leak was apparently made at least a month before the historic operation. The leak is even more troubling given the small circle with which the US Treasury, which helped oversee the investigation, is working. The evidence suggests it came from someone involved in, or connected to, those responsible for planning the operation."	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"LatAm Deadliest Region for Environmental Defenders: Report. A Brazilian environmental defender shows the lesions she claims are a result of the water pollution in Barcarena, Brazil. Image courtesy of Global Witness More land and environmental activists were killed in Latin America last year than anywhere else in the world, according to a new report, underscoring how shifting organized crime dynamics put environmental defenders at greater risk. A total of some 207 land and environmental defenders were killed in 2017, according to the new report from the watchdog group Global Witness. Nearly 60 percent of those killings took place in Latin America, making it the deadliest year on record for this community. Brazil recorded the largest number of killings in the region with 57, while Colombia and Mexico recorded the next highest with 24 and 15, respectively, according to the report. Mexico and Peru saw ""marked increases"" in killings between 2016 and 2017 as the number of killings jumped 400 percent in Mexico, and 300 percent in Peru. There was also a significant decrease in the number of land defenders killed in Honduras, down from 14 in 2016 to five in 2017, although the report stressed that the repression of civil society is ""worse than ever."" According to the report, the agribusiness industry is one of the main sectors driving attacks against land defenders, in addition to mining and extractive industries and logging. Criminal gangs were often found to be the suspected perpetrators, followed by soldiers, police and paramilitary forces. In addition, the report found that there are a number of factors that ""accentuate and perpetuate"" the risks that land defenders face, including widespread impunity that gives the ""green light"" to potential attackers and corruption among government officials and businesses that sometimes also collude with criminal groups. https://www.insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/RS5900_Environmental-Defenders_Full-Cut_Sharenow.mp4 (Video courtesy of Global Witness) These latest findings reinforce the growing threat that land and environmental activists face when they threaten the lucrative criminal activities of organized crime groups in Latin America, and how shifting criminal dynamics can put them at greater risk. For example, the report makes a direct link between the drastic increase in the murders of land defenders in Mexico to a ""massive rise"" in organized crime-related murders nationwide. Indeed, organized crime-related homicides reached a record high in 2017 amid an increasingly fragmented criminal landscape. Colombia is also undergoing intense criminal fragmentation after the demobilization of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), and was again among the top three most dangerous countries for land and environmental defenders last year. Social leaders continue to be killed at an alarming rate so far in 2018 as competing criminal organizations battle for control over illicit economies. But organized crime is not the only actor at fault. On the other hand, legislative and other reforms have put Brazil's environmental activists in greater harm. The report found that Brazil President Michel Temer has ""systematically weakened the legislation, institutions and budgets"" that could have protected human rights defenders and ""skewed the balance of power"" against activists. This has contributed to Brazil holding the rank as the most dangerous country to be a land defender in Latin America for the last decade. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"MS13 Pooled Resources to Fund Elite Unit: Report. A new report seems to indicate that various branches of the MS13 gang in El Salvador attempted to pool their resources in order to fund an elite unit as a response to a government crackdown on their operations. An October 11 article published by El Diario de Hoy reported that telephone conversations intercepted by Salvadoran authorities appear to show MS13 leaders plotting to train and equip the unit using funds derived from the criminal activities of the gang's various ""clicas,"" or cliques. The conversations were intercepted as part of ""Operacion Jaque"" (Operation Check), an ongoing investigation launched in 2015 that initially targeted the MS13's financial structures and continues to provide a vast amount of information concerning various aspects of the gang's organization. The Salvadoran Attorney General's Office had previously filed a report in August 2016 alleging that suspected MS13 leader, Marvin Adaly Quintanilla Ramos, alias ""Piwa,"" had planned to create an elite unit composed of 500 gang members, with the two best foot soldiers from each of the gang's 249 nationwide cliques being recruited, trained and equipped with high-powered rifles. The plan was apparently fomented as a response to the government's decision to increase prison security measures , and in particular to cut off incarcerated gang leaders' communications with the outside world. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Prisons But the report from El Diario de Hoy suggests that the formation of the elite unit was part of a larger plot by the MS13 aimed at reducing the impact of the ""extraordinary measures."" According to the news outlet, the MS13's ""Plan A"" came about after the gang learned of the government's intention to implement a new penitentiary policy two weeks before the official announcement in April 2016. In response, MS13 leaders reportedly joined forces with their rivals in the Barrio 18 gang to identify the new security measures with which they would be targeted, and they subsequently publicly ordered their members on March 26 to stop gang-related killings in the hope that the government would backtrack. ""Plan A"" reportedly made clear that this action had to be promoted through the media as a show of goodwill on behalf of the gangs. Yet while ""Plan A"" initially succeeded in lowering the level of violence in the country, it apparently did not affect the government's intention to clamp down on incarcerated gang leaders. Nevertheless, El Diario de Hoy reported, MS13 leaders had also prepared a ""Plan B."" ""Plan B"" allegedly consisted of creating a fund to pool all the illicit proceeds of the gang's nationwide activities over the course of a month. This fund, which reportedly reached the sum of $600,800, was meant to serve as the financial resource needed for the creation of the 500-man unit. The money appears to have been intended to finance the training of the unit's operatives and the acquisition of military-grade equipment, including high-powered firearms, explosives and weapons to shoot down helicopters. In two intercepted phone calls made by Piwa to other suspected MS13 leaders towards the end of March, the now-incarcerated protagonist reportedly said that making contributions to the fund was mandatory, and that due to the clicas' vast annual resources, transferring money to the fund once or twice per year on the basis of a month's worth of extortion money would give the gang the resources necessary to fight back against the state and its institutions. The ultimate phase of the MS13's strategy, ""Plan C,"" reportedly involved the actual use of the elite unit to commit attacks against various public and private institutions in what would have amounted to a terror campaign and a high-intensity conflict against the government. Apparently, however, this phase of the plan was never realized. Although reports of the MS13's attempted creation of an elite unit had already surfaced, the revelations surrounding the unit's funding through the nationwide pooling of extortion money suggest that gang leaders were taking concrete steps toward building such an armed faction. However, there are several factors that would have made this plan difficult to execute, most notably the gang's horizontal structure and lack of centralized leadership. Still, it is concerning that MS13 leaders appear to have been plotting a coordinated assault on El Salvador's public institutions. Violent confrontations between gangs and security forces have occurred at a rate of more than one per day in 2016, and El Salvador had already registered at least 4,000 homicides as of September. If the gang's ""Plan C"" had come to fruition, violence in El Salvador would likely have skyrocketed from the attacks by the militarized elite unit, cancelling out the slight but steady reduction in reported killings observed this year compared to last. SEE ALSO : El Salvador News and Profiles The level of confidence and ambition with which the MS13 reportedly fomented a plan to intensify their conflict with the state is worrying to say the least. But it is interesting to observe that this was averted, in part, due to the unfolding of an investigation that originally targeted the gang's financial structure. Latin American governments, including El Salvador , have often turned to militarized strategies in order to confront organized crime. Yet these strategies often have adverse consequences for human rights and fail to have sustainable impacts on levels of violence or the presence of criminal organizations. Targeting the finances of criminal organizations could thus represent an alternative but effective strategy to diminish their power by hitting their most crucial resource. Such a strategy may also help avoid increasing the level of violence associated with criminal activity by not only avoiding the intensification of conflict between the state and criminal groups, but also by chipping away at criminals' ability to acquire increased manpower and firepower."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Closes Bank as Elite Money Laundering Case Hits Savers. One of Honduras' biggest banks is to be liquidated as a result of the money laundering investigation into the powerful Rosenthal family, raising concerns over due process and how the scandal could affect ordinary Hondurans. On October 11, Honduras' banking regulator the National Commission of Banks and Securities (CNBS) ordered the closure of Banco Continental -- Honduras' eighth largest bank -- following the revelation bank owner Jaime Rosenthal had been indicted in the United States on money laundering charges, reported EFE. Officials said the bank will remain closed until October 14 and will eventually undergo a ""forced liquidation."" The news sparked alarm among Banco Continental's more than 220,000 clients, who Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez assured could begin withdrawing around $9,000 of their deposits starting October 14. The move also raised concerns over the future of the other companies that are part of the Rosenthals' umbrella company, Grupo Continental, which has around 11,000 employees, according to the AP. Mario Solis, manager of Seguros Continental, the Rosenthals' insurance company, called the bank's liquidation a ""financial tsunami"" for Honduras, adding that it raises uncertainty over questions such as the future of company employees. The US indictment that initiated the action also named Jaime Rosenthal's son Yani , his nephew Yankel, who was arrested in Miami on October 6 , and a company lawyer. In addition, the US Treasury Department named the three Rosenthals as ""Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers."" US prosecutors allege the Rosenthals used their network of businesses, including the bank, to launder money for Central American drug traffickers. This includes the Cachiros, whose members were designated in 2013 by the US Treasury Department and have been linked to Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. Honduran authorities' sudden decision to liquidate Banco Continental raises several concerns. First is a question of due process. The indicted Rosenthals have not yet faced a judge , much less been tried and convicted of the money laundering charges for which they are accused. Additionally, despite the US indictment, Honduras' attorney general has no existing investigations into the Rosenthals for either money laundering or drug trafficking. Nonetheless, the family is being ruined financially. Next is a concern over the effects the bank's liquidation will have on ordinary Hondurans, particularly employees of the Rosenthals' business empire. By closing down the family's financial arm, it is possible thousands of people will lose their jobs, potentially pushing the newly unemployed into more informal -- or even criminal -- means of earning a living. Such an occurrence is not without precedent in Honduras. For instance, following the seizure of properties of the Valle Valle clan -- another powerful Honduran family implicated in drug trafficking -- hundreds of employees found their livelihoods had disappeared and marched in protest, demanding the government guarantee their future employment. Ultimately, Honduran authorities need to be taking steps to tackle corruption and crime -- within due process -- but the deep intertwining of elites and organized crime in the country means removing the former from the picture may produce a damaging trickle down effect on average citizens."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Venezuela to Adopt Shoot-Down Policy for Suspected Drug Flights. Venezuela's Congress has approved legislation which will allow the use of force against aircraft suspected of carrying shipments of illegal drugs. On May 23 the National Assembly, Venezuela's unicameral legislative body, unanimously approved a law which allows the Bolivarian National Air Force to ""intercept, dissuade and disable"" aircraft violating Venezuela air space regulations. The passage of the law is a victory for President Hugo Chavez, who has been one of its major proponents. In October the Venezuelan leader addressed the issue in a televised speech, saying that the new law was necessary in order to crack down on drug trafficking in the country. According to Chavez, when air force planes intercept planes suspected of carrying drugs, the pilots often ignore orders to land, leaving the military unable to stop them. Venezuela has become a major transit nation for Colombian drugs, and United Nations anti-drug officials claim it is the principal source of cocaine bound for the European market. It is also believed to be a significant launching point for air traffic bringing the drug to Central America and the Caribbean. Honduras, which an estimated 88 percent of US-bound drugs pass through, has become the favorite destination of Venezuelan pilots carrying drug shipments. A recent drug operation in Honduras, for instance, which caused controversy over claims that US agents were involved in the death of four innocent people, was made possible by Colombian and US radar equipment picking up a suspicious flight leaving Venezuela. Because of Chavez's historically chilly relationship with both countries, Venezuela does not share intelligence on drug flights with them, limiting its capacity to track drug flights. The Chavez government has* purchased long-range JYL-1 radars from the Chinese government, but Venezuela is not expected to acheive full radar coverage of its airspace until 2013. The new law is also troubling from a human rights perspective, as a policy advocating the use of force against civilian aircraft carries risk. Although a similar strategy is credited with vastly reducing drug flights from Peru, the program was suspended in 2001 after the military mistakenly shot down a plane carrying US missionaries, killing a 7-month-old girl and her mother.

"Mexico Prison Party Video Illustrates Lack of Control in Penitentiaries. A recently-released video recorded in a maximum-security prison in Mexico shows inmates throwing a party, serving as a reminder of the authority wielded by criminal groups in the country's penitentiaries. Mexican daily Milenio obtained a video of a party held in the maximum security prison of Puente Grande, in the state of Jalisco. The party was allegedly thrown by Jose Luis Gutierrez Valencia, better known as ""Don Chelo."" Don Chelo was arrested in January 2010 in Puerto Vallarta. At the time, authorities believed he was a member of the Sinaloa Cartel. But today, Don Chelo is suspected to control the Puente Grande penitentiary on behalf of the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion - CJNG). His daughter is the romantic partner of Ruben Oseguera, alias ""El Menchito,"" the son of CJNG founder and leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias ""El Mencho."" According to Milenio, the party took place sometime between December 2015 and March 2016. However, the video was only made public on May 9 this year. Don Chelo explicitly asked for the party to be filmed, so that he could later give copies of the footage to his guests. The video shows Don Chelo surrounded by his alleged bodyguards, while prisoners dance and drink around him. The party featured a concert by a band known as Los Buchones de Culiacan, who in between songs hailed the CJNG and Don Chelo. In a telling moment, Don Chelo says to his guests: ""I'm the one who rules here. Ask for what you want, I'll make you sure you'll have it."" (See video below) The video shot in Puente Grande is exemplary of the lack of control Mexican authorities have over the country's prisons, and the free reign inmates enjoy behind bars. This is all the more troubling in the case of Puente Grande. The prison is a maximum-security facility, where some of the most dangerous criminals, including perhaps most notably the former leader of the Juarez Cartel, Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, alias ""El Viceroy,"" are detained. The fact that prisoners are able to throw a party like Don Chelo's speaks volumes of the state's inability to control penitentiaries, even those meant to host some of the biggest underworld figures. Puente Grande has a rather infamous record. Indeed, legendary drug lord and former head of the Sinaloa Cartel Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias ""El Chapo,"" escaped from the penitentiary in 2001 with the help of a corrupt guard who ended up becoming one of his closest associates , Damaso Lopez Nunez, alias ""Licenciado."" (Licenciado was arrested in Mexico earlier this month.) While El Chapo was in prison, Licenciado allegedly helped him to create a riot squad known as ""the Sinaloans,"" and made sure the drug boss could easily bribe other officers. The fact that no prison guards can be seen in the footage of Don Chelo's party suggests that very little has changed after almost two decades."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Guatemala Cocaine Seizures Stable, but US Worried. Guatemalan cocaine seizures are on track to reach the same levels in 2013 as in 2012, but concerns remain over plans to nationalize Guatemala's counter-narcotics efforts. Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla told elPeriodico that drug seizures had dropped in 2013 compared with the past two years, and attributed this to increased controls forcing drug traffickers to move smaller quantities at a time. However, according to national police figures reported by elPeriodico, 2,236 kilos of cocaine were seized between January 1 and September 4 this year, compared to 3,292 kilos in 2012 -- a proportionally almost equal haul when the difference in time periods is taken into consideration. However, there has been a significant decrease in synthetic drug seizures in 2013 compared to 2012, with authorities recovering just five kilos of methamphetamines so far this year compared to more than two tons in 2012. The figures do not take into account the seizure of precursor chemicals, which rose signifcantly last year. Guatemala, along with the rest of Central America, is a major transshipment point for US-bound cocaine and a focus for US counter-narcotics operations in the region. Though the United States stopped military aid to Guatemala in 1990, it has continued to fund anti-drug efforts, and purchased helicopters for the country in 2007. Plans are currently underway to transfer seven helicopters used for anti-drug surveillance -- and until now maintained by the United States -- into the hands of the Guatemalan government. Guatemala's interior minister has declared the Guatemalan personnel that will fly the helicopters to be highly skilled, however US officials have in the past expressed concern to InSight Crime about handing the reins of anti-drug efforts over to the Guatemalan Air Force. Though Guatemalan Defense Minister Ulises Anzueto claimed last year that helicopter patrols had significantly reduced drug flights through the country, he also admitted 70 percent of drugs moving through Guatemala were trafficked via the country's coastline. This means the country will need to focus efforts on sea as well as air routes, something which could prove to be a budgetary strain.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Dominican Groups Eye Lucrative Patagonia Drug Market. A series of arrests of Dominican nationals in southern Argentina over recent months have highlighted a highly lucrative drug market in the area, where they can be sold for higher prices than in Buenos Aires. Authorities in the city of Las Heras, in the southern province of Santa Cruz, arrested three Dominican men on March 16 accused of leading a micro-trafficking organization, reported La Vanguardia Noticias. A day earlier, three men from the Dominican Republic and one Argentine national were detained in the city of Comodoro Rivadavia, in the province of Chubut, also accused of transporting drugs with intent to distribute. In September 2018, as a result of a nine-month-long investigation, federal police dismantled a group known as ""Banda del Caribe"" (Caribbean Gang). Four Dominicans and one Colombian were arrested while cash, mobile phones and ammunition were seized. They were accused of periodically transporting cocaine from Buenos Aires to various cities in the province of Santa Cruz. Dominican micro-trafficking crime groups might have found themselves a lucrative, and seemingly easy to tap into, market in the scenic cities of Argentina's Patagonia. According to an expert who spoke to InfoBae, a kilo of cocaine worth $10,000 in Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires, can be sold for $15,000 in any of the provinces in Patagonia. A gram of cocaine in Ushuaia or Rio Grande in Tierra del Fuego can sell for between 800 to 1,000 pesos (between around $20 and 25). In Buenos Aires, the price drops to between 300 to 500 pesos (around $7 and $12). The high markups are related to the costs involved in transporting products to these remote cities and a particularly growing market. Speaking at a press conference in the city of Trelew, Chubut, Argentina's Security Secretary, Eugenio Burzaco said that consumption of drugs per capita in the six provinces that make up Argentina's Patagonia (La Pampa, Neuquen, Rio Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz y Tierra del Fuego) is ""higher than the national average"" and growing. SEE MORE: Argentina News and Profile Experts claim the groups in charge of transporting the drugs in small quantities from Buenos Aires to Patagonia, mostly by bus, are becoming more sophisticated. While Dominican nationals are not the only ones involved in Argentina's growing microtrafficking problem, the string of arrests reported in recent months might suggest the groups they control are developing in size and reach, which has caused some confrontations between them. This has forced authorities to zoom into their activities. ""They are not large organizations, but mainly family clans: parents, children and cousins. Lately, we have also started noticing confrontations between groups of Dominicans caused by money that was not paid back or favors that were not returned,"" a judicial source told Infobae."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Brazil Sends 6,500 Troops to Secure Borders. The Brazilian Ministry of Defense has deployed 6,500 troops along its border with Paraguay, Bolivia and Peru in a huge operation aimed at combating drug trafficking and organized crime. In what has been described as "" the largest coordinated border action in its history "" Brazil's Army, Air Force and Navy will carry out operations ""Agata 3"" and ""Cadeado"" to counter various crimes along the more than 4,000-mile border with Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay. The troops will be supported by 57 aircraft and 10 warships. Soldiers will be deployed to the border states of Amazonas, Acre, Rondonia, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. The operations form part of a Strategic Border Plan launched by President Dilma Rousseff in June, which will see Brazil invest $6.3 billion over the next eight years to strengthen border defense. Rousseff has said increasing security along Brazil's borders is her government's number one security priority. Paraguayan officials have protested against the neighboring country's military operations along the border, from where drugs, weapons, and contraband goods are smuggled into Brazil, often by Brazil-based criminal networks. On 31 October, Brazil's Defense Minister, Celso Amorim, signed a ""Memorandum of Understanding"" in La Paz with his Bolivian counterpart, Ruben Saavedra, with the aim of developing joint military operations along 3,000-mile border shared by the two nations in 2012. MercoPress news agency reported that Brazilian forces have seized 62 tons of narcotics and made 3,000 arrests since the border security plan was approved, while over 650 tons of weapons and explosives have been seized, according to Rousseff.

"El Salvador FMLN Leader Investigated for Drug Trafficking. El Salvador's attorney general has opened an investigation to determine whether Jose Luis Merino, one of the three chief leaders of the ruling FMLN party, is involved in drug and weapons trafficking. Merino is a member of the political commission of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional - FMLN) and a congressman in the Central American Parliament. He has been one of the financial brains of the former guerrilla army turned political party since the end of El Salvador's 12-year civil war in 1992. Attorney General Douglas Melendez said he has reopened an old investigation of Merino and will add to it accusations made by US Senator Marco Rubio in a June 29 hearing. ""You've got the right hand man of the president of El Salvador, Jose Luis Merino. This guy is a top-notch, world class money launderer, arms smuggler for the FARC as well as corrupt Venezuelan officials,"" Rubio said during a hearing on global corruption at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Why is this guy not sanctioned?"" The FMLN was quick to dismiss Rubio's accusations in a press statement that characterized the senator as a ""political loser"" mounting a politically-motivated attack. The attorney general, however, said he was looking into it. ""There is an investigation of events related to Mr. Merino that was opened in 2014,"" Melendez told reporters in El Salvador, adding that it was ""related to the issue of drugs and weapons."" ""We are going to review that information and pick it up,"" Melendez said. A source in Melendez's office told InSight Crime that the attorney general has asked his staff to review the old accusations and include them in a new file that he decided to open after hearing Rubio's statement. ""He has asked for everything we have on Merino, and will go on from there,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""Given these statements from a public official of another country, and given that they are addressing a politician and public official of our country, we can't not investigate,"" Melendez told reporters. The pre-existing investigative file was opened in 2014 by the attorney general at that time, Luis Martinez, after Spanish newspaper ABC published a story alleging that one of Merino's staffers had made contact with officials of President Nicolas Maduro's administration in Venezuela to arrange flights presumably carrying illegal drugs. Melendez's staff said former attorney general Martinez failed to advance with that investigation. The ABC story, based partly on US sources, said that in 2011 one of Merino's deputies asked Maduro's secretary to expedite flying permits for an airplane bearing the US registration N769M, owned by Execuflight, a company linked to Salvadoran businessman Enrique Rais. Venezuelan sources told InSight Crime that N769M had asked permission at least twice to fly over Apure, an area signaled by the US State Department as a cocaine hub. Insight Crime Analysis This is not the first time Jose Luis Merino, alias ""Comandante Ramiro Vasquez,"" has been mentioned in connection with drug crimes. In 2008, Colombian officials reported emails from Merino showed up on the laptop of slain guerrilla commander Raul Reyes, of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia FARC). Reyes was killed in a Colombian air strike and assault on a guerrilla camp across the border in Ecuador. The recovered emails linked Reyes and the FARC to Venezuelan officials and others, including Merino. Merino's name appeared in several emails related to an arms trafficking operation. El Salvador also opened an investigation, but -- as with the 2014 investigation -- it never advanced. Merino and the FMLN have consistently dismissed the accusations as politically-motivated attacks fabricated by right-wing opponents and the media. US law enforcement officers told InSight Crime that Merino has been a person of interest for Washington for almost a decade now. ""He has been there long enough,"" said an official, who asked not to be named due to lack of authorization to speak publicly. The file that Melendez is opening now will be at least the fourth investigation in which Jose Luis Merino's name is included. None of the previous investigators pursued drug and weapons trafficking allegations, and to have a Salvadoran attorney general say he is investigating the FMLN strongman for those alleged crimes is unprecedented.

"How Central Americas Crime Wave Has Spared Nicaragua, So Far. Nicaragua, along with its neighbors Panama and Costa Rica, is often described as a country that dodged the wave of organized crime violence swamping Central America, but that could be about to change. The numbers are clear; Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, the three nations in the ""Northern Triangle,"" all had murder rates of more than 40 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010, with Honduras on course for a staggeringly high rate of 86 per 100,000 this year. Meanwhile the three countries to the south all kept their rates below 25. Nicaragua, despite being the poorest nation in the isthmus, has one of the lowest murder rates, at 14. Many theories put forward to explain this revolve around the work of the authorities to stop youth gangs forming and becoming violent. This is attributed to the legacy of socialist structures put in place during the Sandinista revolution , with ""neighborhood watch"" organizations that still persist today, and community-based police forces focused on crime prevention. Nicaragua does not have a significant presence of the biggest, and most notorious, Central American gangs -- the Mara Salvatrucha 13, or MS-13 , and Barrio 18 , or M-18. These both have many members in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, as well as in the U.S. Part of the reason for their presence in these countries, not in Nicaragua (or its neighbors in the southern part of the isthmus), is migration patterns. Large numbers of people emigrated from the Northern Triangle countries to the U.S. in the 1980s and 1990s, often settling in Los Angeles. Here, some young people formed self-protection gangs, which morphed over time into large-scale criminal organizations like MS-13 and M-18. These structures were exported to the northern half of Central America in the 1990s, via the U.S. policy of deporting convicted gang members after they had served terms in prison. With Nicaragua, on the other hand, large numbers of emigrants opted for Costa Rica, while those who moved to the U.S. tended to settle in Miami, which did not have L.A.'s pervasive gang culture. These social factors go a long way towards explaining why Nicaragua has less violence than the Northern Triangle. However, youth gangs do exist in Nicaragua, particularly in urban areas, with some estimating that there are up to 25,000 gang members in the country. A more crucial difference may be in their type -- they tend to be smaller scale and locally based, without links to groups in other parts of the country, and much less to foreign groups. They generallly lack close links with the Central American ""maras,"" like MS-13 and M-18, but more importantly they do not have ties to international drug trafficking organizations. As USAID puts it ""For the most part, gangs in Nicaragua are small youth gangs that are territorial in nature, concerned with wealth accumulation, and involved in petty crime."" Besides the social factors, one reason for this is the work of the Nicaraguan police to keep out foreign groups James Bosworth, of Bloggings by Boz , highlights the absence of the Zetas as a major contributor to Nicaragua's relative peace. The Zetas, who first sprung up as the armed wing of Mexico's Gulf Cartel , have since become independent and moved much of their operations into Guatemala, especially since 2008. (See InSight Crime's special on the Zetas in Guatemala ). Going south brings the group a step closer to South America -- the source of drugs -- giving them greater control over the supply chain, and a bigger share of the profits. Meanwhile, Guatemala's weaker government and more permissive environment allows them to operate with greater impunity. The Zetas have also begun to establish links in El Salvador, prompting President Mauricio Funes to warn last year that the group had sent exploratory missions into the country to seek links with local trafficking groups. The group's presence is stronger in Honduras, where they have been ramping up operations since 2006, and now control an increasing amount of the cocaine trade through that country, managing the local traffickers, according to a report from the Wilson Center. The Honduran government has said that the Zetas are working with the Honduran branches of Barrio 18. Nicaragua would be the logical next stop on the Zetas' journey south. The group pose a great danger to the countries they occupy because they tend to employ a ""take no prisoners"" mode of operating, preferring violence and territorial domination to forming links and alliances with existing groups. The big drug cartels do business in Nicaragua, and drugs have been transported in large quantities from South to North America via Nicaragua, particularly the Caribbean coastline, for at least three decades. However, the country has had its own traffickers that handle this business, generally working under orders of foreign groups. Nicaraguan authorities have reported the capture of Zetas members in the country within the last two years, but its not clear how far these were really integral members of the organization. Up to this point, transnational groups have not had a good reason to set up shop in Nicaragua. The country is small and, as InSight Crime has noted , has tended to be a territory that drug shipments pass straight through, rather than being stockpiled or changing hands. Nicaragua's poverty may even be a factor saving it from penetration by international drug cartels; security expert and former police chief Francisco Bautista told IPS that, ""Our economy represents a mere six percent of Central America's GDP, and this is not of strategic interest for organised crime, which is used to moving money around in strong economies where they can camouflage money laundering and weapons purchases."" According to some analysts, this could be changing. For Monica Zalaquett, head of Managua-based NGO CEPREV , Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama still have less violence than their northern counterparts, but they are on the same path. ""What is really important is not that Nicaragua has less violence than its neigbors to the north, but that it has more than in previous years,"" she said in a recent interview with El Faro. The Nicaraguan Instituto de Estudios Estrategicos y Politicas Publicas (IEEPP) warned last year that organized crime is beginning to sink its claws into the country; ""organized crime is established, it already has logistical networks, support networks, that are penetrating institutions or exploring."" The think tank highlighted a growing presence of Mexican cartels, which it said was encouraging the growth of local trafficking structures. The Zetas are an expansionist group, and are present over Nicaragua's northern border in Honduras. If and when they decide to move into Nicaragua, the security situation could rapidly grow worse.

"Reports of Narco-Controlled Towns Shake Mexico. Reports of drug traffickers taking control of towns in northwestern Mexico is a reminder of how organized crime often seeks power at the municipal government level. Criminals have taken near total control of Madera, a town in the northern border state of Chihuahua, reporter Dora Villalobos told local media. The town sees two to three murders per week and residents are often subjected to kidnapping and extortion, she added. In another Chihuahua town, Las Chinacas, some 300 families have fled their homes after being threatened by a caravan of armed men, reported La Opcion. Meanwhile in nearby Sinaloa state, Santiago Chaidez Jimenez is known as the ""narco-mayor"" of Canelas, where he allegedly directs a group of hitmen who kill political rivals and those who fail to make extortion payments, according to El Diario. It is noteworthy that these recent reports involve towns with little or no support from Mexico's central government. Madera has no permanent federal or state presence, Villalobos was reported as saying, while Las Chinacas and Canelas are both isolated mountain towns. Organized crime's influence can most often be felt at this level, where officials are seen as more vulnerable to receiving both bribes and threats. The ongoing killing of mayors in Mexico speaks to this grim reality, as do the spikes in violence that often precede local elections. Making matters worse, municipal-level police are often poorly paid , making it easier for criminals to subvert what little security apparatus a town may have. President Enrique Pena Nieto's "" mando unico "" initiative seeks to address municipal level police corruption by consolidating local police under state command. However, there are indications state police agencies are no less prone to corruption than their municipal counterparts. This dynamic is certainly not unique to Mexico. In Central America's Northern Triangle region (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras), criminal groups often fill the power vacuum in areas with a weak state presence ( pdf ), especially in border regions where drugs, weapons, and other contraband products flow freely."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Mexico Links Ex-Tijuana Mayor to Murder Weapons. Mexico's authorities have linked two weapons allegedly found in the possession of former Tijuana Mayor Jorge Hank Rhon to homicide cases. According to Mexico's Justice Department, the weapons were used in the 2010 murder of a car dealer and the 2009 killing of a bodyguard, both in Tijuana. According to the Associated Press , at least one of the weapons has Hank Rhon's name emblazoned on the barrel. Hank Rhon, the scion of one of Mexico's most famous political families and the owner of one of the nation's largest casino chains, was arrested in Tijuana earlier this month , and charged with possession of illegal military-grade weapons. He remains under investigation for links to organized crime, and the state of Baja California Norte, where Tijuana is located, will decide whether to pursue charges related to the murders. Hank Rhon's name has been connected to homicides in the past; his chief bodyguard, Antonio Vera, was convicted of the 1988 murder of journalist Hector Felix Miranda, who had criticized Hank Rhon in his writing. The former official has never previously been charged with a crime and denies all of the current accusations, but he has long been accused of links to the Arellano Felix clan, also known as the Tijuana Cartel , for years the dominant force in that city's underworld. 	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
"Colombian Coyotes Smuggled South Asian Migrants. Authorities in Colombia have broken up a human smuggling ring that transported Nepalese and Bangladeshi migrants into Central America, highlighting the apparent growth in illegal South Asian migrants passing through Latin America on their way northwards. The operation was discovered after investigators from Colombia's Attorney General's Office uncovered nine migrants -- most from Nepal or Bangladesh -- hidden in a house in the Caribbean coastal city of Turbo. The investigation led to the arrest of 18 people, reported El Tiempo. It is thought the migrants were most likely on their way to the United States, via Central America and Mexico. Turbo is close to the Darien Gap, a treacherous jungle region between Colombia and Panama, which has emerged as a popular route with migrants due to the lack of state presence. News of South Asian migrants passing through Colombia is not new; reports have been increasingly commonplace in local media in recent years, with a recent investigation by El Tiempo highlighting the ""wave"" of South Asians using the Darien to evade the authorities. Yet passing through this inhospitable jungle zone carries its own risks. The area is a guerrilla stronghold and extremely difficult to navigate. The Colombian Army has stated that the 57 th Front of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which dominates the region, is charging migrants money to pass through and may be guiding them on their journey. According to the El Tiempo investigation, South Asian migrants often arrive in Brazil, where they do not require a visa, before passing through either Venezuela or Ecuador. Due to the challenging terrain they must pass through to arrive in Colombia undetected, migrants often rely on ""coyotes"" -- people who charge thousands of dollars to act as guides. Cubans still make up the largest illegal migrant group passing through Colombia, representing 45 percent of the 1,079 migrants detained by immigration authorities over thel last 18 months. However, the influx of South Asians is a rising phenomenon, with El Tiempo reporting the discovery of 27 Nepalese and 19 Bangladeshis in the first four months of this year, compared to 49 and 30 respectively for the entire of 2012."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mapping of Colombia Homicide Data Reflects Regional Dynamics. A new report by a leading Colombian think tank maps the concentration of homicides in the country's largest cities, highlighting the importance of urban areas in violence reduction strategies, both in Colombia and across Latin America. The report by the Ideas for Peace Foundation (Fundacion Ideas para la Paz - FIP), published in El Espectador , found that the 27 most populated cities in Colombia accounted for 48 percent of the country's total homicides in 2016. Thirty percent of all homicides occurred the country's four largest cities: Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and Barranquilla. The impact these four cities have on the national homicide rate can be seen in the graphic below. For each decrease in the average homicide rate of the four cities in each of the last five years, there has been a corresponding decline in the national homicide rate. ""If the country wants to continue reducing the homicide rate, it will have to have a concrete response to urban violence,"" the authors write. FIP identified Medellin as one of the cities most responsible for driving down the country's murder tallies. The homicide rate in Colombia's second-biggest city went from double the national average to more than 6 points below it in the span of just four years, a stunning turnaround for a city that was once the murder capital of the world. FIP also mapped where murders are concentrated in each of the four principal cities. It found that homicides in Cali are generally highest in areas where illicit markets exist and criminal organizations are fighting for control of territory. Similarly, high levels of violence in the national capital Bogota have a strong correlation with drug sales. To visualize the concentration of homicides in certain areas, FIP compared a map of Cali in which last year's homicides were distributed at random with another map of where they actually occurred. On the actual map, homicides are clustered in the eastern half of Cali and a few pockets along the city's western limits. These areas are also where the state is weakest, the poverty rate is highest and the greatest number of people live, according to FIP. Based on this data, FIP argues that the authorities should focus their efforts and resources on reducing violence in these micro-areas where homicides are most concentrated. ""In order to stop the current violence it is necessary to move from a general point of view at the national level to implementing specific measures at the local level,"" the authors conclude. The FIP's findings are largely a microcosm of the security dynamics in the rest of Latin America. Robert Muggah, research director at the Brazil-based Igarape Institute, has said the region's ""turbo-urbanization"" has put cities on the frontlines in the unceasing battle to reduce violence. And as citizens continue to move from rural to urban settings, the importance of cities to countries' overall security will only increase. It is estimated that 87 percent of all residents in Latin America will be living in cities by 2050. As in Colombia, urban violence across the region is geographically concentrated. According to Igarape, approximately 80 percent of all homicides in Latin America's large and medium-sized cities occur on just 2 percent of city streets. So in order for Latin America to shed its dubious distinction as the world's most violent region , it will have to prioritize not just cities but the small, hyper-violent pockets where the vast majority of homicides take place. The good news is that some cities are already taking innovative steps to improving security. A former mayor of Cali used an epidemiological approach to curb violence in the 1990s. In Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, authorities established a range of social programs, including working groups known as ""security roundtables"" (mesas de seguridad) that involved community leaders in the decision-making process. Considered to be the world's murder capital just five years ago, Juarez's homicide rate has since dropped precipitously. Of course, criminal actors also play a major role in determining homicide rates. Medellin's murder rate fell when a ""pax mafioso"" was agreed upon by the city's two major crime groups. And Juarez's security improvements coincided with the end of a bloody cartel war. In El Salvador, the national homicide rate was cut by half in the months after the MS13 and Barrio 18 gangs agreed to a government-facilitated truce in 2012. As InSight Crime has previously noted , the presence of organized crime may be the single biggest obstacle to implementing security strategies that prioritize populations and places that are prone to high levels of violence. These types of interventions have been found to be effective in the United States, but it's not yet clear how they well they could be adapted to the Latin American context. What is clear is that countries in Latin America must place a greater emphasis on collecting homicide data. Few security interventions are evaluated in a scientifically rigorous manner. Even worse, a recent InSight Crime investigation found that law enforcement officers in Guatemala are often forced to rely on a sixth-sense known as ""olfato"" to determine who is behind a murder. Without accurate and robust data, authorities have little recourse for diagnosing the problem and applying appropriate measures to reduce violence."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Veracruz Dismisses 1,000s of Police in Attempt to Break Zetas Ties. During the past three years the state of Veracruz in Mexico has removed 3,500 police officers from duty, a result of extensive efforts to destroy deep running ties between police and organized crime. Of the thousands of police dismissed, 37 Veracruz officers are now facing trial over alleged ties to organized crime, reported La Jornada. Veracruz's Secretary of Public Security (SSP), Arturo Bermudez Zurita, said that previously the Veracruz police ""served other interests,"" such as ""organized crime, namely the Gulf Cartel, Jalisco Cartel, or the Zetas."" Now, he said, ""there is a different climate, of much better security, that we have created."" Bermudez said of the dismissed officers that authorities know, ""Who they are, where they are, and what they are doing,"" and made assurances the work of agents under his command would be transparent. The secretary also acknowledged that kidnappings, extortion, and cattle rustling frequently occur in Veracruz, but said incidences of these crimes are decreasing -- although he offered no figures to support the claim. Although Veracruz has historically not been one of Mexico's most violent states , its long coastline makes it an attractive proposition to drug cartels, which have long controlled territory there with the aid of corrupt police and officials. Once dominated by the Gulf Cartel, the state later became the domain of the cartel's breakaway armed wing, the Zetas. In 2011, then President Felipe Calderon said Veracruz had ""been left in the hands of the Zetas."" Zetas infiltration of the police became so pervasive that in 2011 government officials dismissed 980 Veracruz state police as well as the entire police force in the city of Veracruz , some 800 officers and 300 administrative staff. Since that time the Mexican government has made attempts at police reform, subjecting officers to confidence tests, which include polygraph and drug tests. Despite reforms, however, the recent implication of Veracruz police in the killing of a Mexican singer shows how even vetting procedures that have removed thousands of officers have not entirely succeeded in weeding out corruption. A further possible side effect of removing so many corrupt officers is that this may be providing the cartels with a large pool of professionally trained recruits."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Perus Most Wanted Deported From Colombia. One of Peru's most-wanted men has been captured in Colombia and deported marking a leap forward in a high profile case against a powerful criminal network with links to land trafficking, money laundering and the drug trade. Rodolfo Orellana, alias ""El Gordo,"" a Peruvian lawyer and businessman who had been on the run for months, was captured in the southwest Colombian city of Cali on November 13 by Colombia's investigative police (DIJIN), with the help of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). After his capture, he was transported to Bogota and swiftly deported back to Peru. According to Colombia's presidential website , Orellana had entered Colombia about two months before his capture and was being protected by ""friends and contacts"" there, including ""family members of a murdered Valle del Cauca drug trafficker."" At the time of his arrest, Orellana was wanted by international police body Interpol for money laundering and illicit association, and was reportedly processing fake documents with the goal of escaping to Sweden. Together with his sister Ludith -- who was captured on the same day just north of Lima -- Orellana allegedly ran a massive criminal network that included lawyers, members of the Peruvian judiciary and police, politicians and other public sector employees. He is thought to have amassed a fortune of around $100 million via the fraudulent seizure and resale of properties belonging to individuals and the state , and to have created some 50 front companies to launder illicitly conceived money. Case prosecutor Marita Barreto told Peru 21 that Orellana was also being investigated for drug ties. Given Orellana's extensive network and penetration of state institutions -- as well as his apparent international contacts -- his capture is an important victory for the Peruvian authorities, and is likely to have some members of Peru's political elite running scared. Legal sources in Peru had previously told InSight Crime that they were preparing 50 cases against members of Orellana's network -- out of a total of 200 suspected members they had identified -- making this one of the most extensive cases ever built against one group in Peru. Orellana's capture comes shortly after the late October arrest of one of his alleged top operators, retired Police Colonel Benedicto Jimenez, who was formerly considered a hero in the war against the country's Shining Path guerrillas. Orellana's choice to flee to Colombia indicates he felt the political protection he had enjoyed was crumbling, though it is interesting that he was willing to take his chances in a country that has in recent years placed considerable emphasis on taking down criminal kingpins."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"US State Dept to Create Central America Corruption Blacklist. On July 26, the US House and Senate approved a bill that will require the Secretary of State to share the identities of government officials in Central America's Northern Triangle countries who are involved in corruption and drug trafficking with Congress. The bill specifies that the secretary must submit a report that includes ""the names of senior government officials in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador who are known to have committed or facilitated acts of grand corruption or narcotics trafficking."" This week's vote ended in favor of modifying an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) originally introduced by Representative Norma Torres (D-CA), which was approved by the House of Representatives in May. In the first version, the Pentagon and the Director of National Intelligence were to deliver the information required by the amendment to Congress, but the modification shifts that responsibility to the Secretary of State. The bill requires the Secretary of State, in coordination with his counterpart at the Defense Department, to present three lists of names to the appropriations, foreign relations and defense committees of both congressional chambers. The lists are to be part of a report on ""narcotics trafficking, corruption and illicit campaign finance"" in the three countries that make up the Northern Triangle region of Central America: Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. The state and defense secretaries will be required to list, for example, the individuals who have donated to political campaigns in the Northern Triangle ""with the proceeds of narco-trafficking or other illicit activities"" over the past two years. They will also have to list the political candidates who have received such funds as campaign donations. The congressional committees must receive the report within 180 days of the amendment's publication. Given that negotiators from both the House and Senate have now agreed to the amendment this week, and that a legislative official with first-hand knowledge of conversations about this bill said it could be enacted this September, the first report could be expected in Congress by the end of 2018. ""The expectation is that both chambers [of Congress] will pass the bill in the coming days and will send it on to the president's desk. Once the president signs it, the Secretary of State will be required by law to produce the report,"" another legislative source in Washington told InSight Crime. If the bill becomes law, which seems likely, it will create an uncomfortable situation for many Northern Triangle politicians who have been haunted by corruption, illicit campaign financing and even drug trafficking. The lists the law will require could include presidents, ministers and legislators. If the US government complies with the approved amendment once it is enacted, the first of the three required lists the Secretary of State will produce could theoretically feature names like that of Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales. The Attorney General's Office of Guatemala has accused Morales of participating in an illicit campaign financing scheme during his 2015 bid for president. In Honduras, President Juan Orlando Hernandez admitted that during his first term, from 2014 to 2018, his political party received funds from supposed acts of corruption in his country's social security system. At least part of that money was allegedly used to finance his election campaign. Meanwhile, El Salvador's three most recent presidents have either been investigated, convicted or jailed for possible acts of corruption. In the cases of Antonio Saca and Mauricio Funes , the investigations have expanded to include charges against dozens of collaborators and former government officials for crimes such as corruption, illicit enrichment and even money laundering. These political leaders and others could appear on the lists. When it comes to Guatemala and Honduras, however, the US government's position has been ambivalent at best. Washington has admittedly been tough on businesspeople and lower-level politicians involved in financing political campaigns with potentially illegal funds. But it seems to be significantly more lenient in dealing with heads of state such as Morales and Hernandez, whom it considers regional allies. While the sitting presidents go unpunished, in Guatemala, the US embassy has focused on withdrawing the visas of dozens of people, among them government officials and private campaign financers, for suspected crimes or acts of corruption. And in Honduras, the US diplomatic representatives in Tegucigalpa did not hesitate to congratulate Honduran authorities for the Pandora Case that accuses former government officials and legislators of fraud, corruption, illicit enrichment and money laundering. A blacklist like the one proposed by US Congress could have important consequences for anti-graft efforts in Central America's Northern Triangle. But it remains to be seen how the United States' political and diplomatic priorities in the region will affect whose names are added."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Jail Time for LatAm Officials Wont Kick FIFA Corruption Problem. Authorities in the United States have sentenced two high-level soccer officials to jail time in relation to a widespread corruption scandal involving the world's biggest soccer association FIFA, but rooting out rampant corruption within the institution is likely still far off. A US federal court on August 29 sentenced Juan Angel Napout, the former president of Paraguay's soccer federation who was also formerly the head of South America's main soccer governing body, known as CONMEBOL, to nine years in jail and ordered him to forfeit $3.37 million and pay a $1 million fine, the BBC reported. Napout's sentence comes shortly after the sentencing earlier this month of Jose Maria Marin, the former president of Brazil's soccer federation, to four years in jail. Marin became the first to be sentenced in the corruption investigation. He was also ordered to forfeit $3.34 million and pay a $1.2 million fine, according to The Guardian. ""You have to send a message that this behavior results in severe consequences. You cannot steal millions in bribes from these organizations without punishment,"" federal Judge Pamela Chen is reported to have said during Napout's sentencing. Marin and Napout were both convicted of participating in a multimillion-dollar bribery and kickback scheme within the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), the primary body governing soccer at the global level. The trial against these and other Latin American officials first kicked off in November 2017. Authorities have charged 42 individuals in total for their alleged involvement in different bribery and influence peddling schemes, among other things, that took place across the region over the course of two decades. Two Latin American media giants -- Mexico's Televisa and Brazil's Globo -- have also been implicated in the investigation for allegedly paying multimillion-dollar bribes to FIFA executives in order to secure media rights for the 2026 and 2030 World Cup tournaments. The recent sentencing of two former high-level soccer executives to jail time in relation to the far-reaching FIFA corruption investigation is indeed a positive development in the case, but it likely won't rid the institution of the rampant corruption that has come to define it. Organized crime has for years had a close relationship with soccer in Latin America, from match fixing and criminalized soccer fan clubs to criminal groups using the sport as a means to launder money and build social capital. The FIFA corruption investigation also unveiled the many ways in which elite officials within soccer's main governing body create various schemes to line their own pockets. While jail time is certainly a necessary development, journalist Ken Bensinger, the author of ""Red Card: How the U.S. Blew the Whistle on the World's Biggest Sports Scandal,"" recently told InSight Crime that FIFA has not gone far enough to address the institution's corruption problem. ""I think it's folly to expect that by arresting a bunch of people you solve the cultural problems of the institutions,"" he said. ""This is sort of the splash of cold water on the face, but what has to come next is the hard work of really creating a new, less corrupt culture."" Also, FIFA is a non-profit association registered in Switzerland, where there are intentionally weak laws governing non-profits. So while action by US authorities against some of the organization's corrupt actors is important, action from Swiss and international authorities is ""essential to reining in the 'cesspit of corruption' at the world's most popular sport,"" Bruce W. Bean from Michigan State University argued in a recent paper ."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Gangs Unable to Enforce Truce in Eastern El Salvador. El Salvador authorities admit the nationwide gang truce is not working in certain parts of the country, with 31 murders registered in one municipality since the beginning of the year. Gang violence, cut dramatically in most of El Salvador since the country's biggest street gangs committed to a peace deal in March 2012, is still going strong in La Union , a town near the Honduran border in a department with the same name. In a statement, Security and Justice Minister David Munguia Payes implied that gangs the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 were having difficulty in controlling sub-factions, known as ""clicas,"" in the region, who are not following the truce. There have also been reports of increased extortion in La Union, while buses transporting employees of private companies have now stopped entering certain neighborhoods because of threats issued to drivers. According to Munguia Payes, La Union's police chief recently said that the truce was not in operation in the area, while the mayor acknowledged there had been many murders despite the peace deal. The security issues in La Union raise questions about the ability of the MS-13 and Barrio 18 to continue enforcing the truce on a nationwide scale. The MS-13 and Barrio 18 leadership obviously had the authority to force many ""clicas"" to fall in line, following the negotiation of the truce in March 2012 -- as evidenced by the significant drop in murders that followed. However, as pointed out in a recent report by the International Assessment and Strategy Center (IASC), there are some indications of growing tensions between the Maras' top leadership and the clicas, a relationship that could deteriorate further if the clicas no longer believe the truce is in their best interests. There could be other explanations for why the truce is apparently not being respected in La Union. The area is home to another major drug trafficking organization, the Perrones , which has been growing in strength in recent years. The group has traditionally controlled the border provinces of La Union and San Miguel, moving cocaine shipments into Honduras. There have been some reports of the MS-13 working in the international drug trade in this region, which could give them special incentive to ignore the mandates of the truce, which ask the clicas to cease all illicit activities. The recent murders in La Union could also be indicative of a turf war between the MS-13 and the Perrones, who have little obligation to respect each others' territory."	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
"Drug Fight Builds US-Cuba Bridges. Fighting drug trafficking is one of the few issues where the US and Cuba actually collaborate, albeit on a small scale, though the true extent of drug smuggling on the island remains shrouded in mystery. At a Senate hearing on international drug trafficking this week, lawmakers voiced concerns about the potential for Cuba to become a major transit point for drugs into the US. While discussing a surge in drug smuggling through the Caribbean, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) warned that the island could turn into an important distribution platform for traffickers. Since the 1959 revolution, Cuba has presented itself as taking a tough stance on organized crime, in part in response to the fact that, under the Batista regime, the country was known as a haven for mob activity. During the latest meeting of the Communist Party Congress, President Raul Castro issued a sharp critique of corruption on the island, calling it "" one of the main enemies of the revolution ."" It is likely that the kind of corruption Castro was referring to relates to bribery and embezzlement rather than collusion with drug traffickers. The most recent high profile corruption case in the country, for instance, involved a former minister who was convicted of accepting bribes from a Chilean businessman. But the country has not been immune from the international drug trade. In 1989, General Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, who fought alongside Fidel Castro during the revolution, was executed along with three other military officers for their roles in a multi-million dollar cocaine smuggling ring linked to Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel. Nine years later, in 1998, Colombian officials intercepted a 7.2 ton shipment of cocaine bound for Cuba. According to anonymous Colombian law enforcement authority cited by the Miami Herald at the time, the large size of the shipment suggested that the route had been used before. ""No one dares to send seven tons at one blow unless they've tested the route,"" said the official. Since these incidents, there has been evidence to suggest that drug trafficking is on the rise on the island, fueled by a small but growing domestic market. Cuba first acknowledged the existence of this consumption in January 2003, and promised that there would be ""no impunity"" for anyone caught trafficking illicit substances. Even with the resulting crackdown, the flow of drugs into the country appears to be increasing. The government recently announced that they had seized nine tons of drugs in 2011, three times more than in 2010. The majority of this was reportedly marijuana, with only a small percentage of cocaine and hashish. The site of much of this drug traffic is the rural southeast province of Holguin. In 2005, the head of Cuba's border security ministry told foreign press that Holguin is ""the region of Cuba most affected by drug trafficking."" Since then the area has become more popular with foreign tourists, providing both an increased market for drugs and a ready supply of potential smugglers. Ultimately, it should be noted that the amount of drugs that pass through Cuba on their way to the United States pales in comparison to the country's Caribbean neighbors, such as Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. For one thing, the 50-year-old embargo makes it very difficult for drug smugglers to bring their product into the US. Additionally, drug trafficking is one of the rare issues in which Cuban and American officials cooperate. As InSight Crime has reported , the US Interests Section in Havana has a Coast Guard representative in Havana, and leaked diplomatic cables reveal a level of engagement between the official and his counterparts in the Cuban Ministry of Interior (MININT) on the issue of drug flights from Jamaica. This cooperation seems to be having an effect on US-Cuba relations, at least as they relate to crime. While State Department officials under President Ronald Reagan publicly accused Fidel Castro of attempting to traffic drugs in order to boost the Cuban economy , the State Department's 2011 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) acknowledges that the Cuban authorities have made major inroads against the drug trade. In a rare note of praise for the Castro government, it notes that ""Cuba's counternarcotics efforts have prevented illegal narcotics trafficking from having a significant impact on the island.""

"Honduran Police Responsible for 149 Deaths in 2 Years: Report. A new report shows 149 people have died at the hands of the Honduran police in the last 23 months, highlighting the urgent need for reform efforts, which are currently being challenged by the Supreme Court. The report, released on December 1, was compiled by the Violence Observatory at the National Autonomous University of Honduras and implicated police officials from commissioners to agents, according to La Prensa. The majority of the victims were aged between 24 and 34 years old, the Observatory found. The report comes less than a week after the Constitutional Branch of the Honduran Supreme Court declared a police cleanup law unconstitutional. The law, which went into force June 2012, forced police officers to undergo a series of confidence tests -- including lie detector and drugs tests -- and allowed for their dismissal if they failed. The court ruled against the law as it did not offer accused officers the recourse to appeal. However, as the decision was not unanimous, the case will now pass to the full Supreme Court. Julieta Castellanos, the president of the National Autonomous University, presented the report and used the release to call on the court to reverse the decision. ""We want those who oppose the cleanup law to explain to us what right they have to make these decisions while the country's citizens are defenseless,"" she said. Four police officers were charged with the murder of Castellanos' son and a friend in October 2011. The Constitutional Branch's ruling dismissing the cleanup law was based on valid concerns, especially given allegations that the law was being used by high-ranking police chiefs to remove political rivals and personal enemies rather than removing corrupt elements in earnest. However, the new report once again underscores the dire state of the Honduran police force -- widely renowned as one of the most corrupt police forces in the region and has deep ties to organized crime -- and the urgency with which reform measures should be undertaken. If the full Supreme Court upholds the ruling against the cleanup law, it is uncertain how the state would proceed with any future purge measures. For now, President Porfirio Lobo has declared that reforms will continue despite the ruling, calling the institution an ""enemy"" of Honduras, reported La Tribuna ."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Historic Costa Rica Cocaine Seizure Highlights Role of Locals in Drug Trade. Costa Rica has intercepted over four tons of cocaine and detained 11 Costa Ricans, in a case providing one indication of deepening local involvement in drug trafficking through the country. According to Public Security Minister Celso Gamboa, the Costa Rican Coast Guard seized approximately 4.1 tons of cocaine during three separate operations off the Pacific Coast between June 10 and June 11, all of which was found on Costa Rican fishing boats, reported The Tico Times. The seizure was reportedly the largest in the country's history. Costa Rica's Vice Minister of Public Security, Gustavo Mata, said the profile of the 11 alleged traffickers was ""very young people with no criminal record."" He added that youth in the area had largely abandoned the traditional fishing industry in favor of drug trafficking, reported Reuters. The seizure came days after Costa Rica's Legislative Assembly agreed to extend joint maritime patrols with the US Coast Guard until the end of the year, a measure aimed at combating drug trafficking. For years, Costa Rica has served as a meeting point for Colombian and Mexican cartels transporting drug shipments, a role facilitated by its strategic position between the two countries. More recently, however, the country has become a storage center for the product, and cocaine seizures in the country have more than doubled since 2011. Between 2006 and 2010, the number of international drug trafficking operations dismantled in Costa Rica rose from seven to 16. Various foreign criminal organizations have been reported to operate there, including Mexico's Knights Templar and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). SEE ALSO : Coverage of Costa Rica The number of local Costa Rican groups dismantled has followed a similar trend, also more than doubling in the 2006-2010 period. Meanwhile, a high percentage of drug-related arrests last year, coupled with the disbanding of what was reportedly Costa Rica's first transnational drug trafficking group , suggest that Costa Ricans are becoming more deeply involved in the cocaine trade, likely developing independent structures to move cocaine for larger groups. According to The Tico Times, Costa Rican fishermen have been caught with nearly three tons of cocaine in 2014, and are increasingly taking on roles in large-scale operations, while the size of the most recent shipments indicates the suspects were using a tried and true drug route. The evolution of the drug trade in Costa Rica is facilitated by the fact that the country is ill-equipped to combat this increasing narco-activity , relying in some cases on US assistance ."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Honduras Destroyed up to 80 Narco Airstrips in 2012. The Honduran military will reportedly make the destruction of illegal airstrips used for drug trafficking flights a priority for 2013, a crucial step in cutting the principal air bridge for cocaine arriving from South America. The head of the armed forces, General Rene Osorio Canales, told national newspaper El Heraldo that the destruction of illegal airstrips was now a military priority and that they expect to identify and stop more suspected drug flights in 2013. This will be thanks in no small part to the restarting of a radar intelligence sharing program with the US. The US temporarily suspended sharing radar intelligence with Honduras for a three-month period last year, after Honduras shot down two suspect aircraft. General Osorio said that the armed forces will focus their efforts on identifying and destroying airstrips in the provinces of Yoro and Colon, near Honduras' Atlantic Coast. Colon is one of the country's most troubled regions: the government deployed a special military-police task force there last year , charged with improving security. Last year the military destroyed between 70 and 80 air strips across the country. Asides from the destruction of the airstrips, the armed forces claimed credit for seizing some five tons of cocaine and 12.5 tons of coca paste, the largest seizure ever in Honduras. Honduras is a key transit point for cocaine shipments moving between South and Central America. The US State Department has said that up to 79 percent of all cocaine smuggling flights from South America first travel to Honduras. While the armed forces have presented the dismantling of these illicit airstrips as evidence of their progress in the fight against organized crime, it is worth questioning whether they are permanently destroyed. The true challenge may lie in ensuring that drug traffickers cannot return and rebuild the runways. General Osorio has previously noted that drug traffickers are heavily reliant on air strips, sometimes providing up to three alternate landing sites for a single drug flight.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Arrests Show Arrival of Barrio 18 Gang in Italy. The recent capture of alleged Barrio 18 gang members in Italy confirms the spread of the Central American mara gangs in Europe, but questions remains as to whether this means they are now truly transnational criminal organizations. Italian police arrested 15 suspected Barrio 18 members in Milan and other nearby cities in northern Italy, reported AFP. The group -- which was mostly comprised of Salvadorans but also reportedly included two Italians -- is accused of crimes including extortion, drug trafficking, armed robbery and the attempted murder of a rival from the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) gang. An Italian judge ordered the arrests following an investigation that began in January 2014 after a female Salvadoran accused one of the group's members of sexually assaulting her, according to AFP. Central American gangs like Barrio 18 and MS13, which are known as ""maras,"" have been operating in Italy for years, particularly in northern immigrant communities, the report added. Over the last two years, security forces in both Italy and Spain have noted the expansion of the MS13 in Europe, and these latest report confirms they are not alone -- their great rivals in Barrio 18 have also crossed the ocean. The key question surrounding this development is whether the spread is a result of Central American migrants bringing mara street gang culture with them and setting up autonomous networks, or whether these new European based factions are running criminal operations with maras in Central America, suggesting the gangs have made the leap into transnational organizations. Both gangs are also well established in parts of the United States and the US government has already designated the MS13 a transnational criminal organization, ranking them alongside criminal groups such as the Mexican cartels. However, despite evidence of cross-border collaboration in criminal activities, the decentralized nature and highly localized and territorial focus of the maras has always cast doubts on this classification. There have also been reports of the Spanish maras coordinating with their counterparts in the Americas, but even if this level of cooperation were to expand, it is unlikely they would have the capacity to coordinate serious transatlantic criminal operations. If they were to seek to establish control over transnational activities such as drug trafficking in Europe, they also would likely encounter formidable opposition; in Spain drug trafficking and associated activities such as contract killing is largely controlled by offshoots of Colombian cartels , while Italy is the domain of powerful and well-connected mafias such as the 'Ndrangheta."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Poppy Production Latest Development in Honduras Drug Trade. Honduran authorities have reported the first ever discovery of an opium plantation in the country, a new milestone marking the country's ever-growing role in the international drug trade. On January 31, Honduran officials reported that they had discovered and destroyed a high-tech greenhouse growing opium poppies and marijuana on a mountain in west Honduras, Inter Press Service reported. The greenhouse was found in the municipality of La Iguala, 400km from capital city Tegucigalpa and 1,600 meters above sea level. The location is only reachable by horseback or all-terrain vehicle, and becomes inaccessible during the rainy season. The raid discovered 1,800 opium poppy plants and 800 cannabis plants. The structure itself was reportedly 100 meters long and 40 meters wide, air-conditioned, with a large generator, a modern irrigation system and other high-tech equipment. Two people were arrested in the raid, a Honduran laborer and a Colombian who managed the farm and had been previously arrested and released, reported La Prensa. Carlos Mejia, a deputy superintendent of the National Police who headed the operation, told IPS, ""We suspect there are many more plantations in these enormous western mountains, so we are combing the entire region."" The revelation that Honduras is now a location for high-tech opium production is just the latest sign of to the country's slide into the hands of powerful criminal elements. Since a 2009 coup, the presence of foreign organized crime has increased markedly and, according to the US State Department's latest estimate, 75 percent of cocaine leaving South America by plane transits through the Central American nation. Part of this criminal expansion has involved the growth of drug processing, with several cocaine labs discovered in Honduras since 2011, but the arrival of opium poppy cultivation is a major new development suggesting criminal operations are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are confident of being able to operate with impunity. While foreign criminal organizations have played a large role in driving this evolution -- the cocaine processing plant discovered in 2011 allegedly belonged to Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel -- there are growing indications that homegrown organized crime groups are also building strength and moving up the drug trafficking value chain. If local criminal groups do successfully increase their role in drug production, it raises the possibility that Honduras could soon generate its own transnational criminal operations and become major players in the international drug trade."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Can Ecuadors Virtual Currency Deter Money Laundering?As Ecuador rolls out a cellphone-based digital currency in the coming months, a potential boon for 40 percent of the population without bank accounts, questions remain as to whether it has enough protections to prevent criminals using it to launder money. Touted as an electronic form of the dollar, the Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE) created the Electronic Money System , a centralized virtual currency intended to widen access to financial services -- around 40 percent of economically active Ecuadorans don't have bank accounts. To get the digital cash, users have to go to a transaction station, show ID, and physically trade in their US dollars, which can then be sent via mobile phone to other people and businesses. Since signup began in December, the BCE has registered over 11,000 accounts, which are limited to Ecuadoran citizens and tied to their national ID numbers. Although adoption remains low (they want 500,000 users by the end of 2015), new services are coming online, and by mid-2015 the Central Bank says users will be able to pay utility bills, taxes, and credit card bills from their mobile phones. Early worries the system could be used to launder money prompted the government to announce transactions would be limited to $2000 per month and $300 per day for individual users (companies would have higher limits), according to El Comercio. ""We have a whole department that will be dedicated to monitoring [unusual transactions]. It will be very easy to track electronic money in this system,"" said Faustio Valencia, who oversees the program for the Central Bank, in October. In a conversation with InSight Crime, former Deputy Finance Minister Luis Mejia Montesdeoca expressed a more cautious view. Even though Ecuador has made efforts to comply with international anti-money laundering standards, according to Mejia, ""it is too early to tell if [the electronic money system] will have a positive effect in the fight against money laundering. We cannot know."" Many citizens remain skeptical of the project, although far more are unaware of it, the Guardian reported. Misinformation about the system abounds, like speculation Ecuador is trying to supplant the US dollar as its national currency, which analysts say is a possibility but the government vehemently denies ( pdf ). Whether or not the system will be used for criminal activity remains to be seen, but it certainly may avoid pitfalls seen in other digital currency schemes, like the virtual SUCRE or Bitcoin. Money launderers have used the SUCRE (the Spanish acronym for Unified System for Regional Compensation), a digital currency created by countries in the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA) to ease trade. And Bitcoin , a decentralized internet currency in which participants use cryptography to create new coins and verify transactions, has seen rampant and highly publicized illegal use. According to a report by the Financial Action Task Force ( pdf ), virtual currencies are vulnerable to money laundering because they allow users to make transactions anonymously. Other weaknesses include a lack of clarity regarding anti-money laundering compliance and no central oversight, the report noted. But centralization is no clear path to success when it comes to avoiding illegal transactions. Only the central banks of ALBA nations can use the SUCRE, not individuals. Still, five percent of SUCRE transactions were deemed suspicious in 2013. When an importer in Venezuela wants to buy a product using bolivars from an exporter in Ecuador, Venezuela's central bank converts the domestic currency into sucres and sends them Ecuador's central bank, where the exporter is paid in US dollars. Financial statements from the BCE show Ecuador received $431 million in sucres in 2014, the vast majority from Venezuela. The trouble arises when sham companies use a money-laundering tactic called trade misinvoicing. According to the Wall Street Journal , one company in Ecuador exported calcium carbonate for $1000 a kilogram, notable due to the fact calcium carbonate only costs 17 cents a kilogram. The company can then claim the extra $999.83 as legitimate income. While Ecuador's new system has no clear ban on international transactions, the fact that users have to be citizens, and sending and receiving money requires Ecuadoran cell service, effectively eliminates the possibility of international illegal digital cash flows. Bitcoin, which is often compared to Ecuador's electronic money system, is widely used to buy drugs from online internet marketplaces. Silk Road, the first and biggest such marketplace, was taken down in 2013 and the FBI seized a bitcoin haul to the tune of $33.6 million. The currency has also come under fire for money laundering concerns -- in April 2014 one Bitcoin entrepreneur was convicted for facilitating $1 million in illegal payments. In its informational material, the BCE has tried to distance its e-cash from crypto currencies like Bitcoin and emphasizes the electronic money system is not anonymous. And unlike Bitcoin, which can be untraceable if used properly, Ecuador will be able to track every transaction made in the system, which has also led to privacy concerns. One expert told the Guardian the system ""has the potential to be a surveillance programme."" Money laundering in Ecuador is a serious problem given its dollarized economy. Large amounts of physical cash leave the country illegally, and according to a Global Financial Integrity report , Ecuador registered $1.9 billion in illicit financial outflows in 2012. The Economist Intelligence Unit showed Venezuelan groups create fake companies in Ecuador, declare non-existent exports, and then bring US dollars into the dollar starved Venezuelan market -- where they are worth far more on the black market. The electronic money system can't resolve these problems -- it is not a tool to prevent other forms of money laundering -- but its design may reduce illegal use."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Black Market Websites the New Criminal Frontiers. Online black markets hidden in the murky ""deep web"" are becoming more sophisticated and selling a wider range of illegal products than their predecessors, a dangerous trend that illustrates the evolution of online criminal activity. According to Wired , a new online marketplace called Evolution that was created earlier this year offers over 15,000 mainly contraband products including illegal drugs and weapons. Unlike Silk Road -- a similar marketplace that was taken down by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2013 and only sold ""victimless"" contraband -- Evolution reportedly offers stolen credit card numbers and other information that facilitates identity theft. Evolution also has more sophisticated security measures than other online black markets and a complex financial system that prevents bitcoins -- a digital currency -- from being seized by law enforcement, reported Wired. According to Wired, Evolution is the third largest online black market bazaar, after a similar site called Agora and Silk Road's successor, Silk Road 2. Websites like Evolution represent the newest frontier in online criminal activity and exist in a shadowy parallel internet system known as the ""deep web"" or ""dark web."" The deep web hosts encrypted websites that allow users to navigate anonymously , making it a haven for criminals offering a range of contraband items and services including illegal drugs, hired assassins, and child pornography. Deep web transactions typically take place using digital currencies like the largely unregulated bitcoin, which can be traded with almost complete anonymity. In addition to purchasing illegal goods, virtual currencies can be used to launder money. In April, bitcoin promoter Charlie Shrem was indicted in the United States and charged with money laundering and failing to file suspicious activity reports for allegedly selling over $1 million in bitcoins to individuals who used the currency for illegal activities. Although websites like Evolution are extremely difficult for law enforcement to track and remove, they are not completely immune to prosecution. In October 2013, the FBI arrested the alleged owner of Silk Road, who went by the name of Dread Pirate Roberts on the deep web. According to Time magazine , authorities believe Silk Road facilitated $1.2 billion in bitcoin transactions, many of which involved illegal drugs. As Wired's report demonstrates, however, Silk Road has already been replaced by larger, more sophisticated black market sites with an even greater potential for facilitating drug trafficking and other illegal activities."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Hacker Group Arrest in Colombia Points to Evolution of Cyber Crime. Authorities in Colombia have dismantled a network of hackers accused of stealing over $5 million from electronic bank accounts, in a case that highlights the fast paced evolution of cyber crime and the potential profits it offers. On June 17, Colombian police announced the capture of 12 alleged hackers from a group accused of stealing the financial information of 15,000 people and using their bank accounts to finance a social security scam. Police said three of the suspects sent out e-mails containing links to a spy program that copied bank account and password information from the recipient's computer. The other members of the group contacted businesses and offered to process the social security payments of their independent workers at a steeply discounted price. The group then used the stolen financial information to make social security payments from victims' bank accounts through an online payment program. In total, the hackers allegedly stole over $5.2 million from accounts affiliated with 11 different banks on the Caribbean Coast and in the cities of Cali, Bogota and Bucaramanga. The suspects were captured in the coastal cities of Barranquilla, Santa Marta and Cartagena. Cyber crime has become a serious problem throughout Latin America as law enforcement struggles to keep up with continually improving criminal technology and methods. Over half of companies in the region fell victim of some form of cyber attack in 2012 and the theft of confidential information reportedly costs banks in Latin America over $93 billion a year. In Colombia, six million people reportedly fall victim to cyber crimes every year. Government websites have also been targeted , with the hacker group Anonymous attacking the former intelligence agency's website in 2011 along with President Juan Manuel Santos' Facebook page and ex-President Alvaro Uribe's Twitter account. In an effort to crack down on cyber crime in the region, Microsoft announced the creation of an anti-cyber crime office in Colombia in 2013 aimed at combating online criminal networks. Governments throughout the region have taken steps to address this issue, with Peru updating its criminal code to reflect cyber threats and several countries developing specialized police units. However, as demonstrated by this most recent case, which Colombian police said employed a new method to access bank accounts, the authorities face a stiff challenge in tackling cyber crime, as it is rapidly evolving, with new criminal networks and new techniques springing up constantly.	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Ex-FARC Mafia Drives Park Rangers Out of Colombias Amazon. Continued threats by criminal groups have led park rangers in Colombia's protected areas of the Amazon rainforest to abandon their posts, leaving these territories to fall under the control of gangs. In February 2020, at least 20 rangers left their posts in the national parks of Chiribiquete (Caqueta and Guaviare), Cahuinari (Amazonas), Yaigoje Apaporis (Amazonas), La Paya (Putumayo) and Pure (Amazonas) after reportedly receiving threats by dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), also known as the ex-FARC Mafia , Colombian media reported. The groups warned the rangers to leave these territories or be killed. ""Your presence is not needed because we will take care of the environmental controls. We already have the respective manuals on resource management, fishing, hunting and felling of timber. We do not want national parks here,"" was the message that members of the ex-FARC Mafia's Carolina Ramirez Front delivered to park rangers in Chiribiquete national park, Semana reported. And these are not hollow threats. Yamid Silva, a ranger in the El Cocuy Park in the department of Boyaca, was murdered in early February. According to a November 2019 report by Mongabay, armed groups pursue a range of criminal economies in these protected areas, especially illegal logging. Since 2017, legal and illegal groups have led deforestation campaigns in the departments of Meta, Magdalena, La Guajira, Cesar, Norte de Santander, Antioquia, Cordoba, Valle del Cauca and Narino. But criminal groups are not the only ones carrying out this activity. According to Colombia's Peace and Reconciliation Foundation , ""the protected areas and their respective buffer zones are subject to illegal burning and logging by rural farmers who are no longer stopped by an armed actor in the zone, nor by regulation."" The rangers are left all the more vulnerable by the lack of a state presence in many of these remote parks. As InSight Crime has reported , other criminal activities in these parks include growing crops such as coca and marijuana, illegal mining and deforestation in order to build roads to facilitate the movement of illicit goods. With the rangers gone and other authorities unlikely to act in the parks, criminal groups can operate in these protected areas with increasing impunity, putting Colombia's under-pressure natural wealth at risk. Park officials in Amazonas -- who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons -- told InSight Crime that since the peace agreement with the FARC was signed in 2016 and the group demobilized, drug trafficking has spiked. The Cotue, Amacayacu and Putumayo rivers, all of which traverse the parks, are mainstays for moving drugs and smuggled gasoline, used in drug processing and illegal mining. In response, President Ivan Duque's government has launched a series of special operations, such as Operation Artemisa that deployed troops to take on these criminal networks and halt deforestation. But while Artemisa, according to a government review in September 2019 cited by Caracol, has destroyed over 400 coca processing labs and arrested a number of gang members, it has not landed a real blow to the presence of criminal groups in national parks."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Timber Laundering in Peru: The Mafia Within. The mafia that makes trafficking of illegally-sourced wood possible in Peru is not made up of timber trade outlaws. It is a network of corrupt officials. In Pucallpa, the hub of the illegal timber trade in Peru, dirty wood is laundered by an array of timber traffickers, who range from individuals armed only with connections and an eye for a deal, to major businesses owned by powerful timber barons. None of them, though, could operate without the regional government body charged with protecting the region's forests: the Forestry and Wildlife Management Directorate (Direccion de Gestion Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre - DIGEFFS). These regional forestry directorates are the gatekeepers to an industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But they work not to protect the forests and regulate the trade, but instead to profit from the ransacking of the Amazon. *This article is the result of research on eco-trafficking in the region done in conjunction with American University's Center for Latin American and Latino Studies ( CLALS ). ""The wood arrives here and it is lost completely,"" said a Pucallpa forestry agent, who did not want to be identified for fear of professional repercussions. The reason is simple. ""This is where the worst of it all starts -- the high-level corruption."" Permits to Steal Regional forestry directorates such as the DIGEFFS were born of a move in 2009 to decentralize oversight of the forestry sector in Peru's main logging regions, bringing it under the control of regional governments. This devolution of power granted the newly created directorates control of the most important resource of all for the illegal timber trade: the transport permit, known as the ""Guia de Transporte Forestal,"" or ""GTF."" GTFs show wood is from a legal, authorized source and can be moved and sold. ""With these permissions the wood is already laundered,"" said Albino Aliaga Campos from the Pucallpa office of the Agency for the Supervision of Forest Resources (Organismo de Supervision de los Recursos Forestales - OSINFOR), the state body charged with inspecting the logging sector. ""When it is being transported you can't tell if the timber is legal."" InSight Crime obtained documentary evidence illustrating one of the most common ways GTFs make it into the hands of timber traffickers -- they are cloned by corrupt officials. In the first document there is a GTF filled out for legal timber harvested from an authorized concession. In the next, is the exact same GTF but filled out with presumably illegal timber listing a local sawmill as owners of the wood. However, the reproduction of documents to launder illegal wood is just one service offered by the forestry directorate corruption networks. Much of it starts with inspections and verifications. Officials man road and riverside checkpoints all along the timber transit routes and carry out onsite inspections at sawmills and other facilities. These officials turn a blind eye to illegal timber as it passes through; they also forge traceable supply chains by fraudulently verifying the passage of timber from concessions through checkpoints and to sawmills that never see the wood itself. ""They are not control points, but [money] collection points,"" Pucallpa forestry agent Antonio Chambergo told InSight Crime. The directorates' stamps of approval are also needed for another key laundering process: fraudulent operating plans that secure logging companies permission to harvest fictitious trees. These plans are compiled by forestry agents known as regents, then approved by forestry officials. Once they are approved, then the companies can fill the fraudulent quotas with illegally logged wood. Between 2009 and late 2018, OSINFOR filed reports of nearly 2,500 suspect plans approved by forestry directorates across Peru, granting permission for the harvest of 114,000 non-existent trees. Those responsible for the concessions are sporadically sanctioned for these violations, but the forestry officials and regents almost never face repercussions, much to the consternation of OSINFOR. ""If it is fraudulent, then there is a chain of responsibility there,"" said Aliaga. The directorates' services do not end with facilitating the trafficking of timber, they also provide protection. Forestry regents describe officials taking payments to falsify reports and paperwork in order to secure the release of seized shipments, while prosecutors complain about how directorate officials sabotage and undermine their investigations. For those that work in the directorate, the opportunities are endless, and the work is lucrative. ""You see officials with wage of 2,500 ($750) soles a month walking around with a new motorbike, car, wife and two mistresses - where did this money come from?"" said Chambergo. 'Supply Chain Was Created to be Corrupted' Control of the machinery of the forestry directorates means control of a criminal economy, and regional governors decide who heads the directorates. ""The directorate is completely corrupted, from the doorman right up to the director,"" said Julio Reategui, a prosecutor from the Pucallpa organized crime unit. ""This network of corruption starts with the governor -- that is undoubtable. The governor names the head of the directorate, so it is impossible that he ignores what his director is doing."" Industry insiders and state investigators claim governors grant campaign donors forestry directorate jobs to fill with their own people for a certain period of time. Controlling these jobs is not just about power, it is also about money and a cut of the bribes that flow through each position. ""Those that invest in power do it to profit from it,"" said a state anti-corruption investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""[The timber barons] put their trusted people in place to take advantage."" Through the money funnelled through these positions they can expect to easily double their investments, she added. The first administration to take control of the forestry sector following decentralization in Ucayali, the department of which Pucallpa is the capital, was governor Jorge Velasquez and his vice governor, the timber baron Carlos Henderson. During their time in office, Henderson's logging company had its license suspended for using its concession to launder illegal wood, a decision controversially overturned after the vice governor filed a lawsuit. Velasquez, meanwhile, would later be sentenced to five years in prison on corruption charges. The forestry directorate under Velasquez and Henderson was accused by the Ucayali Auditing Commission of forging signatures on timber harvest permits to facilitate illegal logging and labelled a mafia by a prosecutor from the environmental unit, who claimed he was removed from his role because he launched corruption investigations involving high-ranking officials. ""They are the owners of the timber trade,"" the prosecutor said in a 2014 television interview. The administration's first forestry director was Miguel Ronald Davila Henderson. OSINFOR inspections show that in his two years in the role he personally signed off on 106 plans approving permission to harvest 6,044 fictitious trees. He was later charged with corruption and embezzlement , named in a land trafficking and illegal logging case, and barred from holding public office. Davila Henderson was succeeded by Marcial Pezo Armas, who personally signed off on 102 plans for 7,798 fictitious trees. Although he has never been charged with any crime, Pezo Armas has been denounced to prosecutors multiple times, including for corruption, timber trafficking, forestry crime and abuse of authority. In the most recent elections, in late 2018, the toxic influence of the timber trade was again evident. The elections became a runoff between two timber barons, Edwin Vasquez and Francisco Pezo. Vasquez is the owner of Pucallpa's largest sawmill, Aserradero Vasquez, which authorities identified as at high risk of criminal activity in a 2015 investigation. He was governor of Ucayali from 2003 to 2006. While in office, he was accused before congress of financing illegal logging and processing protected species in his sawmill. After he left office, he was charged with corruption. He is a political ally of Pucallpa timber baron and alleged drug trafficker Luis Valdez Villacorta, and together the pair have faced accusations of plotting to murder journalists investigating their activities. Before the campaign, local media reported Vasquez had survived an attempt on his life, which he blamed on his political enemies, and soon after he saw his sawmill raided by the tax and customs authorities. Pezo, meanwhile, has previously been the registered owner of sawmills and timber traders, and during the campaign it was revealed he owed the tax authorities over $250,000. In the October vote, Pezo won comfortably. But his administration's plans for the timber sector immediately fell under suspicion. First, there were social media postings, including by a group claiming to be DIREGFFS workers, denouncing how officials were strong-armed into making political contributions in order to secure jobs. Then, Pezo brought back one of the Velasquez administration's directorate chiefs, Marcial Pezo Armas, not related to the governor, as his forestry director. Pezo Armas denies any wrongdoing both related to corruption from his previous time in office and in campaign contributions. ""Officials are always, for various reasons, subject to accusations. Those of us who accept these positions know it before taking on these challenges,"" he said. ""[These accusations] have not led to a single sentence that has found me guilty,"" he added. Governor Pezo did not respond to questions about corruption and the timber trade. A consultant to the national forestry chamber of commerce, who spoke on condition of anonymity, blamed the system. ""This supply chain,"" the consultant said, ""was made to be corrupted.""

Bolivia Bust Shows Demand for Wildlife in China. A recent eco trafficking bust in Bolivia involving Chinese nationals demonstrates how the trade in exotic animal parts is being fueled by Asian buyers. The operation followed months of monitoring and investigation and resulted in police confiscating parts from an estimated 54 animals including jaguars, leopards, snakes and armadillos. Two Chinese nationals and a Bolivian were arrested in relation to the case, reported El Deber. The parts were bought locally from hunters and then inlaid with precious stones and metals so as to raise their value in international markets, according to the newspaper. Recent cases have shown Chinese nationals are increasingly involved in the illegal animal trade, sometimes even poaching the animals themselves. Often they will work in areas that are used by drug traffickers and where the Bolivian government's presence is minimal. In two prominent reserves, for example, there are just 12 rangers to cover the 40,000-hectare expanse. The parts are used in traditional medicine in China and can demand incredibly high prices. In some areas of China, jaguar testicles are said to increase men's sexual wellbeing and are valued at the price of gold. Teeth and claws are often used as a status symbol to demonstrate wealth and success among China's rich. Chinese citizens residing in Bolivia will often use the postal service to traffic the parts. In six months in 2014, the Bolivian Forestry Police confiscated eight packages destined for China and containing jaguar fangs. To date, none of the shippers have been convicted. The traffickers can expect a return in Asian markets comparable to smuggling cocaine. Efforts have been made by non-profit groups to reduce the demand for endangered animal parts in China. The International Fund For Animal Welfare (IFAW) has reached out to Chinese celebrities and athletes to produce public service campaigns that address how ivory and other animal parts are sourced. Chinese demand for exotic animal parts is making poaching an extremely attractive enterprise in developing nations like Bolivia. The $400 to $800 paid for jaguar and puma skins is several times the country's average monthly income. For many rural hunters, the low risk and high reward associated with providing rare animal parts to Chinese buyers has an appeal that can't be ignored. For Chinese nationals living in Bolivia and acting as middlemen, they have very little legal exposure. The animal parts are procured by locals and processed by third parties. Once ready, the parts are sent through the post without the need for complicated shipping routes. When the goods reach Asia the traffickers can expect a hefty return. Although efforts have been made in China to inform buyers about the origin of exotic animal parts and reduce the demand, the focus has been principally on addressing the ivory trade. Exotic animal parts used in alternative medicine in Asia derive much of their appeal principally because of the exotic nature of the animal. The demand on Bolivia's ecosystem is likely to continue as long as Asian buyers are willing to pay high prices for animal parts.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"How Mexican Crime Groups Profit From Illegal Fish Bladder Trade. A new report has highlighted the need for authorities in Mexico to treat the trafficking of illegal fish bladders as an urgent security issue, assessing the factors fueling the illicit trade and providing recommendations for how authorities could do more to combat the environmentally harmful criminal activity. A report by the non-profit organization C4ADS published this month has shed light on how organized crime groups have moved in on the illegal trade of fish bladders sourced from a protected species known as the totoaba fish. Found only in the Gulf of California, the totoaba has for many years been harvested and trafficked via the United States to Asia, where its air bladder is highly sought after. The bladders are commonly used in soup, and are given as gifts or financial investments among elites in China and Hong Kong. But the report suggests that trafficking patterns may be changing. The last seizure of totoaba bladders on the US border was made in 2013, suggesting either that the bladders are increasingly being shipped directly from Mexico, or that traffickers have developed better ways of avoiding detection. In light of concerns for the species' survival, and that of the vaquita, a type of porpoise often killed by the nets used for totoaba fishing, the practice was banned in the 1970s. However, in the early 2010s the trafficking of totoaba bladders resurged, a phenomenon which the report asserts is not indicative of ""opportunistic fishing by a small sub-set of local fishermen,"" but rather a new form of sophisticated organized crime. By weight, totoaba bladders are worth almost twice as much as cocaine, yet trafficking them carries fewer risks. Whereas convicted narcotics smugglers may face 10 to 25 years imprisonment, those found smuggling or fishing for totoaba until recently faced a maximum two-year sentence. Mexican authorities have seized more than 4,000 totoaba bladders , worth some 300 million pesos (about $16.8 million), since 2000. Not only has the trade in totoaba bladders threatened the survival of both that species and the vaquita, it has also developed into a major security problem due to organized crime groups moving in on the trade. According to the C4ADS report, the enterence of criminal networks into the business "" signaled the arrival of a period of volatility and insecurity in the region, as criminal bosses jockeyed to control the totoaba trade in seaside towns and cities, and criminal fishermen began to use their law-abiding counterparts as a smokescreen for illegal activity."" Organized crime groups ""have solidified their hold on the totoaba trade in the Gulf, corrupting those officials who stand in their way (even those who proved resistant to the corrupting influence of narcotics traffickers), and frightening the local populations into silence,"" the report adds. The report suggests that authorities in Mexico as well as those in Asia and the United States have not placed sufficient emphasis on the illicit totoaba trade, and urges ""quick and decisive enforcement action"" to combat it. The authors suggest banning or more tightly regulating the types of fishing used to catch the totoaba, implementing programs aimed at providing totoaba fishermen with viable alternatives, and increasing the amount of law enforcement resources dedicated to the issue."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"High Profile Honduras Murder Case File Stolen. In an incredible turn of events, the case file in the murder of Honduras' activist Berta Caceres was apparently stolen, leaving the government and the international community searching for answers and the file itself. Details of the theft were still emerging, but an initial account by El Heraldo said that it was taken on September 29, when an appellate court judge, who had taken the case file from her office to analyze it at home, was stopped by two vehicles and robbed of her own car. The Mission Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (Mision de Apoyo contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad en Honduras - MACCIH) denounced the decision to remove the documents from the office as ""irresponsible"" and said it was trying to reconstruct the case file. ""The theft of the judicial case file of Berta Caceres is a criminal act and requires an energetic response by the Attorney General's Office and the courts to identify and punish those responsible,"" Juan Jimenez Mayor, the MACCIH spokesperson, was quoted as saying in an official press release September 30. Supreme Court President Rolando Argueta sought to control the damage by stating to the press that the case file has been reconstructed in its entirety and that the case would proceed. ""We would like to restate to the people, to the international community, to those involved in this case, the victims, that, despite this incident involving the case file, there is no way that this case involving Berta Caceres will be compromised, halted or remain in impunity,"" Argueta said. The theft of the case file is more than embarrassing, it is a devastating blow against a government that was trying to show that it was taking the utmost care to resolve a case, which could roil relations between the United States and Honduras. Caceres, an activist who along with several non-governmental organizations was opposing the development of hydroelectric dams in her country, was assassinated March 3. In May, the government captured four suspects, two of whom had direct connections to the company building a dam that Caceres and her cohorts had been protesting. Many believe that that case reaches higher into both the government and the company, and this new development will surely fuel conspiracy theories that the administration of Juan Orlando Hernandez is trying to hide something. The United States has taken a public posture on this case, a rare move that signals how important it is to that government. And MACCIH, the newly installed Organization of American States' appendage to the Honduran judicial system, has made the case the centerpiece of its efforts to help end impunity in the country. Mindful of this reality, Argueta said authorities would investigate the possibility that the theft of the case file was something more than a mistake. ""We have to analyze the case and determine if it happened because of negligenceor if the fact that [the judge] took the case file from the court to her house goes beyond negligence and represents a criminal act,"" Argueta said ."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Drug Traffickers Laundered $250 Million in 2015: Peru Official. A top government official in Peru said drug trafficking organizations laundered $250 million last year, while Peruvian and US authorities highlighted the key role other illegal economies such as illegal mining and timber trafficking play in facilitating money laundering operations. At the International Drug Enforcement Conference, which is being held in Lima this year, Interior Minister Jose Luis Perez Guadalupe said Peruvian drug traffickers laundered a quarter-billion dollars in 2015, reported El Pais. Peru's National Police Director, Vicente Romero, noted how drug traffickers often use other criminal industries to launder their proceeds, saying, ""the illegal mining platform is ideal for camouflaging money from other illegal businesses."" On the eve of the conference, William Brownfield, US Assistant Secretary of State of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, said he is interested in exchanging information with authorities in the region on the links between drug trafficking and illegal logging networks. ""Although they are distinct crimes, the organizations use the same transportation and distribution networks, the same money laundering and financial systems,"" Brownfield said. Meanwhile, authorities recently dismantled a timber trafficking network in Peru that had been operating for six years, reported La Republica. Law enforcement arrested 19 people in Lima and Pucallpa, including two police officers and two employees of the General Directorate of the Wildlife Flora and Fauna in Ucayali. The arrests were the culmination of ten-month investigation by a joint force composed of organized crime prosecutors, national police officers and members of the Interior Ministry. Over a six-year period, the loggers trafficked timber worth an estimated $20 million. The timber was exported to Asia and North America, according to La Republica. As the authorities point out, drug trafficking is intimately entwined with other illicit industries in Peru, some of which are considered even more lucrative than the cocaine trade. The recent timber trafficking bust demonstrates how the potential profits from illegal logging and mining can corrupt law enforcement officials, enabling these criminal structures to run their operations unmolested for years. By some estimates, 80 percent of all timber in Peru is removed illegally. Environmental crimes such as timber trafficking are also seen as low risk because of the relatively light penalties offenders incur. Prison sentences for eco-traffickers range from 3-5 years in Peru, while drug traffickers receive anywhere from 8 to 15 years. This sentencing discrepancy is seen in other countries throughout Latin America as well, including Costa Rica, Brazil, and Colombia."	0	0	0	0	1	1	0
"How China Fuels Wildlife Trafficking in Latin America. China's demand for rare and exotic goods is fueling wildlife trafficking in Latin America -- and organized crime is ready to cash in. The global black market trade in wildlife is now worth an estimated $19 billion a year, making it the fourth-largest illegal industry worldwide behind drugs, counterfeiting and human trafficking, according to a report by the non-profit International Fund for Animal Welfare ( pdf ). Latin America has come to play an important role in this trade due to the hemisphere's diverse range of ecosystems, the lack of awareness and enforcement on the part of states, and an array of criminal groups with pre-existing smuggling networks ready to take advantage of new opportunities. A driving force behind the region's growing illegal wildlife trade is China, where demand for exotic goods and rare food delicacies has risen with the country's burgeoning middle class. Marine animals, which are often used in traditional Chinese recipes, have been particularly in demand. An especially hot commodity in recent years has been the bladder of Mexico's totoaba fish. The totoaba is an endangered fish found only in the Gulf of California in Mexico, and is prized for the gas-filled sac it uses to help regulate buoyancy. This sac, or swim bladder, is a sought-after delicacy in China, where they are dried and served in a soup that is said to have medicinal qualities. The bladders can sell for as much as $20,000 in China -- the high price is a result of the Chinese species of the totoaba being hunted to extinction -- while in Mexico bladders sell for between $7,000 and $14,000, according to investigations by Mexican media. In 2013 , Mexican authorities seized an estimated $2.25 million worth of illegal totoaba bladders. April of that year also saw one of the most significant cases of bladder smuggling to date, when US authorities arrested a man for smuggling 214 bladders from Mexico into the United States, from where they were to be sent to Asia. The seized bladders were worth an estimated $361,500 in Mexico, $1.265 million in the United States, and $3.6 million in the overseas black market. A bladder trafficking debt was even rumored to have been the reason for the murder of an alleged drug trafficker and organized crime boss in Mexico in June 2014. In addition to totoaba bladders, Asian demand has spurred the illicit harvesting and trafficking of sea cucumbers in Latin America. Believed to be an aphrodisiac and to have medicinal properties -- such as treating high blood pressure -- the sea cucumber market in China and Hong Kong has been estimated at $60 million a year, with sea cucumbers selling for as much as $600 per kilo. While the illicit harvesting of sea cucumbers has been seen in the past in places like the Galapagos Islands, evidence suggests criminal networks in Mexico -- especially along the Yucatan Peninsula -- are increasingly moving into the business. And it is already getting dangerous -- on April 29, some 10 armed men stole 3.5 tons of dehydrated sea cucumbers in the town of El Cuyo in Yucatan state, according to local media reports. Selling for around $450 per kilo in Mexico, the haul was estimated to be worth over $100,000. While Mexican authorities have identified networks operating along the Yucatan coast in western Mexico that traffic sea cucumbers to Asia , trafficking routes also pass through the United States. In January 2015, a San Diego court charged a Chinese-American with exporting to China more than $3 million worth of illegal seafood smuggled in from Mexico. The shipments included almost a ton of sea cucumbers as well as 58 totoaba swim bladders. Along with the poaching and trafficking of totoaba bladders and sea cucumbers -- which has remained relatively isolated to specific regions -- Asian demand has also fueled the more geographically disperse practice of ""shark finning"" in Latin America. Poachers in several countries hunt and kill sharks for their fins, which are used in China and other Asian countries such as Singapore and Taiwan to make shark fin soup. Past estimates have suggested that 26 to 73 million sharks are killed annually worldwide. China is the destination of around 75 percent of this trade, say environmental groups, as shark fin soup costing as much as $200 per bowl is a common dish at wedding banquets and celebrations. The depletion of shark populations in Asian waters has pushed the practice of shark finning further afield, with places like Peru and Ecuador providing fertile territories for illegal shark fishing. A set of fins from a single shark can reportedly earn fishermen in these locales as much as $100, with a kilo of fins worth up to $700 in Asia. In May 2015, Ecuadorian authorities reported the confiscation of almost 100,000 illegal shark fins, taken from an estimated 30,000 sharks. Central America has also been a focal point of shark finning, with the problem at its most acute in Costa Rica. In March 2015, the government of Costa Rica sparked outrage after it authorized the export of 900 kilos of hammerhead shark fins to Hong Kong despite having banned shark finning in 2012. Costa Rica still exports 67,000 kilos of shark fins to Hong Kong annually , according to the estimates of local environmental organizations. There are several key forces combining to drive the increase in marine wildlife trafficking and eco-trafficking in general from Latin America to China. Primary among these has been China's economic success in recent decades, which has led to rising incomes and the growth of the middle class. As a result, new sectors of Chinese society have been able to afford luxury items and status symbols traditionally reserved for the country's wealthy elite. As demand for ecological luxuries has risen, traditional regional sources for such items have been depleted, and so Chinese markets have looked abroad to regions like Latin America to fulfill domestic demand. Access to new supplies of luxury goods like sea cucumbers and totoaba bladders in Latin America has been facilitated by China's growing economic ties with the region in recent years -- increasing trade between the two has eased the movement of both licit and illicit merchandise. Indeed, owing to these closer ties, Latin American criminal groups and opportunists alike are well positioned to take advantage of Asia's profitable and voracious black market. And, in recent years, there has been consistent evidence of Latin American and Chinese criminal groups establishing ties and developing inter-regional networks to supply a range of illicit commodities; including drugs , illegally mined minerals , contraband , precursor chemicals for making methamphetamine, and timber from Central America. These evolving criminal connections between the two regions are indicative of a trend across Latin America; criminal groups diversifying their revenue streams and moving away from relying on drug trafficking and into activities like extortion , resource theft , and eco-trafficking. The expansion of organized crime into eco-trafficking has also been aided by states that have proven ill-prepared and at times uninterested in tackling the issue. Regional and global trends suggest Latin America and China will become ever more intertwined, as the forces of globalization pull down trade barriers and ease communications. And, as illustrated by the booming trade in eco-trafficking between the two, new markets for legal commerce look set to be accompanied by new markets for illegal goods -- something Latin American organized crime is always quick to capitalize on."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"LatAm Most Dangerous in the World for Environmentalists: Report. A new report by the international watchdog group Global Witness says two-thirds of documented killings of environmentalists over the last decade occurred in Latin America and nearly half in Brazil, as environmental campaigns clash with both legal and criminal business interests, especially in the timber trade. ""Deadly Environment"" documents the killing of 908 citizens protecting land and environmental rights in 35 countries between 2002 and 2013. In the majority of cases, however, the identity of the perpetrators is unknown, and there have been only 10 convictions over that time period, the report says. Over the course of a decade, the annual number of murders tripled, with 147 in 2012 compared to 51 in 2002. Over the last four years, there has been an average death rate of two activists per week. Global Witness says Brazil is the most dangerous place for environmental activists, whose 448 cases accounts for just under half of the recorded killings; Honduras is second globally, with 109 cases, while Peru ranked fourth globally with 58 murders, followed by Colombia with 52. Many of the murders of environmentalists in Latin America are not linked to criminal organizations but to legal business interests, such as victims of land rights disputes in Honduras, or anti-mining protesters murdered in Peru, the report says. However, organized crime is heavily involved in activities such as eco-trafficking, which are often at the root of the violence. The illegal logging trade in particular is one area where criminal and environmental interests clash, and, according to Global Witness, threats and intimidation by interests linked to the sector are one of the principal causes of activist deaths. The impact of the illegal timber trade -- which is worth up to $30 billion annually and has strong links to organized crime -- is particularly apparent in Brazil, where deforestation, spurred by illegal logging, has been increasing. And Global Witness says land conflicts linked to the Amazon's deforestation accounted for 68 percent of all murders linked to land disputes in Brazil in 2012. The issue rose to prominence in 2011, when Jose Claudio Ribeiro da Silva and his wife Maria Do Espirito Santo da Silva -- two prominent environmentalists who denounced the encroachment of illegal loggers in the northeast Brazilian Amazon state of Para -- were murdered by masked gunmen. Poor prosecution rates in Brazil -- just one percent of cases resulted in a conviction, according to Global Witness -- and the influence of powerful loggers in isolated rural areas, means most murders of environmental activists go unsolved."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Nicaragua Timber Trafficking Devastates CentAms Largest Forest Reserve. Authorities in Nicaragua seized over 1,400 cubic meters of timber harvested illegally from a northern forest reserve in 2013 -- likely just a fraction of what was extracted by illegal wood mafias supplying markets in Asia. National Forest Institute (INAFOR) director William Schwartz said the wood came from the Bosawas Biosphere Reserve, which lies at the western edge of the North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN) of Nicaragua, reported El Nuevo Diario. According to Schwartz, most of the wood is smuggled out through border ""blind spots"" into Honduras, whereas timber cut down in the south is trafficked into Costa Rica. Schwartz added that INAFOR also plans to create a network of control points to examine wood shipments. Environmentalist Jaime Incer Barquero said the Nicaraguan army's Ecological Batalion had also taken various measures to combat timber trafficking, including forbidding night shipments to reduce the chances of failing to detect false permits. Nicaragua's illegal timber trade has become a major problem in recent years. Exports of granadillo -- a precious wood used to make musical instruments and furniture -- grew from just over $100,000 to $6 million between 2008 and 2011. In 2012, authorities seized over 1,300 cubic meters of lumber, according to Confidencial. The Bosawas reserve , Central America's largest forest reserve, has been a particular target for land traffickers , many of whom use the stolen land for illegal timber extraction. According to authorities, over a third of the forest in the reserve was lost to deforestation between 1987 and 2010. The trade is driven in part by demand from Chinese buyers, and is run by ""wood mafias"" operating with the help of corrupt officials and transporters. As noted by Schwartz, Honduras is the first destination of much of the wood shipped out of Nicaragua. Honduran criminals have actively cashed in on the trade, with armed groups from that country reportedly moving deep into Nicaragua to log precious woods. The location of Bosawas at the edge of the RAAN and near the border with Honduras makes it particularly vulnerable to this kind of incursion. The RAAN has become an important stop-off point for drug shipments , and residents of the region have complained of an influx of Honduran traffickers. Granadillo trafficking is also a major concern in the RAAN's southern neighbor , the South Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAS). Timber trafficking, worth up to $100 billion worldwide is a major problem in other parts of the region including Guatemala , Venezuela and Costa Rica and is believed to have links with major criminal groups in Colombia and Peru."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Battle Over Venezuela Gold Behind Killings of Miners. Another massacre perpetrated by the army in Venezuela's mining region has prompted the country's congress to announce that it will take the case to international courts and initiate an investigation. The war for gold between the military, government officials and criminal organizations involved in illegal mining could be the motive behind these killings, which have increased in the midst of the country's worst economic crisis and the threat of international sanctions on its main export: oil. On February 10 in the town of Guasipati in the southeastern state of Bolivar, a Venezuelan army raid on the Cicapra mine left 18 people dead. Although there were no wounded soldiers, state Governor Justo Noguera Pietri -- an official from the Bolivarian National Guard (Guardia Nacional Bolivariana - GNB) who is among those sanctioned by the US government for human rights violations -- contended that the officers had been ambushed by a criminal gang. ""It was an attack on a military commission [in which] compliance with protocols"" was necessary to repel it, said the governor, in what has been the only official statement from any government official about the incident. Among the victims of the massacre are a woman, her partner and her 19-year-old son. Angelis Rodriguez Cuevas was a mine operator, and for over 15 years her family had a government permit to operate the Cicapra mine, which is one of the most productive in the region, and where the highest purity gold is obtained. ""Rodriguez was summoned to the Ministry of Mines in Caracas, where officials requested that she incorporate her mine into the Orinoco Mining Arc [a transnational mining project created by Nicolas Maduro's government in February 2016]. She answered the summons and participated in a meeting where she showed willingness to negotiate the handing over of the mine to the government,"" National Assembly Deputy Rachid Yasbeck told InSight Crime. However, six days later -- when the miners were sleeping -- came the early morning military incursion. Yasbeck told RunRun.es he believed the victims were executed, as 11 of them presented bullet wounds to the head. Also among the dead were a farmer and taxi driver delivering contraband fuel, a trade they were just getting started in. ""The country's situation led them to fuel smuggling, and this was their first trip. They arrived on Thursday afternoon and decided to stay and sleep in the mine because it was getting dark,"" a relative of the victims told journalist German Dam, who has reported on other killings in the mining area. ""This case needs an in-depth investigation to clarify a lot of things, mainly those related to the involvement of the military,"" said Yasbeck, who represents the state of Bolivar. On February 20, a week after the massacre, the Venezuelan congress announced that it will begin investigations and will require the appearance of the army officials who participated in the military operation. The official release also said that the case ""will be subject to many international proceedings."" But this is not the first mining region massacre that the Venezuelan parliament is investigating. The Cicapra massacre is just one of more than 30 registered in the mining towns of Bolivar over the past 12 years, National Assembly Deputy Americo De Grazia, who has been keeping a log of such slayings, told InSight Crime. Although Cicapra has left the highest number of victims in its wake, it was the Tumeremo massacre in March of 2016 that exposed the criminal dynamics generated by gold mining. In that incident 17 miners were killed , and the participation of both police officials and criminal gangs was confirmed. However, it remains unclear whether military officials close to the governor or high-ranking government officials were also involved. Massacres in recent years have brought attention to this region, known for its abundance in coltan, gold and precious stones. But violence generally in the state of Bolivar has increased since the creation of the Orinoco Mining Arc. In 2017, it was the state with the fourth highest homicide rate at 113 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, while El Callao, a municipality in Bolivar with one of the highest levels of gold mining activity is now registered as the most violent in the country, with a rate of 817 homicides per 100,000 according to data from Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia. The cause of this spike in violence are the criminal dynamics that has been developing in the area. There are reports that military and government officials are sharing control of mining operations and the region in general with ""pranes"" (a word often used to refer to jailed gang leaders, but in this case for local crime bosses outside the prison walls) and ""sindicatos"" (literally, ""syndicates,"" criminal organizations arising from the labor system, but that should not be confused with labor unions). ""The pranes become withholding agents that charge small-scale miners a 'vacuna' or extortion rate of 30 percent of the gold they mine. They also fix the price at which the miner will sell the rest of the gold. The pran has direct control over the mine, enforcing the rules and reporting to the 'generalato' [a group of high-ranking military officials], and the gold is mined from Venezuela's forested regions. They give a quota to the state and leave the country with the rest,"" stated De Grazia. (See diagram) (Click image to enlarge) However, when a dispute or disagreement comes up, it is the military that conducts ""cleaning operations"" or ""government changes,"" shifting control of the mines to other criminal groups with which they have reached new -- almost always temporary -- agreements. ""So, all this trouble and all the massacres that have been happening in Bolivar state, basically in the gold region, are due to the increase in extortion. When the miners start falling behind or refusing to pay, that's when the massacres start,"" De Grazia explained to InSight Crime. ""The massacres are part of a state policy involving military leadership, and the aim is to control the gold to smuggle it, to take it to Brazil, Colombia, Trinidad, Aruba, Curacao and Bonaire."" This report coincides with recent information released on social networks on the alleged illegal transport of Venezuelan gold in government and personal planes to destinations such as Dubai, China and some Caribbean islands by order of government officials. As a prime example, on February 9, a Venezuelan merchant was arrested in Aruba with 46 gold ingots valued at more than $2 million, just one day before the Cicapra massacre. The identity of the man, who intended to travel to Holland, was not disclosed, nor were further details of the case. But this practice is not new. A report from the GNB obtained by InSight Crime describes the arrest in May 2017 of a Venezuelan citizen carrying a two-kilo gold ingot in his luggage. The traveler was detained while preparing to board a flight to Bogota and was identified as the brother of an ex-president of the state-run company Bauxilum, located in Bolivar state. ""It's not clear what the mining arc is; it seems like a way to take advantage of the situation. Five thousand tons of gold per year should be going to the nation's coffers, but that's not happening,"" De Grazia said. Some of these acts can be attributed to the search for alternative means of income by the Venezuelan government due to the little wiggle room officials have been left by sanctions imposed by the US government and other countries. According to De Grazia, what is occurring is the result of the Maduro administration's attempt to ""switch from an oil boom to a mining boom."" This, coupled with the recent threat from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who confirmed that the US government would continue to ""impose sanctions on Venezuelan oil ,"" might have intensified the war for gold in Venezuela ."	0	0	0	1	0	1	0
What Is Behind Killings in Venezuela Illegal Mining Regions?State forces have reportedly been responsible for a wave of killings in Venezuela's illegal mining zones, sparking questions over whether they are combating criminal networks, clearing the way for multinationals or looking to control the trade themselves. According to Efecto Cocuyo , local press reported 61 killings in five mining municipalities in the southeastern state of Bolivar between the start of 2017 and mid-September. Of these, the Venezuelan military was responsible for 40 deaths, and police a further seven. Local residents told Efecto Cocuyo they believe the killings by security forces are part of a strategy to remove the illegal miners in order to turn over the territory to multinational mining companies. The most recent deadly confrontation took place on September 10, when 11 people were killed and two soldiers injured in the municipality of Tumeremo in a shootout at a mining site. Official sources stated the confrontation began when a military unit approached the mine and came under fire from a criminal gang exploiting the operation, reported El Universal. However, opposition politician Americo De Grazia tweeted to say witnesses are reporting the miners were executed, and are scared of reprisals for speaking out. Violence linked to the criminalization of Venezuela's informal mining sector dates back over a decade. In recent years, though, there has been a clear escalation, and the murders registered in 2017 follow the deadliest incident recorded yet, the March 2016 disappearance and supposed murder of 28 miners in the same municipality of Tumeremo. There is no doubt that criminal networks are indeed forming around the illegal mining trade, and the Venezuelan government has connected these groups to violence. But, as illustrated by the comments by De Grazia and local residents, the panorama is much more complicated. De Grazia has previously denounced the involvement of the military in illegal mining, claiming they are not looking to shut it down but rather exploit it for their own profits. He is not alone in making these allegations, with a former governor of Bolivar also accusing the military of extorting miners in order to allow them to work and colluding with gangs in violence. Residents, meanwhile, claim that the killings are part of a plan to remove illegal miners to make way for multinationals, basing this conclusion on the Venezuelan government's decision last year to open up the country to large-scale industrial mining. Whether the theory is true or not, it is likely that the entry of multinational companies onto the scene could complicate an already volatile situation.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0
Illegal Gold Mining in Costa Rica Suggests Diversifying Criminal Landscape. Recent reports suggest illegal gold mining and the associated trafficking of mercury are increasing in Costa Rica, providing evidence that organized crime groups in the country may be diversifying their revenue streams as they increase in sophistication. Twenty-five illegal extraction points have been identified recently in an area known as Cutris on Costa Rica's northern border with Nicaragua , according to La Nacion. Cutris is home to an open-pit mine known as Las Crucitas, which was operated by a Canadian firm from 2006 until the concession was revoked in 2011 following changes in Costa Rica's mining regulations. Now, La Nacion reports, illegal miners have moved in to try to exploit the remaining gold reserves. As with many illegal mining operations, the techniques used in Las Crucitas are rudimentary and often dangerous. One of the main methods for uncovering gold is to apply mercury to muddy riverbanks; the dangerous metal helps separate the gold from the ground. In conjunction with the growth of illegal gold mining, the illicit trafficking of mercury may also be increasing, a separate report from La Nacion suggests. Costa Rican border guards made their most recent seizure of nearly two kilograms of illegal mercury on May 13 in the area near Las Crucitas. Greivin Rodriguez, an expert in illicit mining in Las Crucitas, told La Nacion that in addition to weapons, illegal miners often bring significant amounts of mercury with them. However, this process -- documented in a 2014 video by the non-profit group Pure Earth -- has extremely harmful effects on people and the environment, as mercury is extremely toxic. Rodriguez explained that authorities in Las Crucitas have not conducted any environmental impact studies, and there are no preventive measures in place to protect the environment from mercury pollution. The rivers being contaminated in the area also supply water for the local community and its school, according to La Nacion. The recent uptick in illegal gold mining in Costa Rica highlights how criminal groups in the country are growing more sophisticated and may be searching for new revenue streams. Towards the end of 2015, authorities in Costa Rica began to see the growing sophistication of the country's criminal groups. In October of that year, authorities busted an international cocaine trafficking operation being run by the Italian mafia group 'Ndrangheta. At least five cocaine shipments, including a 3.5 ton and 40 kilogram shipment, were linked to the operation. The arrival of the Italian mafia hinted at the evolving role of homegrown Costa Rican criminal networks in the international drug trade. Other powerful transnational organized crime groups have also made their presence felt in Costa Rica. Last year, a drug trafficking network linked to Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel was dismantled in Costa Rica. And just this year, Costa Rica's Attorney General said that local criminal groups were being recruited and trained by Mexican cartels, a further indication that Costa Rican crime groups may be growing in sophistication. Moreover, Costa Rica's criminal groups are becoming increasingly involved in cocaine trafficking coming from Colombia, so much so that security officials have warned that they are incapable of stopping transnational drug traffickers from using the country's beaches as transshipment points for drugs destined for the US. Illegal mining is big business for crime groups throughout Latin America due to its extreme profitability. Therefore, the apparent expansion of this illicit industry in Costa Rica may be cause for concern on the part of the authorities, particularly if it contributes to the growth of local crime groups that the government is already struggling to deal with.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"LatAm is Most Murderous Region for Land, Environmental Activists: Report. Latin America is the most dangerous region in the world for activists fighting for their land or trying to safeguard the environment, according to a Global Witness report, which also provides insight into why these defenders are at such high risk. The year 2016 was the worst year recorded for environmental and land activist murders, according to a worldwide study published July 13 by the nongovernmental organization. Most of the approximately 200 registered killings -- around 60 percent -- took place in Latin America, Global Witness said. While Nicaragua held the highest activist murder rate per capita, Brazil saw the largest number of murders, followed by Colombia. Honduras had the highest average rate per capita over the past decade. (See Global Witness breakdown below) Number of Land and Environmental Rights Activist Killed in 2016, Top 11 Countries. C/o Global Witness The report makes special mention of Colombia, where 2016 was ""by far the worst year on record,"" for land activists. Paradoxically, the government's peace process with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) has increased the risks for land rights activists, it argues. Billy Kyte, Global Witness' campaign leader on land and environmental defenders, told InSight Crime that this was one of the biggest surprises of the investigation. The main reason for this trend, he said, was probably the return of many displaced persons to their original communities, bringing them into conflict with armed groups involved in exploitation of lucrative natural resources. Foreign investment is also a contributing factor. Another factor, Global Witness says, is that the Colombian government is using the ""post-conflict"" climate to encourage more foreign investment into the country, something that has long been associated with extreme violence against local activists who challenge the operations of foreign companies. In Honduras, foreign investment is also a contributing factor. ""In the vast majority of cases, land and environmental defenders are threatened because they have questioned or opposed a commercial project,"" the report reads. Furthermore, foreign investors have continued to bankroll projects despite allegations of associated human rights abuses. One of the more prominent examples from 2016 is the murder of activist Berta Caceres , allegedly as a result of her opposition to a dam project. Global Witness says the hydroelectric project for years received funding by the Dutch Development Bank (FMO) and the Finnish Development Bank (Finnfund), even as activists reported threats and attacks against them. One of the key issues the report draws attention to is that national governments are exacerbating the problem by not consulting local communities regarding large-scale development projects that often cause displacement and environmental damage. As negotiation is hardly possible, local communities find their only recourse is protest, exposing them to physical repression. ""Caceres was only forced to take a stand because the indigenous Lenca people were never consulted on its development by the Honduran state or the company contracted to build it,"" the report reads. Another recurring factor is national governments' inability or unwillingness to protect land activists. These have repressed outspokenness against human rights violations, while passing legislation that favors private interests over those of its citizens, the report claims. ""Many of these projects wouldn't get a go-ahead, if it wasn't for corruption,"" Kyte said. Global Witness' report spotlights several developments in the dangers faced by Latin American land activists. First, it reaffirms some of the most critical issues surrounding the implementation of Colombia's historic peace deal: the protection of those that will be left most vulnerable by the withdrawal of the FARC guerrillas. The rebel army was long the only source of security for thousands of rural dwellers. But today communal leaders find themselves in greater danger as they fight to preserve their territory from exploitation by criminal groups, including those looking to impede the restitution of land to displaced persons. It is now up to the government to ensure safety in rural areas. Failing to do so would further hurt public support for an already shaky peace process, and help new criminal gangs consolidate social control. In this regard, the Colombian government is not off to a good start. As foreign capital flows into the country, the government must also ensure that history does not repeat itself. Several multinationals -- including Coca Cola , Nestle , and the banana company Chiquita -- have been accused of collaborating with paramilitary groups to protect their operations in Colombia in the past, including eliminating social leaders, union heads and activists who stood in their way. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Human Rights Greater communal participation in foreign operations on Colombian soil may help prevent these types of abuses. Colombia's natural riches must be left alone until local people are guaranteed security and ""are able to make their own decisions on what happens to their resources and to their land,"" Kyte told InSight Crime. ""Until that is in place [the government] should not be promoting investment in those far flung, lawless regions."" In 2017, the idea that multinationals should obtain a ""social license"" from the local community to implement large-scale projects gained more steam when the town of Cajamarca set a historic precedent by successfully expelling mining giant AngloGold Ashanti following a public referendum against its local project. Honduras may be taking this one step further with a proposed law on the prior consultation of indigenous and afro-Hondurans on the use of their land. This would reduce the likelihood of public resistance, while helping to guarantee the financial and personal security of locals. This said, it is also necessary to flag up certain stumbling blocks in collecting data on the murder of activists who have been murdered because of their work. It is not always possible to determine whether or not the killing of a defender is related to their activism, and some of the cases considered in the report were possibly motivated by other reasons, according to InSight Crime research. That ambiguity -- which Global Witness acknowledges -- can be wielded by those seeking to repress the issue. As Global Witness suggests in the report, government officials at times deny links between the murder of activists and their activism, leaving many to doubt whether any of the attacks are related to their work. This risks leaving this very real danger unaddressed."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Emerald Czar Accused of Planning Bomb Attack in Bogota. Witness testimony implicates a recently captured emerald baron in the planning of a daring bomb attack against a competitor in Colombia's capital city, another sign of how deeply enmeshed the underworld is in the country's lucrative mining industry. During a recent court hearing, Carlos Arturo Alvarez Montero said he was approached by Horacio Triana, an emerald czar arrested earlier this month , to plant a bomb in a Bogota building, El Tiempo reported. Triana planned for the bomb to go off in the personal elevator of Hernando Sanchez, another prominent emerald trader formerly aligned with Victor Carranza. Prior to his death in April 2013 , Carranza was the most powerful figure in Colombia's emerald business. Triana is believed to have ordered the October 2012 attack against Sanchez in an upscale part of Bogota known as the Zona T. Sanchez was shot 11 times by a would-be assassin but somehow managed to survive after undergoing over a dozen operations and spending two months in a coma. Alvarez Montero testified that Triana first contacted him in December 2012, just a few months after the initial attack. The witness said he refused the offer, although he admitted the two sides met again in May 2013. According to El Tiempo, Alvarez Montero is a former hitman who in the 1980s worked for Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, alias ""El Mexicano,"" the right-hand man to notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar. For decades criminal groups have been drawn to Colombia's emerald industry, as it is loosely regulated by the state and provides a convenient way to launder drug money. In fact, in the 1980s Alvarez Montero's old boss, El Mexicano, attempted to push Carranza out the emerald business, igniting a conflict that became known as the Emerald War and left some 6,000 people dead. Carranza and a Catholic priest helped broker a peace accord in the early 1990s, but since the emerald czar's death in 2013 there have been signs the new leaders of the industry are no longer abiding by the old rules. Pedro Rincon, who became perhaps the most important figure in the emerald industry after Carranza's passing, was the object of a grenade attack in November 2013. Several other important players have been gunned down by armed rivals. The ongoing violence is a sign the industry remains infiltrated by criminal interests and out of the state's control. The original emerald czar is lone gone, but the government has yet to wrest control over the industry from the remaining barons."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Doubling of Mexico Mining Losses Sign of Growing Criminal Involvement. Mexico's iron and steel industries suffered losses of $1.3 billion in 2013 due to theft and illegal mining, illustrating the growing importance of the mining industry as a source of funding for criminal organizations. Mexico's National Committee of Iron and Steel (CANACERO) reported that 10 million tons of iron -- sold at $100 per ton -- were exported in 2013 by organized crime groups, which force legal miners out and then set up their own operations, reported Excelsior. Much of the illicit product is sent to China. These figures represent a 100 percent increase in illegal exports and profits of iron since 2010, when criminal groups reportedly exported five million tons and made $500 million off the trade. Meanwhile, the theft of steel products on Mexican highways by armed criminals looking to sell the goods on the black market amounted to an additional $300 million in losses. Currently, the state of Nuevo Leon is one of the principal areas of concern for steel theft, with incidences of the crime rising 300 percent in 2013. Mexico's criminal groups have become more deeply involved in illegal mining in recent years, as the fragmentation of major cartels and increased competition in the drug trade has caused a shift to alternative sources of financing. The most recent figures serve to highlight just how lucrative this involvement has become. Among the hardest hit states are Tamaulipas, Chihuahua, Guerrerro, Morelos and Michoacan, where criminal groups now controlling mining iron, gold, silver, and copper mining. The Knights Templar criminal organization has profited particularly well from the iron trade, controlling various steps in the mining process for iron headed to China from their stronghold in the state of Michoacan, home to the port of Lazaro Cardenas -- the principle point of export for the product. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Mining A similar phenomenon can be seen in Colombia, which has also experienced an increasingly atomized criminal landscape, where criminal organizations such as the Urabenos , the Rastrojos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) profit from both the extortion of mining companies and control over gold and tungsten extraction. Peru also has a massive illegal gold industry , estimated to be worth up to $3 billion a year. However, unlike in Colombia and Mexico, illegal gold mining in Peru is largely unlicensed, rather than run by armed groups, though there are signs the industry could have ties to the drug trade .	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Mexico Organized Crime Controls Mining in Five States. Criminal organizations now control the right to mine in at least five Mexico states, according to those working in the sector, in another example of illegal groups expanding into resource exploitation in areas where state presence is weak. Dozens of mining companies -- including multinationals -- are being extorted by criminal groups in the states of Tamaulipas, Chihuahua, Guerrero, Morelos, and Michoacan, leading some companies to appeal to the federal government to take action, reported 24 horas. According to sources consulted by 24 Horas, the situation is particularly grave in mineral-rich Michoacan, where both local companies and international companies from countries such as the United States, Canada, China and India must pay for the right to extract and transport metals including iron, gold, silver, and copper. The sources said government efforts to tackle the issue by setting up military checkpoints throughout the state have so far failed. The involvement of Mexican criminal groups in resource extraction has been a problem for some time and not just through extortion -- earlier this year the accounts of 12 mining companies accused of ties to drug traffickers were frozen as authorities investigated claims of money laundering, tax evasion and breach of federal regulations. The movement of illegal groups into mining has been seen across the region, especially in Colombia where both guerrilla and drug trafficking organizations are heavily involved in both extorting miners and running their own illegal mining operations. According to the authorities, in at least eight Colombian provinces, gold mining has overtaken drug trafficking as the main source of funding for illegal groups. While gold is the mainstay of illegal mining, criminal groups have also branched out into other sectors, such as the precious minerals tungsten and coltan , which are mined by the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). As in Colombia, in Mexico criminal involvement in mining is highest in regions where the state lacks control, either due to the difficulties of policing isolated regions with inhospitable terrain or because of the control exerted on the areas by criminal groups.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Colombia Sees Booming Market for Synthetic Drugs at Home and Abroad. Colombia authorities have dismantled a network of traffickers who hid the synthetic drug ketamine inside superhero figurines on their way to the United States, China, and other countries. The ketamine bust, one of a string of busts of its kind in Colombia, underscores the extent to which the market for synthetic drugs is booming, both at home and abroad. A nearly yearlong investigation into the criminal network by the Cali police ended last month with the arrest of 15 people, Semana reported. The gang shipped the ketamine overseas, stuffing it in Hulk figurines destined for China, Mexico, the United States, Argentina, and Ecuador, police said. Up to 700 packets of the drug were hidden inside the dolls. The ketamine originally came from Ecuador, according to the report, and was smuggled on buses to Colombia. The group also manufactured and sold other synthetic drugs, such as 2-CB, LSD, methamphetamines, and ecstasy. These types of so-called designer party drugs have also found a sizable market in Colombia as well. In October, Colombian police took down a separate network of synthetic drug traffickers calling themselves ""The System,"" Semana reported. This group sold drugs in exclusive clubs around Medellin and Bogota and even made house calls in well-off neighborhoods. A wiretapped call caught the group's leader, a woman who went by Fatima, discussing the price of 2-CB, a hallucinogenic synthetic better known as pink cocaine. The United States, Asia, and Europe have long dominated the market for synthetic drugs. But more recently, wealthier South American countries have become significant consumer markets. According to a 2017 synthetic drug report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, South America first saw in 2013 the wide-scale appearance of this class of drugs, which include MDMA, LSD, ketamine, methamphetamines, and ever-changing compounds, such as 2-CB, synthetic cannabinoids, bath salts, and poppers. These drugs, which the UN calls ""hallucinogenic new psychoactive substances,"" have seen a jump in users in Chile and Colombia, evidenced by an increase in emergency room visits, according to the report. Seizures of the drugs are also up. Brazil captured nearly 400 kilograms of ecstasy in 2014 and 2015, according to the report. Synthetic drug seizures in Argentina increased 500 percent in 2016. Synthetic drugs' high street price -- a gram of 2-CB sells for $60 to $75 in Colombia -- and popularity among moneyed teens and college students has made them a profitable niche market. This can create atypical traffickers, such as the Pablo Escobar of pink cocaine -- a young Colombian from a middle-class background who traveled to Europe to get the recipe for the synthetic drug 2-CB. The drug became known as pink cocaine for its color and powdery texture. More established traffickers, however, have muscled in on the trade. In 2014, police arrested the so-called czar of synthetic drugs who was also a leading figure in the criminal groups the Machos and the Urabenos. In 2015, Colombian and US authorities broke up a synthetic drug trafficking network that supplied six countries in the region. And when the young Colombian, Alejandro Arboleda Uribe, was caught in Medellin, police said Mexican cartels were protecting him and providing the necessary precursor chemicals. Medellin's ""Oficina de Envigado,"" a powerful coalition of criminal groups, distributed the drugs, El Colombiano reported. The bust of the Colombia ketamine traffickers, and the discovery last month of 1,300 grams of pink cocaine embedded within a painting of the Virgin Mary on its way to New York from Bogota's airport, show that criminal groups aim to profit from moving these substances abroad. For now, however, the rising consumer markets in Latin American countries remain much more lucrative."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Report Documents Explosive Growth in Chile Contraband Cigarette Trade. A new report indicates that Chile's contraband cigarette trade has increased exponentially during the past five years, a reminder of how profitable the illegal industry is for organized crime groups. The amount of illegal cigarettes traded in Chile has increased by 386 percent since 2012, according to a report by the Observatory on Illicit Trade (Observatorio del Comercio Ilicito - OCI), which is part of Chile's National Chamber of Commerce, Services and Tourism. By the end of 2016, the study estimated that 15.4 percent of all cigarettes in Chile were illegal, and that the illicit trade resulted in over $290 million in lost tax revenue every year. Santiago is home to an estimated 15 percent of all illegal cigarettes in the country, but cities in the north are also centers for contraband. For instance, in the port of Arica, the OCI report estimates that 84.1 percent of all traded cigarettes are of illicit origen. Not only does the unlawful trade represent a threat to legal businesses, it also appears to be linked to sophisticated criminal networks. ""We are worried about the way in which these products enter our country, which is through contraband a phenomenon directly linked with the financing of terrorism,"" said OCI representative Jorge Lee in comments reported by BioBio. Indeed, the illegal cigarettes trade ""very often constitutes the last step in the chain of transnational criminal networks,"" Lee added. An estimated 78 percent of all illegal cigarettes in Chile come from three brands: Fox, based in Paraguay; Pine, based in South Korea; and Jaisalmer, based in India. Cigarette contraband may not be as notorious as other criminal activities, but it does represent an enormous revenue source for organized crime in Latin America. According to estimates cited in 2014 by the US military publication Dialogo, the illicit cigarette trade combined with the trade in contraband alcohol could be worth billions of dollars per year for regional crime groups. In addition, the fact that Paraguay accounts for so many of the illegal cigarettes traded in Chile is not surprising. As InSight Crime has previously noted , Paraguayan contraband cigarettes have been a key revenue source for organized crime groups across the region. In Mexico, for instance, black market cigarettes from Paraguay have been financing criminal groups like the Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel. In Colombia, the illicit tobacco trade has reportedly been used to launder drug money by the 59th and 19th Fronts of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) as well as by a criminal group led by Marcos Figueroa, alias ""Marquitos,"" who is now believed to be part of the Urabenos criminal organization."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
In Food-Starved Venezuela, Cartel of the Flour?Authorities in food-poor Venezuela arrested two individuals on suspicion of smuggling almost three tons of white powder, but it wasn't the usual seizure of illegal drugs. It was flour. Police officers in the municipality of Juan Antonio Sotillo, Anzoategui state, seized 2,700 kilograms of wheat flour on August 26, reported Sumarium. Responding to a tip of suspicious behavior from neighbors, the officers went to a private residence. Upon arrival, they discovered 60 bags containing 45 kilos of flour apiece. Neither the alleged owner of the bags, 1st Lt. Luis Alberto Quero Silva of the Bolivian National Guard, or the residence's owner, Maria Ignacia Arrioja Maraima, where unable to justify the provenance of the goods. Both were arrested and charged with contraband by means of diversion. There is a certain dark irony in the news of such a large amount of flour being seized in Venezuela, a country which regularly makes the headlines due to its significant role in the transshipment of South American cocaine. But the bust is unsurprising given the mass shortages of food and other goods that Venezuelans currently face. The food crisis has given rise to other surprising stories, such as a report this month examining how a prison has become a supermarket for basic goods. As InSight Crime previously reported, organized crime has greatly benefitted from Venezuela's economic crisis, both in the country and in neighboring Colombia. While Venezuela has long been a supplier of many subsidized basic goods to Colombia's contraband market, especially gasoline, the food shortages have led to the reversal of the direction of contraband. Moreover, the fact that the person caught in possession of the allegedly contraband flour is a member of the armed forces comes as no surprise. Unable to turn around the country's crumbling and corrupt economy, President Nicolas Maduro decided last month to strengthen the army's control over the production and distribution of food. Venezuela's armed forces are infamous for corruption within their ranks -- including the alleged involvement of senior officers as leaders of the Cartel of the Suns (Cartel de los Soles) drug trafficking network. Members of the military have been implicated numerous times in drug trafficking cases, but only lower-ranking officers have been arrested by Venezuelan authorities. Members of the military have also been implicated in contraband along the border with Colombia, and the armed forces were put in control of the Venezuela's ports last month by President Maduro. That the officer arrested in connection with the flour was accused of contraband by means of diversion makes it likely that he used his position to divert the suspected contraband from the stocks recently put under military control. The possibility the lieutenant was working as part of a group -- 3 tons of product is quite a logistical challenge for an individual -- could be a sign that criminal networks within the military are expanding from drug trafficking to 'bachaqueo' - the act of reselling basic products that have become extremely scare in the country. There is precedence for such a shift among low-level criminals, with some drug dealers switching to food trafficking .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Colombia Customs Official Got Rich Off Contraband. A former top official for Colombia's customs agency reportedly increased his wealth exponentially by collaborating with smugglers, allegations that, if true, illustrate how the corruption fueling Colombia's contraband boom extends far beyond the lower ranks of enforcement. Humberto Angulo Montero, the former tax and customs head for two of Colombia's most important port cities -- Cartagena, on the Caribbean, and Buenaventura on the Pacific side -- was arrested earlier this month on illicit enrichment charges. Prosecutors said his assets inexplicably increased by 580 percent between 2003 and 2009. The investigation into Angulo began in 2007, after a transparency watchdog notified prosecutors that he was allegedly creating a ""hotbed of corruption for contraband textiles and liquor,"" reported El Espectador. According to the accusations, while running the customs offices in Buenaventura and Cartegena, Angulo would help his collaborators underreport shipments of shoes, textiles, alcohol, and cigarettes by as much as 50 percent. Angulo denies the charges, claiming the increase in his assets can be explained by the fact that he received an additional salary as a former Navy captain, reported El Espectador. Contraband smuggling is a hugely lucrative criminal activity in Colombia, especially along its eastern border where it is fueled by price controls in Venezuela. According to authorities, there is increasing overlap between established organized crime groups and the contraband trade, especially when it comes to money laundering. While some types of smuggling are more blatant -- especially on land, where convoys of vehicles dash across clandestine border crossings -- the bulk of the trade involves complicit officials who underreport how many goods are entering or exiting the country, as embodied by Angulo's case. This method of smuggling is known as ""technical contraband,"" and involves using forged or altered documents to move goods through legal channels in ports and airports (such as those highlighted in the map below) before diverting them into the black market. According to the Colombia's tax and customs agency, the DIAN, this accounts for approximately 76 percent of the contraband trade. {googleMaps lat=11.3831092 long=-72.2460937 zoom=6 width=100% height=480 marker=0 addoverview=0 kml=https://enmenteweb.com/insightcrime/maps/contrabandoesp.kmz mapkey=https://enmenteweb.com/insightcrime//images/maps/contrabandoeng.png} Enforcement agencies have freely admitted to InSight Crime that the boom in contraband smuggling has been facilitated by official corruption. Angulo's case, while ongoing, may yet prove to be an important precedent in pursuing the upper echelons of those complicit in Colombia's contraband trade."	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
"Ecuador Officials Reject Report Saying Mexico Cartels Operate There. Law enforcement officials in Ecuador rejected a recent report indicating that Mexican cartels have a presence there, in what is likely an attempt to preserve the country's image as a relatively safe nation, despite mounting evidence that the booming cocaine trade is fueling organized crime across the Andean region. Ecuador National Police official Edwin Noguera rejected the idea that Mexican organized crime groups have an operational presence in the South American country in comments reported by El Universo on November 14. ""You cannot speak of Mexican cartels in Ecuador,"" Noguera said. The police official acknowledged that transnational drug trafficking groups have been identified as having a presence in the country in the past, but he implied that these groups do not engage in drug trafficking from Ecuador. Rather, he said, they come to Ecuador simply to launder money earned from illicit activities. Noguera's comments come days after media accounts citing a report from Mexico's Attorney General's Office (Procuraduria General de la Republica - PGR) asserted that four Mexican cartels -- the Sinaloa Cartel, Zetas, Familia Michoacana and Gulf Cartel -- have a presence in Ecuador as well as Colombia, Peru, the United States, China and other countries. The decision by Ecuadorean anti-narcotics officials to reject the notion that Mexican cartels have a presence in the country is likely an attempt to preserve Ecuador's largely positive reputation when it comes to security. The Andean nation has for years boasted some of Latin America's lowest homicide rates. However, there is strong evidence that Mexican crime groups are in fact engaged in drug trafficking activities in Ecuador, which has seen indications of an uptick in cocaine trafficking recently. While the drug trade through Ecuador has historically been controlled by Colombian organized crime groups, Mexican cartels have been noted as having a presence in the country since as far back as 2012. In 2013, Ecuador's vice-minister for internal security at the time acknowledged the presence of Mexican criminal groups in the country. While conducting field research in Colombia's southwestern departments of Narino and Putumayo, both of which share a border with Ecuador, InSight Crime found that much of the cocaine departing Colombia first stops in Ecuador before continuing on to Central America and eventually the United States. Given that Mexican cartels largely oversee the movement of that cocaine from South America through Central America and on to US markets, their presence in Ecuador would come as no surprise."	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Costa Rica AG Says Mexico Cartels are Recruiting, Training Local Groups. Costa Rica's Attorney General said local criminal groups are being recruited and trained by Mexican drug cartels, further indication of the evolving relationship between drug trafficking networks in these two countries. In an interview with El Universal , Costa Rican Attorney General Jorge Chavarria said that the cartels are recruiting local criminals and bringing them to Mexico, where they are taught cartel strategies in order to apply them back home. While Chavarria did not specify which cartels are doing the recruiting, anti-drug authorities have confirmed that the Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas are the most active drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) in Central America, according to El Universal. The Familia Michoacana and the Gulf Cartel also reportedly maintain a presence in the region. Chavarria credited Costa Rica's rising homicide rate to the Mexicanization of Costa Rica's criminal groups. ""We have an increase in violence because local drug trafficking organizations are applying the Mexican strategy of controlling territory,"" he said. The attorney general also noted the role of Mexican cartels in driving up the consumer demand for cocaine in drug transit nations such as Costa Rica. ""We have seen an ample expansion [in demand] The demand is not just in the United States and Europe; there is an internal demand in all the countries in the region, which is obviously growing due to the increasing amount [of drugs] on offer, because collaboration for trafficking drugs to the United States is paid in drugs and not in dollars."" While Costa Rica has long been a crucial transit zone for Mexican cartels looking to move cocaine to the United States, the recruiting and training of local gangs is a sign that a new power dynamic is emerging in the country's underworld. Mexico's cartels have fragmented due to increased security pressure, which is enabling Costa Rican groups to step into a bigger role in the transnational drug trade. In November 2016, a local drug trafficking network linked to the Sinaloa Cartel was dismantled by Costa Rica's anti-narcotics police. The operation led to the arrest of 14 individuals, as well as the seizure of three tons of drugs and $1.7 million. Another factor strengthening Costa Rica's criminal groups is the increase in local drug consumption mentioned by Chavarria. Higher rates of cocaine use increase the profits for local drug trafficking groups, which in turn generates greater competition and the need for higher-power weaponry. Chavarria has previously noted that Mexican groups are arming Costa Rican gangs with AK-47s and grenades. Costa Rica's underworld was historically under the influence of Colombian DTOs, but Mexican groups became the dominant foreign power following the fall of the Medellin and Cali cartels."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Over 50 Colombians Detained in China for Drug Trafficking: Report. A new report about Colombian nationals detained in China on drug charges calls attention to an emerging consumer market that would appear to be highly appealing to Colombia's criminal groups. An investigation by El Espectador revealed that there are currently 56 Colombians being held in Chinese prisons for drug-related crimes, according to data from the Foreign Affairs Ministry. In total, over 12,800 Colombians are currently behind bars in a foreign country, with 56 percent being held on drug charges. According to the lawyer Blanca Enriquez, who has represented several Colombians detained abroad, many of the suspects are actually victims who have been tricked or forced into breaking the law. The case of Sara Galeano has recently turned media attention towards the fate of such detainees. Galeano was arrested in China for carrying drugs in 2009 and sentenced to 18 years in prison. This year, it emerged that Galeano may be deported back to Colombia on humanitarian grounds due to a chronic illness. In another example, 56-year-old Luis Perez from Quindio department was arrested in February 2013 for flying a suitcase full of drugs to China after his family was threatened, and was sentenced to death seven months later. Colombian criminal groups making what appear to be inroads into the Chinese drug market is hardly a surprise. With a population of over 1.3 billion, a rising middle class, growing drug consumption and a narcotics industry worth an estimated $82 billion, China is surely an attractive market for Colombian groups. Facilitating this flow are strong legitimate business ties: China is currently Colombia's second biggest trade partner. There are certainly signs that cocaine trafficking to China is increasing. Annual cocaine seizures in Asia tripled between the time periods of 1998 - 2008 and 2009-2014, according to data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) 2016 World Drug Report ( pdf ). China is one of the two main Asian destinations for cocaine. Colombian as well as Mexican drug traffickers have increasingly been looking to tap into foreign markets , where risks are greater but potential profits are higher. It should be noted, however, that statistics on foreign arrests are not always a reliable indicator of drug trafficking dynamics. As the arrests in China illustrate, most of the individuals arrested abroad on drug charges are what are known as mules, who occupy the lowest runs of the drug supply chain. It's still uncertain to what extent Colombian criminal groups are moving cocaine shipments into China in bulk.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Faux Pax? A Look at the Dominican Republics Plunging Murder Rate. The Dominican Republic is boasting its lowest murder rates in years, but these figures could merely be concealing a larger threat from more sophisticated manifestations of organized crime. The Dominican Republic -- and especially the capital province of Santo Domingo -- has displayed a startling turnaround in crime levels in recent years. Santo Domingo province is seeing a 15-year low in homicides, with about 13 homicides registered for every 100,000 people, according to recent figures by the Attorney General's Office. Nationwide, the murder rate fell to about 15 per 100,000 during the first six months of 2015, compared to 18 during the whole of 2014 , which was a 12-year national low. This abrupt change may be perplexing to some. A rise in cocaine trafficking through the country did bring about steep increase in violence , with the murder rate more than doubling from 2001 to 2003. From 2003 onwards, this figure oscillated between 21 and 25.6 per 100,000, according to numbers from the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC ), with rates only beginning to fall after 2012. So, what is behind this unprecedented drop in the island nation's homicide rate? Here are three leading theories. A Successful Security Strategy? Crime analysts in the region have come up with a number of theories to explain this trend. The first is that the drop in murders is a direct consequence of an improved security strategy. In 2013, President Danilo Medina ordered the Dominican military to patrol alongside police troops in areas with high crime rates. The police claimed that this resulted in a swift fall in crime rates. However, in an article examining illegal groups and corruption in the Caribbean, which is due to be published by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, sociologist Lilian Bobea refutes the idea that the country's notoriously violent security forces might have forced the decline in crime. In Latin America, a strong police presence has historically only fueled fatalities, while military presence is hardly a novelty in the region and is not enough to justify recent developments in the Dominican Republic, Bobea argues. An Amnesty International report on police abuses in the Dominican Republic makes a similar point, detailing how police killings are on the rise in the country. ""Hard-line policing methods are contributing to escalating violence,"" the Amnesty report states -- by implication, this makes it unlikely that the police and military conducting joint patrols would explain the overall improvement in the Dominican Republic's murder rate. Pax Mexicana? The second theory suggests that the Dominican Republic is seeing less murders because Colombian and Mexican criminal groups -- and specifically the Sinaloa and Zetas cartels -- have taken control of drug trafficking routes through the country. ""Whenever the Mexican transnational trafficking organizations, establish their dominance over a drug market a drop in murders [ensues],"" crime expert Daurius Figueira told InSight Crime. Figueira sustains that, while Colombian criminal group the Urabenos were the dominant trafficking organization in the Dominican Republic for a while, they have handed control of their trafficking networks over to Mexican organizations and become their affiliates. The Mexicans have applied a rigid order -- which Figueira labels ""Pax Mexicana"" -- over their associates, including state agencies and local criminal groups such as Los Trinitarios and Los Tigres. The new Mexican model has supposedly enforced peace among different criminal factions in the Dominican Republic, as well as lining their pockets. A similar pattern can be observed in Puerto Rico, which has also seen the recent incursion of Mexican cartels. Although the past few years saw an increase in violence alongside a rise in drug trafficking, the year 2014 had the lowest murder rate in over a decade. Police Killings Down, Murder Rate Down Despite these developments, however, the most prominent factor behind the Dominican Republic's recent decline in homicides may actually be a drop in police killings. Bobea's research shows that at the same time drug-related violence was going up -- representing over a fifth of all murders in 2007 -- almost a third of killings throughout the country were being perpetrated by the police. But over the past four years, the number of homicides committed by national police fell from 4 and 3 murders per 100,000 to 1.65 in 2013, according to the sociologist's statistics. Why did these numbers fall? It is hard to believe that a notoriously repressive police that has routinely purged its ranks with little success has miraculously cleaned up its act. This may be due to what could be considered a ""Pax Policia."" Bobea proposes that corrupt security forces -- who are known to extort drug dealers -- have managed, for the most part, to subjugate petty criminals, resulting in less violence by authorities. Considering that 90 percent of organized crime is allegedly perpetrated by the Dominican police and military(not to mention that the majority of contract killings are attributed to former police), this theory may especially explain the noteworthy crime decrease in the Santo Domingo province, which Bobea explains is a hub for police extortion. But this is not the first time that police killings have plummeted unexpectedly, suggesting that something more sinister may be behind the drop in deaths. Bobea points out that only in 2002, the newly-instated head of the National Police Jaime Marte Martinez revealed an ""overnight"" nosedive in extrajudicial killings from 171 in 2001 to 103 per year. Far from being a positive sign, Bobea says this sharp fluctuation is an indication that police are consciously deciding when they need to ratchet up the violence and when they should impose ""peace."" ""This for me is the most irrefutable evidence that we're dealing with a rational decision and that it can be controlled,"" she told InSight Crime. The calm before the storm? Although the Dominican Republic is experiencing relatively low homicide rates at the moment, it does not look like this trend will last. Figuiera believes that this calm stage wil end, once local criminal groups inevitably enter into conflict with the Mexican cartels over drug trade profits. Whether or not this indeed lies in store for the Dominican Republic, it is certain that what Bobea labels "" statetropism "" -- or the tendency of organized crime to erode the state -- has the potential to continue to weaken and corrupt state institutions in the Dominican Republic. In some ways, corrupt state agents are becoming traffickers in their own right. Examples abound of low and high-level officials following in the footsteps of the former Dominican army captain Quirino Paulino , who in 2005 was extradited to the United States for money laundering and trafficking 30 tons of cocaine. Among these is the theft of over a ton of cocaine by the head of the country's anti-narcotics police (DICAN) in early 2015, leading to assertions that the country's security forces have in fact become its leading drug trafficking operators. Such prospects do not bode well for a country that looks set to play a central role in the global cocaine trade for the foreseeable future. Although current statistics may mean relative peace for the time being, it could only be a matter of time before they creep up again."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
US Gangs Increase Links to Mexican Cartels. A series of reports highlights growing ties between US gangs and Mexican drug cartels, and the corruption north of the border that helps facilitate drug trafficking -- dynamics that echo what is seen in Mexico. In El Universal, Jose Luis Pardo and Alejandra S. Inzunza, members of the journalist collective Dromomanos , documented Mexican criminal organizations' relationship with both gangs and law enforcement in the United States. They reported how US gangs associated with Mexican cartels -- primarily the Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas -- flourish in Texas border counties. In the outskirts of one county, Zapata, the local sheriff told the reporters that nearly everyone in the neighborhood was involved in criminal activity and that the zone was a hotspot for drug stash houses. Groups like Tango Blast and Texas Syndicate, as well as transnational gangs like the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Texas-born prison gang Barrio Azteca, serve as muscle, couriers and local drug vendors for the Mexican groups, Texas officials told the reporters. Mexican cartels also rely heavily on corruption in the US border region, paying off sheriffs, border agents and customs officials. Sometimes these ties go much deeper than a bribe. One notable example was that of the Panama Unit, an anti-drug police unit in Hidalgo, Texas, which became involved in guarding and stealing drug loads. Cases of drug-related official corruption have emerged in most Texas border counties, according to Pardo and Inzunza. Official reports published this year by California and Texas discussed the increasingly close relationship between gangs in these states and Mexican cartels. In the most recent US National Gang Report , 23 percent of police surveyed said gangs with ties to Mexican organized crime were present in their jurisdiction. Mexican groups have long maintained a relationship with US gangs, but in the past this was largely limited to drug sales. Now, the gangs carry out more sophisticated criminal activities on behalf of cartels, allowing the larger groups to reduce their operational risks in US territory. In return, the gangs receive discounts on the drugs they buy. This is a dynamic also seen within Mexico, where some 43 gangs -- including groups like Los Rojos and Guerreros Unidos, as well as lesser-known gangs -- are now affiliated with the major cartels. This outsourcing of labor is largely a product of a fragmenting criminal landscape, in which the major syndicates no longer enjoy the hegemony they once had. Payoffs to officials is a common phenomenon on the Mexican as well as the US side of the border, with Mexican government officials at various levels, as well as in law enforcement , known to associate with drug groups.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Leaders of Brazils PCC Gang Fled to Paraguay: Police. Police in Paraguay say they believe high-ranking members of Brazil's PCC criminal organization have fled Brazilian justice and relocated to Paraguay to plan further crimes, an indication of the extent to which the group sees the country as a safe haven and base of operations. In an interview with Cardinal AM radio station , Abel Canete, the head of the Economic Crimes Unit of Paraguay's national police, said 15-20 ""important leaders"" of Brazil's First Capital Command (PCC) had been ""rescued"" by the group from Brazilian prisons and had fled to Paraguay to commit ""violent acts."" Canete added that these PCC members were going to target banks and other financial institutions in Paraguay, and advised these bodies to be on the alert. According to Canete, investigations by Paraguayan authorities have also linked the fugitives to a 350-meter tunnel police recently found in Ciudad del Este. The tunnel was reportedly dug from a luxury home owned by a Brazilian national to the headquarters of security company Prosegur, with the objective of stealing around $100 million. The PCC has become Brazil's largest criminal syndicate, and there have been signs that it is expanding operations abroad, with members caught in neighboring Bolivia and Paraguay -- the latter of which is South America's biggest marijuana producer and a key transit point for cocaine. In 2011, Brazilian police identified Paraguay as an increasingly popular outpost for the PCC and other Brazilian gangs looking to take advantage of the country's under-equipped police force, and to eliminate middlemen from their drug trafficking. Recent events indicate that the group may be moving into criminal activities in Paraguay besides drug trafficking. In addition to the tunnel discovered in Ciudad del Este, six suspected PCC members were arrested in relation to a series of ATM robberies using explosives in May this year. However, it is somewhat odd that ""leaders"" of the group would be dedicated to these lower-level criminal activities, and Canete's statement should be viewed with caution -- especially as he has given few details about the fugitives' origins, identity, current location or criminal history."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"4 of Mexicos Cartels Operate in Panama: Officials. Panama's intelligence sources have identified four major Mexican cartels operating in that country, another sign of the widening reach of Mexico's criminals across the region, and of Panama's importance as a regional depot for drug traffickers. According to Panama's La Prensa , these groups are: the Sinaloa Cartel, the Juarez Cartel, the Zetas and the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO). Intelligence reports and officials have confirmed that these cartels operate in the country, says the paper, using it as an operational base to transport cocaine to Mexico and the United States. One sign of this is recent violence committed in the style of Colombian or Mexican hired assassins, Panamanian prosecutor Geomara Guerra told La Prensa, with dead bodies dismembered or showing signs of torture. Officials believe the Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas may be killing off rivals in the country as they move more deeply into Central America. In 2012, then-Attorney General and current Supreme Court judge Jose Ayu Prado said 100 Mexican prisoners held in Panama were accused of membership in drug cartels. Alleged Mexican criminals arrested in Panama include 16 Sinaloa Cartel members caught in 2007 with 19.5 tons of cocaine, the newspaper says. Members of the Zetas and the Juarez Cartel have also been caught moving cocaine through the country. In 2010, jailed capo Edgar Valdez Villareal, alias ""La Barbie,"" also testified that the BLO moved cocaine through Panama to Mexico. The evidence collected by La Prensa is another indication that the connection is deepening between Mexican organized crime and Panama, an important hand-off point for north-bound drug shipments, as well as a traditional money laundering hotspot. Earlier this year, an alleged link between Colombia's Rastrojos and Mexican Cartels was arrested in Panama , and more recently, Colombian officials intercepted a FARC-owned cocaine shipment allegedly destined for Sinaloa Cartel contacts in Panama. Mexican capos have also been reported to do business in Panama, including captured Gulf Cartel boss Andres Vieda Duque, alias ""El Duque,"" and La Barbie. The cousin of Panama's President Ricardo Martinelli was arrested in Mexico and charged with money laundering in 2009, but was later absolved. The Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas have shifted much of their operations into Central America, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). One major battleground is Guatemala , but the Sinaloa Cartel also operates in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and the Zetas in Belize."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Argentinas Evolving Role in the Global Arms Trade. While the seizure of hundreds of high-powered weapons in Argentina and a subsequent investigation offer fresh clues about criminal dynamics in the infamous border region with Paraguay, the country's role in the global arms trade remains unclear. On June 26, authorities in Argentina seized hundreds of high-powered weapons and arrested more than 20 people. Authorities described the international operation as the largest in the country's history. An investigation, started in late 2018, found that the arms -- including rifles, machine guns and anti-aircraft ammunition -- were part of an intricate global operation. Investigators said parts shipped from the United States and Europe were assembled in locations across Argentina. The arms were then sent by land to neighboring Paraguay. Authorities believe the arms were then sold to Brazil's top criminal organizations: The First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital -- PCC) and Red Command (Comando Vermelho). The investigation of the arms seizure in Argentina, which is still ongoing, has revealed new clues about criminal dynamics in one of South America's most prolific criminal hotspots. Below, InSight Crime looks at three main takeaways from the bust. 1. Criminal Groups Eyeing New Routes Until recently, criminal groups in Paraguay acted as intermediaries for weapons trafficked from the United States to Brazil, ensuring a steady flow. There are a number of reasons for this. Taking advantage of lax weapons laws in the United States, crime groups have found it relatively easy to send gun parts through tried-and-tested contacts in Paraguay. There, they were assembled and sent via land to Brazil through routes commonly used to traffic illicit goods. But a ban on arms imports imposed by Paraguay in 2018 may have forced the groups to test alternative routes. This may explain why there were so many weapons seized in Argentina, something that had not been seen before. Rodrigo Bonini, the director of investigations at Argentina's Security Ministry, says that governments in the region need to work together when developing anti-crime policies. ""When one country defines policies to tackle organized crime they have to have a regional perspective, because otherwise the countries left out will be negatively affected,"" he told InSight Crime. 2. Criminal Eyes Set on Argentina The weapons seizure in Argentina was historic because of the quantity of firearms and ammunition that was seized, but also because the country hadn't until now been a major player in the regional or international arms trade. Argentina is home to only a small domestic arms market, according to a 2015 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The country's strategic location, the presence of a large port serving as a direct link to Europe, well-established drug trafficking routes to neighboring Paraguay and a history of corrupt customs officials could help explain why criminal groups might be testing out the country as a new link in the arms trafficking chain. But these groups might confront new challenges amid the growing ties among governments in the region, particularly in the fight against organized crime. The relationship between the administration of Argentine President Mauricio Macri and his counterparts in the United States, which has strengthened in recent years, making operations like the arms seizure more successful. Authorities in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay are also beginning to collaborate more as the three countries attempt to curb the expansion of crime groups. 3. Brazil Crime Groups Growing Even More Powerful The fact that Argentina has only a domestic arms market that lacks the kind of sophisticated weapons seen in the seizure forced authorities to look elsewhere for clues as to where the arms were destined. Although unconfirmed, all fingers point to Brazil's two most powerful criminal groups -- the PCC and Red Command -- as the buyers. Both groups, especially the PCC, have been gaining power in Brazil and internationally. Although there isn't enough evidence to suggest that the group has attempted to expand into Argentina, authorities told InSight Crime that they are monitoring the situation carefully with a particular eye along the country's northern border, where the three countries meet. Judging by the latest weapons seizure, they are wise to do so. *This article was written with the collaboration of the Center for Studies on Transnational Organized Crime (Centro de Estudios sobre Crimen Organizado Transnacional - CeCOT) at the University of La Plata, Argentina."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Homemade Gun Factories Sell Cheap Weapons to Brazil Criminals. Despite the loosening of gun ownership laws in Brazil, the country is seeing a boom in illegal gun factories, with homemade weapons taking up a significant percentage of the country's total seizures. On June 3, police in the Brazilian state of Amapa arrested three men for running an illegal weapons factory. They seized more than 30 homemade shotguns alongside a wide range of parts, including 102 gun barrels. The factory had apparently been operating for more than 20 years. But this seizure was only the latest in the small northeastern state, with similar raids there on firearms factories being made in January and April. In 2018, police in the state seized 380 illegal weapons, most of which were homemade. The three men arrested in the latest raid said that the weapons were meant for local hunters, but police have already connected amateur gunsmiths in Amapa with organized crime. As crime has risen in northeastern Brazil, Amapa has not been spared. The head of the state's special police force (Batalhao de Operacoes Policiais Especiais -- BOPE) recently stated that gun ownership was increasing and most criminals are now carrying at least one handgun. Brazil's economic downturn seems to have been the impetus for the demand for these weapons to spread rapidly. Few such weapons were found in the state before 2014, according to Emerson Morais, a local deputy in the state of Minas Gerais. ""They [criminals] migrated to these types of homemade weapons which also have a high firing capacity, because their value is far lower,"" he told the BBC. He revealed that a black market submachine gun costs around 12,000 reais (around $3,000), while one crafted in an illegal factory can be purchased for only 5,000 reais (around $1,300). While in the case of Amapa, some homemade guns may be used for hunting, there is no doubt that the production of illegal firearms is primarily done with criminal customers in mind. A recent BBC report looked at the manufacturing of illegal submachine guns within Brazil and found that seizures of such weapons have grown in virtually every state in the country. This production was long mostly reported in the country's largest cities. A study of over 14,000 weapons seized in Sao Paulo in 2011 and 2012 found that 48 percent of them were likely homemade. Most of these were submachine guns, seemingly often based on the Brazilian Uru model. Historically, Brazil has been known for stringent gun regulations which have made it difficult for the average citizen to obtain a firearm. The production of illegal weapons thus profited from high demand and low supply. Most of the makers of these weapons are not affiliated with any particular criminal groups, being happy to sell to almost anyone. They are able to skillfully modify or replicate existing weapons, while providing added benefits, such as allowing for 30 rounds or more to be fired in one burst, according to the BBC. New laws by President Jair Bolsonaro have loosened import regulations for weapons and made it easier for citizens to obtain firearms. There has been widespread concern that this will simply lead to more weapons falling into the hands of criminal groups. It is also unlikely to make any dent in the demand for homemade guns. The availability and cheaper prices of these guns mean that the manufacturers will still find plenty of customers. While the weapons are not as sophisticated or durable as official guns, they have the added benefit of lacking serial numbers and are substantially cheaper."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"US-Mexico Cooperation Falters to Advantage of Gun Runners. Cooperation between Mexican and U.S. authorities on arms trafficking has dropped off in recent years, even as traffickers continue to move huge quantities of arms across the border while taking advantage of legal loopholes. Since Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in 2012, cooperation between the U.S. and Mexican authorities on ending arms trafficking has decreased, reported the Global Post. The Global Post cites a January 2016 United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that noted that in 2011, US officials evaluated 22,097 guns seized in Mexico, compared to just 15,142 in 2014. According to officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) this shift in the numbers does not necessarily mean that there are fewer guns being trafficked to Mexico. Instead, it likely points to a fluctuation in cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico. The GAO noted that in 2011, when the number of guns evaluated by the U.S. was the highest, the Mexican government had widely implemented a software program called Etrace which allows Mexican officials to enter information on seized weapons for U.S. officials to evaluate. However, in 2012, when Pena Nieto took office, he pulled access to the program for many Mexican officials. This was part of Pena Nieto's broader strategy to reevaluate law enforcement cooperation with the U.S. On the U.S. side, the GAO report also points to continued hesitation by U.S officials to collaborate with Mexican officials due to perceived corruption. Some analysts believe that the decrease in collaboration is a sign of lack of political will: ""I don't get any sense of 'the fierce urgency of now' from any of the parties on the Mexican or US side when it comes to dealing with the issue,"" Joy Olson, executive director of the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) told Global Post. Insight Crime Analysis Lack of political will and cooperation may be part of the reason that up to 85 percent of the 15 million guns in Mexico are illegal, but other factors also play a role. Legal loopholes make it easier for innovative traffickers to import guns. The GAO report details how gunrunners now legally buy firearm parts which they smuggle to Mexico and assemble there. Other reports have noted how loopholes in U.S. laws regarding foreign guns have allowed traffickers to move Romanian and Bulgarian weapons into Mexico. In addition, illegal trafficking from external providers is hardly the only source of weapons in Mexico. Mexico's legal arms imports grew by 331 percent over the last five years, compared to 2006-2010. Paulina Arriaga, the director of gun control advocacy group Desarma Mexico, told the Global Post that Mexican tracking of legal firearms is ""rudimentary"" at best, making it is easy for these legal weapons to slip into the illicit market."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Video Exposes Southern Cone Illicit Gun Trade. Footage shot using a hidden camera sheds light on the dynamics of the Southern Cone's illicit arms trade, showing how easy it is to purchase weapons at the tri-border area, where Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay meet. The video , titled ""Lawless Border,"" shows how easy it is to cross into Argentina from Brazil via the Bernardo de Irigoyen border crossing. A journalist working for a Brazilian television program makes the trip without any harassment from customs officials. (See video below) Just on the other side, he encounters illegal weapons vendors who operate just a few steps away from border and security checkpoints. Casually speaking on a sidewalk in plain public view, a gun seller asks what caliber of weapon the journalist is looking for, and is unfazed when asked for a .40 caliber pistol, 9mm pistol, or a .38 revolver. ""I have some, but I have to send for them,"" the seller says, adding that a 9mm pistol used by Argentina's armed forces costs about $820. A meeting is arranged for the next day, where the journalist finally sees the merchandise and given prices: a .38 caliber costs about $770, while a .32 caliber goes for around $590. The journalist also visits a store where ammunition is sold and is told he could buy 100 boxes of .38 caliber bullets, each one costing about $75. To cross back into Brazil, the journalist is instructed he'd simply need to put the gun ""in a plastic bag and walk across so as not to draw attention. If you cross here, no one will get suspicious."" The video is a rare look at how sellers, intermediaries, and buyers interact in the Southern Cone's illicit arms trade. The tri-border region, where Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay meet (and where this video was shot), is a major hub for all kinds of illicit goods, including weapons. Brazil is a prime destination for illegal weapons in the region, with arms trafficking networks working to feed the demand of criminal organizations like the First Capital Command (PCC) and Red Command (Comando Vermelho). Weapons are sourced from a variety of places , including Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. In many cases, the weapons are either apparently stolen or sold off by corrupt officials , drawing from military stockpiles. In one such illustrative case, on September 17, the Argentine military announced nine 9mm pistols had been stolen from a military base. This was the third such reported theft in 2015, with 26,000 9mm bullets and an anti-tank missile stolen earlier this year. Argentine military personnel have again come under suspicion."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Uruguayan Police Suspected of Selling Guns to Brazilian Gangs. Uruguay is investigating 20 police officers for the disappearance of some 200 firearms over the past two years, as evidence suggests the officers may have been involved in an arms trafficking ring that sold weapons to Brazilian criminal organizations. The officers, including a former police chief, are suspected of involvement in the disappearance of more than 200 firearms from police headquarters in Treinta y Tres, an eastern province that shares a maritime border with Brazil, reported El Observador. The investigation began in June, after Brazil's Federal Police arrested a suspected drug trafficker carrying a firearm that was traced back to the Uruguayan police force. Treinta y Tres' chief of police at the time, Tabare Gordiola, initially said that only eight weapons were unaccounted for in his department, but he has since been removed from his post and is now one of the officers under investigation. The 200 missing weapons began disappearing in 2010. The firearms, mostly semi-automatic pistols and revolvers, could fetch up to five times their retail price on the black market, according to Uruguayan daily El Pais. Sources close to the investigation told El Pais that investigators believed the police were involved in an arms trafficking network that sold weapons to Brazilian criminal groups. Interestingly, because arms trafficking is not a distinct crime under Uruguayan law, the police would only be charged with ""trafficking illicit contraband."" The case may increase concerns over the presence of Brazilian organized criminal groups in Uruguay. While it is one of Latin America's safest and least corrupt countries, Uruguay's Interior Ministry recently expressed concern that Brazil's security crackdown, coupled with relatively lax border control between the two countries, might lead Brazilian criminal groups to move to Uruguay in search of a safer area from which to operate. This is a phenomenon that has been seen in Paraguay , which Brazilian gangs use as a site of operations. The investigation comes at a time when anti-drug officials in Uruguay and the United States are concerned about the South American country's increasing importance to the regional drug trade, both as a consumer nation and as a transit point to the larger cocaine markets of Argentina and Brazil ."	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
"Smuggling Ammo from US to Mexico All Too Easy. A surge in the amount of ammunition seized at the Arizona-Mexico border suggests that traffickers may have found the perfect state to buy and smuggle bullets in bulk. According to the Arizona Republic , ammunition seizures along the state's border with Mexico have increased more than 125-fold since 2007. U.S. authorities have confiscated over 95,000 rounds so far this fiscal year, compared to just 760 rounds four years ago. The flood of bullets apparently pouring across the border may be a sign that U.S. agencies have become more effective at identifying and stopping smugglers. But it is also damning evidence that Arizona's weak gun laws are not only putting weapons into the hands of Mexican criminal groups, but may also be contributing to the gangs' munition supply. Ammunition regulation laws vary by state, and Arizona has next to none. Stores are not required to record mass purchases of ammunition, and there is no limit to the amount an individual can buy at one time. Under federal law, ammunition buyers are required to be U.S. citizens and have no criminal record, but store owners often fail to enforce this. It is impossible to say how many bullets sold in Arizona are taken to Mexico, let alone end up in the stockpiles of Mexican criminal gangs. Unlike guns, bullets have no serial numbers and are difficult to trace. But its safe to assume that for every thousand rounds of ammo seized at the border, thousands more make it into the hands of the gangs. Mexican groups have a special incentive to buy bullets in bulk. The weapons favored by groups like the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel -- including an AK-47 knock-off known as the ""cuerno de chivo"" -- are high-power assault weapons which can fire up to one full round with each pull of the trigger. Considering that bullets are expensive and difficult to obtain in Mexico, criminal groups which need to buy cheap bullets en masse find U.S. border states are the most convenient place to do so. The problem is not limited to Arizona. Texas has similarly weak regulations, and as a result, buyers can purchase hundreds of thousands of ammo rounds online, or buy in bulk at different stores on a weekly basis. Because Texas has two highways -- the 281 and the 77 -- which run from the Mexican border to the northernmost parts of the U.S., the state makes a convenient smuggling corridor for arms traffickers looking to buy ammunition in stores across the country. And like Arizona, there is a profileration of gun dealers along Texas' border, with at least 72 dealers in El Paso county alone , just over the border from Mexican murder capital Juarez. Because there are no legal requirements to report mass sales of ammunition, U.S. law enforcement agencies have little ability to identify and track suspicious purchases. This is basically the same problem facing agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) when it comes to breaking up gun trafficking networks. Earlier this year, the U.S. government tried to push through new regulations which would require stores to report when two or more semi-automatics are sold to a single purchaser within a five-day period. Predictably, the move met stiff opposition from the pro-gun lobby. Alongside the increasing flow of bullets from Arizona to Mexico, the state has registered a record amount of firearms sold this year. The Arizona Republic reports that an estimated 350,000 guns have been sold so far in 2011, a number which includes weapons bought from retailers, as well as estimates for weapons bought at gun shows or through private transactions, for which there are no official records.

"Chinese Mafia Moving Contraband Fish Costs Argentina Millions. Authorities in Argentina dismantled a ring of Chinese nationals who evaded millions of dollars in taxes and laundered money through fish export businesses, in a case that provides more evidence that Chinese crime groups of all stripes have found a foothold in the South American country. Authorities in Argentina arrested several members of a group accused of smuggling, money laundering and evading some $23 million in taxes between 2017 and 2019 through fish export businesses in Mar del Plata, an Atlantic coastal city. The companies would ""over-invoice operations among the companies to inflate costs, and under-invoice foreign trade operations,"" according to a press release by Argentina's Federal Tax Administration (Administracion Federal de Ingresos Publicos - AFIP). They also exported the fish to two companies in Uruguay at prices below market value, authorities said. The fish was then sold to clients in Brazil and China at above market price, allowing the firms to report lower revenue. An August 30 raid of several homes and offices across the country led to the seizure of cell phones, memory cards, and at least 10 types of currencies and passports belonging to Chinese nationals. As Chinese crime groups in Argentina grow in reach, authorities there have struggled with these mafias, whose insular communities, language barriers, and extensive contraband networks make them difficult to untangle. Chinese mafias have long demanded protection money from members of a Chinese community who run small supermarkets in cities across Argentina. Authorities have documented a number of cases where supermarket owners are threatened and attacked, for failure to pay. More recently, these mafias have targeted Argentine merchants operating in areas with a high presence of Chinese-owned businesses, indicating that the groups are expanding their rackets. While the extortion rings are vastly different than the illegal fish export businesses, both are examples of the difficulty Argentine authorities face in tackling these Chinese mafias. When Argentine authorities launched an investigation in 2016 into the largest Chinese crime group operating in the country, the Pixiu criminal gang, they had to enlist the help of an official from the Chinese embassy to listen in on the group and translate. Members of Argentina's large Chinese community are also reluctant to help in investigations, saying they are afraid of possible repercussions they might face if they are seen as working against the gangs, whose members live in the same areas, according to an Infobae report. Chinese groups are known to have bribed Argentine officials. A few months after the arrests of the Pixiu gang's leaders, it was discovered that the group was linked to Leonardo Javier Rende, then-head of Argentina's national migration commission, who was accused of accepting bribes in exchange for facilitating a human trafficking network run by Pixiu. Smuggling and tax evasion are also common crimes in Argentina, exacerbated by a lack of efficient controls and official corruption. What's more, Chinese crime groups are adept at moving contraband fish out of Latin America to China's large black markets, where traffickers in both regions facilitate the illegal trade."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"How Brazils Odebrecht Laundered Bribe Money. In this article -- the product of collaboration between IDL-Reporteros, Caretas, and La Prensa in Panama -- investigators analyze how corrupt officials from Brazilian firm Odebrecht S.A. allegedly laundered bribe money as part of the ongoing Petrobras scandal. Despite the simplicity suggested by its name, money laundering is a crime that has become more sophisticated and complex in recent decades, to the point of overcoming, for quite some time, the best efforts to combat it. In this age of information-driven journalism, a good hacker is sometimes the best friend of an investigative journalist. On the other side of the spectrum (or rather, of ethics), a good money launderer is the indispensable ally of the corrupt, especially if they are elites. This article originally appeared in IDL-Reporteros , and was translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission. Its views do not necessarily reflect those of InSight Crime. See Spanish original here. Therefore, knowledge of money laundering techniques and methods is essential in all major corruption cases. And in the case of the Lava Jato (""Car Wash"") scandal, the most significant corruption investigation in the history of Brazil (and, most likely, in Latin America), it is no coincidence the judge in the case, Sergio Moro, is an expert, having authored a book on the subject. The Three Levels of Laundering In its 205 pages of carefully organized evidence, the Brazilian Public Ministry's accusations against Odebrecht can also be read as an investigative text on how to discover and decipher a system of bribes designed to be virtually undetectable. Prosecutors faced the challenge of describing how Odebrecht covertly paid off three top executives of Petrobras for several years: Paulo Roberto Costa, Pedro Barusco, and Renato Duque. To be effective, bribery should seek to be undetectable and, above all, unprovable. As Brazilian federal investigators discovered, those involved in the Odebrecht case did this via a multi-layered system of international money laundering. According to prosecutors, the first layer was the ""use of bank accounts of Constructora Norberto Odebrecht S.A. and of other companies in its business group."" Those accounts included those at Swiss bank PKB Privatbank AG, registered in the name of several offshore companies, almost all of which were owned by Odebrecht. Other offshore companies included Smith & Nash Engineering Company INC, Golac Projects, and Arcadex Corp, among others. The second layer was the use of ""linked accounts,"" also created in the name of offshore companies, as was the case for Constructora Internacional del Sur, an offshore based in Panama (which will be discussed in further detail below). In the third layer, prosecutors found accounts ""whose economic beneficiaries are the corrupt Petrobras agents: Paulo Roberto [Costa], Renato Duque, and Pedro Barusco."" These three men used offshore accounts that, in several cases, were based in Panama, but held cash in other accounts in Switzerland or Monaco. The way in which these three levels interacted was anything but simple, as evidenced by the graphic below. The arrows show the movement of cash -- almost all in millions -- that Odebrecht companies moved to their offshore accounts. Afterwards, the money was moved to the ""linked"" accounts, before reaching those belonging to the three corrupt Petrobras officials. Prosecutors were able to determine with accuracy (and provide evidence in the indictment), that Odebrecht is the final owner of the offshore accounts involved in the first level of laundering. The Petrobras officials -- Costa, Barusco, and Duke -- are the final owners of the offshore accounts at the third level of money laundering. But what about the second level of money laundering -- the ""linked accounts,"" which do not belong to Odebrecht or to the Petrobras officials, but were the main means of concealing the cash? This is why it's worth examining the case of Panamanian company Constructora del Sur in detail. A Builder That Doesn't Build Several whistleblowers in the Odebrecht case have claimed to have received bribes from Odebrecht via Constructora Internacional del Sur. Odebrecht, in turn, emphatically denied any involvement with Constructora Internacional del Sur, claiming it had never made any payments to anyone from the corporation. Constructora Internacional del Sur was created by a notary deed on October 11, 2006, in Panama. With a modest capital amount of $10,000, it was structured like a typical offshore account. Less typical, however, was its choice of resident agent: a law firm called PMC International Legal Services. This switch of resident agents brought huge profits to Constructora Internacional del Sur, even though the construction company was not finishing more construction projects. As far as we know, they never placed one brick on top of another. One of the most notorious members of this firm is Ernesto Chong Coronado, a car racer linked to the so-called king of Colombian Ponzi schemes, David Murcia. When Murcia came under too much pressure in Colombia he moved operations to Panama, where he developed a relationship with Chong Coronado. According to a report by La Prensa de Panama, PMC was one of two companies that formed more than 200 corporations linked to Murica's pyramid scheme. In the end, Chong and Murcia ended up quarreling when the former accused the latter of having kept some of his most valuable assets. This included diamonds, a Ferrari, and a Lamborghini (which, amazingly, authorities repainted so that it looked like a Panamanian police car, making it perhaps the most expensive patrol car in the world). On July 21, 2009, the structure of Constructora Internacional del Sur underwent a fundamental change. That day, Cecilio Moreno Arosemena appeared before a notary. He was the representative of Constructora Internacional del Sur's new resident agent, Francisco Martinelli -- the beloved cousin of Panama's new president at the time (having taken office in July), Ricardo Martinelli. Francisco Martinelli was a member of another law firm Patton, Moreno & Asvat, which had become the new resident agent of Constructora Internacional del Sur. This switch of resident agents brought huge profits to Constructora Internacional del Sur, even though the construction company was not finishing more construction projects. As far as we know, they never placed one brick on top of another. Nevertheless, in a relatively short period of time -- particularly between the second half of 2009 and 2010 -- Constructora Internacional del Sur received more than $47 million from two offshore companies. According to Brazilian prosecutors, these companies belong to Odebrecht: Smith & Nash Engineering Company Inc., and Golac Projects and Construction Corp. At the same time, Constructora Internacional del Sur deposited more than $3 million in the European accounts of Panamanian offshore companies, and whose beneficiaries were the corrupt Petrobraus officials: Paulo Roberto Costa, Pedro Barusco, and Renato Duque. Both Costa and Barusco received more than $1 million each, while Barusco received $875,000. How can Odebrecht now justify its previous emphatic claim to have had no connection with Constructora Internacional del Sur? That is just one of the difficulties its team of lawyers will face. In Panamanian offshore companies, managers (or ""dignitaries"") of the company are employees of the law firm, or of the beneficiary of the offshore. They receive a generally modest payment for the use of their name. Francis ""Frankie"" Martinelli -- the cousin of the now former Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli and who acted on behalf of the resident agents of Constructora del Sur -- was fortunate enough to employ Rodny Soto Nunez as his driver. At one point, Rodney Soto charged at least $2.3 million for a private consultancy for a subcontractor of the Panama Metro, which Odebrecht built. As Frankie Martinelli and many others like him could explain, part of the so-called charm of offshore accounts is that what is officially charged on paper isn't necessarily what is paid out. Rodny Soto received the money from another company, Sofratesa, a contractor of the consortium led by Odebrecht. This contract with Sofratesa, for which Soto was so considerably compensated, meant ""offering secretarial services and knowledge of the Panamanian market"" according to research by La Prensa. However, $2.3 million does not seem to have changed much in Rodny Soto's life, because when La Prensa of Panama found him, he was working a new job, managing heavy transport. ""I wish I had that money,"" he told the La Prensa reporter. As Frankie Martinelli and many others like him could explain, part of the so-called charm of offshore accounts is that what is officially charged on paper isn't necessarily what is paid out. After its feverish activity in secretive banking, Constructora Internacional del Sur was dissolved on August 15, 2014, as the Lava Jato investigation gained momentum. A few days later, Paulo Roberto Costa agreed to become a protected witness. The paperwork for the official dissolution of Constructora Internacional del Sur states that the company dissolved ""given that their objectives had been achieved."" About that there was no doubt. * This article originally appeared in IDL-Reporteros , and was translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission.

"Mile-High Money Laundering Network Dismantled in Colombia. Authorities in Colombia have dismantled an international money laundering network that allegedly used glamorous flight attendants to smuggle huge amounts of illicit cash on behalf of Mexican and Colombian drug trafficking groups. Authorities recently arrested 13 suspects in four different provinces of Colombia, including five flight attendants working for the Avianca Airlines, on charges of money laundering, illicit enrichment, and criminal conspiracy, reported Semana. The sting was part of a year-long investigation carried out by officials in the United States, Colombia, Mexico, and Spain that has so far resulted in 58 arrests, including 24 flight attendants, reported El Tiempo. According to El Tiempo, alleged members of the money laundering network have links to the heads of Colombian criminal groups the Rastrojos and Urabenos, as well as the jailed leader of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. It is presumed the money was being laundered for these organizations. Prosecutors said the flight attendants were found with $5.4 million and 1.2 million euros hidden in their luggage or strapped onto their bodies, reported the AFP. These figures, however, may just be scratching the surface of the scope of this international criminal network. Colombia's Deputy Attorney General, Jorge Perdomo, said the structure is believed to have laundered up to $250 million per year, according to a separate El Tiempo report. The amount of money that was allegedly being laundered suggests this network's modus operandi may not be an outlier. This case certainly fits into a larger pattern seen throughout the region of criminal groups opting to move illicit cash in bulk instead of relying on more traditional money laundering techniques like shell companies and the banking sector. Ecuador, for example, saw a major jump in the amount of cash being smuggled through its borders between 2008 and 2012. According to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, criminal organizations are increasingly turning to bulk cash smuggling in response to tightened anti-money laundering regulations that have made laundering illicit cash via the financial sector more difficult. In fact, an unidentified US official indicated to El Tiempo that cash smuggling has potentially become as profitable as the traditional money laundering methods. ""The vast majority of money laundered by mafias is moved via bank accounts and can be traced using financial documents,"" the official said. ""But this [cash smuggling] method appears to be just as lucrative."" Using flight attendants to transfer cash shipments also carries a number of specific advantages for criminal groups. In addition to the speed with which the money can cross borders, flight attendants are not subject to the same security checks as passengers. In addition, the attendants who were recently arrested reportedly used a special wrapping paper that blocked the X-ray scanners from detecting the illegitimate cash."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"US Sentences Mexico Businessman in Zetas Money Laundering Case. The United States sentenced a Mexico businessman for laundering millions of dollars in drug proceeds for the Zetas criminal organization, concluding a long and cumbersome judicial process that demonstrates the challenges of prosecuting money laundering cases. Francisco Antonio Colorado-Cessa was sentenced in an Austin, Texas, courthouse to 20 years in federal prison on charges of money laundering and bribery, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced in a March 23 press release. In December 2015, a federal jury convicted Colorado-Cessa of laundering millions of drug dollars for the Zetas by purchasing, breeding and training race horses in the United States. In January 2016, the Mexican businessman was convicted of conspiracy to bribe a judge with $1.2 million in order to receive a lower sentence. Colorado-Cessa was first found guilty in 2013 on similar charges, but in May 2015 the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned his money laundering conviction due to a technical error in the legal proceedings. In October, the same appeals court ruled Colorado-Cessa could retract his guilty plea for bribery and ordered a retrial. ""Today's resentencing of Francisco Colorado-Cessa to 20 years in prison is confirmation that the American public is steadfast in their conviction that he was properly found guilty of money laundering and bribery the first time,"" said Special Agent William Cotter of the Internal Revenue Service. US prosecutors have also alleged that in 2004, a leader of the Zetas provided Colorado-Cessa with a multi-million dollar loan to help his oil services business ADT Petroservicios. The company, which was blacklisted by the US Treasury Department in August 2012, has reportedly received over $100 million in contracts from Mexico's state-run oil giant Pemex. Insight Crime Analysis The legal wrangling surrounding Colorado-Cessa's multiple trials illustrates the challenges involved in prosecuting money laundering cases. Despite the overwhelming amount of evidence and the high profile nature of a scandal that was deeply embarrassing to the US and Mexico, it took prosecutors nearly four years to conclude the case -- that is, assuming there are no further appeals or overturned convictions. Colorado-Cessa was a natural fit to act as the legal operator for the Zetas' money laundering scheme. His company's contracts with Pemex were a big advantage to a criminal organization that has benefited greatly from oil theft over the years. And the Zetas had shown signs of moving beyond simply tapping oil pipelines, such as when members of the group were found operating a Pemex-owned well in 2010. But Colorado-Cessa gave them something better: a legal avenue to the spigot via contractor. That, however, was a different era in Mexico's underworld. The arrests stemming from the horse racing scandal were just one of several major blows inflicted on the Zetas around that time, who also saw several leaders either captured or killed by Mexican security forces. Although the criminal group remains operational at least in name, they are increasingly fragmented and no longer represent the regional threat they once did."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Case Shows Role of Legal Exporters in Colombias Illegal Gold Trade. One of Colombia's largest gold export companies is under investigation for money laundering and ties to narco-paramilitaries, shining a light on the key role of legal companies in the illegal mining trade. According to a recent report by El Tiempo , 63 former associates, clients or employees of John Uber Hernandez Santa -- the owner of Goldex, Colombia's second largest gold export company -- are currently under investigation for reporting false exports and laundering money. Hernandez has admitted buying gold from ex-convict Jairo de Jesus Rendon Herrera, alias ""German Monsalve,"" brother of the founder of Colombia's prinicipal criminal group the Urabenos, the now incarcerated Daniel Rendon, alias ""Don Mario,"" and former paramilitary leader Freddy Rendon Herrera, alias ""El Aleman."" Hernandez told El Tiempo he purchased nearly $7 million in gold from Jairo Rendon and businesses linked to his family between 2007 and 2009, although he said Rendon had not been accused of any illegal activity at the time. Hernandez claims he ended his business relationship with Rendon in 2009 when he found out about his ties to criminal activity. According to El Tiempo, the last month Goldex registered purchases from Rendon -- July 2009 -- was the same month in which Rendon handed himself in to authorities in the United States. Rendon later spent over two years in prison in the United States after being convicted of money laundering. In September last year, WRadio reported Hernandez had been brought in for questioning over his company's activities, but he told El Tiempo this was not the case and he had just been helping investigators with their enquires. The gold industry plays an important role in Colombia's criminal underworld, serving as both a source of funding for criminal groups and a means of laundering money. Illegal armed groups, including the Urabenos, are heavily involved in gold mining operations , exerting control in mining areas through extortion or by directly running operations in nearly half of Colombia's municipalities. Extracted gold is sold to exporters by ""compras de oro"" -- gold buyers -- many of which have been linked to money laundering. The export companies play a crucial role in the illegal mining chain by introducing the gold to the legal market, at which point its illegal roots become increasingly difficult to trace. Money laundering through the gold industry often involves false accounts of exports, which have led to huge spikes in reported gold sales that do not appear to coincide with real extraction figures. Authorities believe the gold industry in Colombia has been used to launder a total of $4 billion. Goldex has exported 40 tons of gold -- worth approximately $1.3 billion -- to the United States over the past five years, and if investigations into the company's business dealings demonstrate criminal activity it could mark a major step towards tackling the role of legal exporters in laundering illegal gold."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Why Mexicos New Dirty Money Push Is Not a Game-Changer. Mexico's president has sent new reforms to Congress aimed at cracking down on money laundering, but the measures' potential impact on organized crime is uncertain. As reported by the Associated Press , last week President Enrique Pena Nieto sent a proposal to a judicial subcommittee in Mexico's lower house of Congress, which would give authorities more leeway to investigate and prosecute those who manage assets on behalf of members of organized crime. Should the bill become law, such individuals, often referred to as ""prestanombres"" or ""testaferros"" in Spanish, would be eligible for prosecution under money laundering statutes. Furthermore, on June 17, as Vanguardia reported , a stronger anti-laundering law came on the books, which gives the Finance Ministry greater resources in monitoring the entry of foreign currencies into the Mexican financial system. Such transfers are vital for transnational drug shipments, for which US dollars are the typical medium of exchange. Prior to Pena Nieto's inauguration in December, Presidente Felipe Calderon pursued a handful of different measures seeking to limit the ability of organized crime groups to introduce illicit profits into the legitimate financial system. In 2010, his government imposed new restrictions on the amount of cash that could be moved through currency exchanges, and implemented new due diligence requirements for financial institutions with regard to their customers. Calderon's government also enacted a new asset seizure law in 2009 that was designed to make it easier for authorities to confiscate goods purchased with the proceeds of illegal activities. [ See InSight Crime's complete coverage of money laundering in Latin America ] Pena Nieto's bill addresses a perceived flaw in Mexico's recent approach to organized crime, one that many critics have touched: the absence of a serious plan to combat gangs' finances. Reversing the lack of interest in the criminals' financial networks is one idea that enjoys widespread support in the political system, with virtually all of the candidates in last year's presidential election voicing support for ideas like those proposed by Pena Nieto. Unfortunately, it is often easier to pass such laws than it turns out to be to prosecute money laundering cases against members of organized crime. As InSight Crime reported last week, authorities have launched prosecutions based on the asset seizure law on just 29 occasions in the three years since it has been enacted. And while this may be a particularly pronounced problem in Mexico, it is an issue everywhere. The US government has become infamous for its unwillingness or inability to regularly prosecute banks that violate laundering regulations, even while it goes after the criminals who use those banks. Other countries in the region, such as Argentina , have also shown that prosecuting money launderers is not easy or politically popular. While difficulty should not be an excuse for inaction, the persistent obstacles to an effective anti-money laundering regime throughout the hemisphere reflects the inevitable shortcomings of this approach to organized crime and represents the top reason why this new law is not a game-changer. In essence, there is simply not the will to carry out these laws, especially as they relate to the prosecution of the world's top financial institutions. The cases brought against HSBC in the United States and Argentina are perfect illustrations of this unwillingness. Furthermore, the advocates of using money laundering statutes to attack groups like the Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas rarely flesh out exactly how it would help. Money laundering laws are extremely useful for exposing dirty politicians with hidden offshore funds, such as those of Augusto Pinochet in Riggs Bank , or for breaking down terrorist financing networks, as was the case with Al Qaeda after 9-11. However, organized crime groups present fundamentally different targets than either of the above. For politicians, tracking their dirty money can expose them as criminals, allowing voter outcry to run them out of public life. In this sense, depriving them of their ill-gotten wealth is a secondary benefit, with depriving them of a public post being the principal gain. But Mexican drug traffickers are already exposed as criminals, which is why they live underground. Identifying a laundering network at the service of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman tells us little that we didn't already know about him. For terrorists, the financial network exists to facilitate violence, so cracking down on the money limits their ability to kill civilians. For drug traffickers, the calculus is reversed: the violence is commited to facilitate the profits. As a result, making it significantly harder for them to launder money would not limit their ability to perpetrate acts of violence (at least, not in the short term). In fact, reducing gangsters' access to laundered money could have the perverse effect of encouraging them to compensate for their smaller effective profit margins with a greater volume of activity: more trafficking, more extortion, more kidnapping, and more robbery. In other words, a stronger focus on gangs' financial networks -- even putting aside the difficulty in implementing such a strategy -- would not necessarily lead to a public security benefit. Nonetheless, measures like those pursued by the Pena Nieto and Calderon governments remain popular, and we will likely see more of them. In and of itself, there is nothing wrong with this, but such changes are unlikely to be the leading edge of a more effective violence reduction strategy."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"In Panama, the Money Always Stays Clean. Panama is the financial and commercial center of Central America, but also, historically, it is where drug traffickers launder money. Real estate, businesses and even greeting cards are used by the traffickers to confuse authorities. How do they manage to get away with it? The story sounds like a gangster film. A half hour later -- half an hour of lies, really -- the visitor paused and smiled at him. ""You already noticed that I don't know anything about banks, right?"" he said. Cautiously, the boss nodded. ""I wanted to meet you because I know it was you,"" said the visitor. The boss was stunned. The steak filet that he was eating grew cold on his plate and became stiff, just like his arms -- stiff like rods of steel. ""What?"" he asked. ""What did I do? What are you talking about?"" ""The $600,000 that you took. That money was mine,"" the visitor said passively. The boss understood. ""We had been following those people for a long time,"" the boss says now, years after the encounter, while sitting in the same shopping center in Panama City where the meeting took place. ""We had intelligence reports saying that they were moving money and drugs. They were Colombians. When we finally took them down, I had to leave. We caught them with everything: $600,000 in one room."" The money was being stored while the organization erased the traces of drug trafficking; lawyers, financiers and bankers would have been in charge of integrating it into legal markets and closing the drug trafficking ring. *This article originally ran in Domingo El Universal and was translated and reprinted with permission from the authors. Read the original here. They sat staring at each other for a long time. The boss does not remember how long, but in any case they were the longest seconds of his life. ""If you're going to kill me,"" he said, ""those two over there are going to take care of you."" He was talking about his bodyguards, who stood a couple meters from them. ""No, no, if that were the case, I wouldn't be sitting here,"" said the visitor. ""I really just came to admit that in this case there was no corruption. I know that. That's part of the game: sometimes you win, sometimes you lose."" ***** About all he remembers about that night is that it was late. He and his bodyguard had come to have dinner at a shopping center near the canal when the visitor, a middle-aged Colombian man, had approached them in the hallway. The boss says he was in shock at the time and to this day he cannot drum up a portrait of what the man looked like. ""Did he have long or short hair? Light or dark? Thick eyebrows, big hands?"" The boss only remembers the visitor's composure, and the details he gave him about the boss' personal life. ""He had done a full investigation into my life. He knew my brand of car, where I lived, where I ate I didn't know when he was going to pull a gun on me."" The incident happened just a few meters from where our interview was taking place. The boss was driving towards the old Financial Analysis Unit (UAF) of the Panamanian government, an entity in charge of investigating money laundering cases. He asked to remain anonymous. Under his command, UAF agents brought down a lot of operations and structures tied to organized crime, and he does not want anyone to be able to identify him. ""That day I suddenly realized I was vulnerable,"" he says. As the moments passed, and the boss realized that no one was shooting at him, he relaxed a bit. Although the visitor was subtle, the boss noticed that he wanted to put him on his payroll. ""He had come to bribe me. He wanted me to stay right where I was (among the leadership of the unit) and pass him information. He talked about himself; that's how I know he was one of the big ones -- he didn't speak in third person, like a messenger, he talked about himself."" The boss did not understand why the man was there, why he had not sent an emissary, and he said as much. ""Why are you taking such a big risk?"" he remembered asking him. The visitor laughed. When the visitor made his last bribe offer, the boss made a decision. ""Look, I'm pissing myself with fear, but since you've spoken so sincerely, I will too."" And he told him no. The drug lord left and the boss was left to stew. His work was delicate, and he knew that. He investigated money laundering cases involving tens of millions of dollars each year in Panama, an important territory for organized crime. He knew, as he explained later, that, ""while the government is getting dressed, the criminals are already ready."" This is what had happened months earlier in the city. The antinarcotics unit of the Attorney General's Office and the now-extinct Technical Judicial Police (PTJ) had dismantled a group made up of Colombians, Panamanians and Mexicans that moved cocaine from South America to Central America. The authorities seized three tons of cocaine and put 11 members of the organization in jail. But the operation ended badly -- one of the heads of the PTJ died of poisoning and the antinarcotics prosecutor, Patricio Candanedo, resigned months later. Then the boss had found the operations room of a group of Colombians and had confiscated the $600,000. Although he still does not know why, the only bad thing that happened that day was that his dinner got cold. ***** Rosendo Miranda received us in his office, on the umpteenth floor of the umpteenth skyscraper in one of the city's wealthy neighborhoods. Miranda, who was the antinarcotics prosecutor between 1995 and 2005, pursued, like the current head of the UAF, drug trafficking funds in Panama and the financial structures that laundered this money. The lawyer understands that the biggest problem for the authorities here is the volume of financial and commercial activity happening in the country, a facade used by drug traffickers to cover up their real business. Elegant and concise, Miranda has a certain logic. ""Drug traffickers see it as a business,"" he said. ""Forget for a minute that cocaine or marijuana are illicit substances; pretend that they are legal. From a marketing point of view, what countries would you choose so that your product would most quickly reach your consumer market? Are you going to go to Nicaragua, which has no infrastructure? Are you going to go to Guatemala? No Of course not!"" The same thing happens with the money. The Panamanian economy grew more than 10 percent last year, the highest rate of growth in Latin America. The Colon Free Trade Zone -- the second largest tax free trade area in the world after Hong Kong -- moved $30 billion in that same period of time and provided jobs for 30,000 people. The famous Panama Canal connects two oceans in just an hour and a half. Such commercial movement creates good opportunities for legal commerce, but also for illegal commerce. ""It's always been this way,"" Miranda explained. ""Historically, there were the famous Portobello ferries in the colonial period; all of the gold that came out of South America passed through here and was sent to Spain. Panama is an attractive country, both for legal and illegal reasons."" Miranda recalled a case that occurred during his years working for the Attorney General's Office, an investigation that began in Canada, moved to Panama, and ended at a chain of household appliance stores in Colombia. ""The Canadian authorities had been monitoring a group that distributed drugs in Toronto, called the 'Angels of Death' or something like that,"" he said. ""The guys ran into problems when they went to change their Canadian dollars for American money and in this way send the money back to the distributor. What did Canada do? They opened a money exchange run by police. They gave them facilities in which to change their dollars and opened an account for them in New York. So the guys arrived with their Canadian dollars and the police changed them for New York bank checks."" The criminal structure ran a cover operation registered in the name of a frontman in the Colon Free Trade Zone and another in Maicao, Colombia. The checks came to the Panamanian business, which then gave loans to the Colombian business. Since the checks were backed by a New York bank, nobody suspected anything. ""Using this strategy, the police were able to see that the criminals sent $36 million through Panama,"" Miranda said. ""The investigations later carried out in Colombia showed, moreover, that Pacho Herrera's group -- a Cali Cartel leader -- set up a chain of household appliance stores, and that the other structure was involved in that as well. It was a very sophisticated case."" ***** In the La Joyita prison, on the outskirts of the capital, Jose Nelson Urrego is serving time for buying an island with drug trafficking money. In 2007, Urrego was sentenced to seven years for money laundering and buying properties with illicit money, among them the Chapera Island, located in the Pearl Islands in the Panamanian Pacific. The judicial report from the Judicial Investigation Unit states that he at one time managed over $25 million in ill-gotten proceeds. Urrego walked from his cell slowly, dressed in shorts and a yellow t-shirt. He approached the visiting area, a small section with plastic chairs, and sat down next to one of his lawyers, who, after dozens of meetings in prison, had essentially become his partner. He has a wide nose, big ears that stick out, and a soft voice. His eyes were tired and sad. A medical report from the prison says Urrego suffers from depression. Local press reported that Urrego was a member of the Norte del Valle Cartel, and was involved in drug trafficking since the 1980s. In a book titled Colombia: The Cocaine Cowboys, Colombian journalist Fabio Castillo names Urrego on a couple of occasions as the coordinator of cocaine flights to the United States, and as the owner of a hotel used as cover in the San Andres Island in the Colombian Caribbean. The first time he was arrested, authorities believed it to be ""the capture of the last great capo, the biggest money launderer and one of the richest men in the world."" That was in 1998 and he was in prison for three years. He was sentenced for illicit enrichment, but the drug trafficking charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. ""My fortune comes from a ranch that I inherited in the 1980s. I've always told the truth. I was persecuted,"" Urrego told us in his broken, cracked voice. He says he did know major drug traffickers; FARC guerrillas who walked through his family's properties when he was a kid, and corrupt generals. The latter, he says, sat in the VIP area of a nightclub that he ran, where they closed deals with drug lords. According to Urrego, he was arrested because they wanted to silence him. After he was set free, Urrego wanted a change of scenery and in 2001 went to Panama. The country was undergoing a serious economic crisis. He thought that it was a good opportunity to buy properties at a low price and do some business. He began to take in revenue from the Chapera Island, a paradise with lush vegetation and white sandy beaches, which he had purchased for just under $1.5 million. The producers of the famous television program Survivor decided to film some episodes there. For the rights to film on his beaches, Urrego got around $60,000 per month. The business broke down in 2007, when they arrested him. ""It was a conspiracy,"" he reiterated, more forcefully. ""Lewis Navarro [the former vice-president of Panama] met with me two times to tell me that he wanted to buy the island, that he had a special affection for it because he used to go there when he was young, and I refused."" Navarro has always denied that these encounters occurred or that he personally knew Urrego. ""Who are they going to believe?"" the Colombian said, tears falling down his face. ""But I am going to fight to get my island back."" For the moment, instead of reality show contestants, members of the Panamanian Air Force, which opened its first Pacific base in 2009, walk along the island's beaches. Their objective is to guard the Pearl Islands, which they say is used by US-bound drug traffickers. ***** In El Renacer, another prison on the outskirts of the capital, Manuel Antonio Noriega, the dictator who governed Panama from 1983 until 1989, when the United States invaded the country and arrested him, is held prisoner. The former general has spent the past 24 years in prison, first in the United States, where he was sentenced for drug trafficking, then in France for money laundering, and finally, for the past year and a half, in his own country, for multiple homicides during his reign. Noriega, now a sickly 80-year-old man who spends his days between his cell and the hospital, is in great part responsible for the fame Panama gained as a money laundering hotspot. The French authorities discovered that he had received millions of dollars from Colombia's Medellin Cartel, which in the 1980s operated on Panamanian territory with total impunity. In general, all of the Colombian organizations did. Men with suitcases stuffed with cash came to the central bank and, with few questions asked, opened accounts with exorbitant amounts of money. Now, even with the cash-hungry dictator in jail and a number of new monetary controls and regulatory measures that they have put in place since, there is a certain resignation that in Panama -- a regional financial center and a jumping off point for international commerce -- money laundering will always exist. ""There is no country that is free of money laundering, and much less so a country like ours, which has geographical and commercial characteristics that make the country fertile terrain. These factors predispose us, or make us more vulnerable to these activities,"" explained Javier Caraballo, a Panamanian antinarcotics prosecutor with a broad complexion, round face and shaved head. Caraballo said the bank's security standards have improved lately, but that drug traffickers have become more sophisticated. If anyone wants to open an important account in any Panamanian bank, the first thing the bank will do is open an investigation to verify that the future client does not have a criminal record. In the case of Urrego, the prosecutor said, a banker contracted by the Colombian managed to scrub all but a 75-day sentence from his criminal record. The bank did not find any other juridical impediments to opening the account. ""In drug trafficking there is a great specialization of roles,"" the prosecutor said. ""It is difficult to find one singular group that dedicates itself to both drug trafficking and money laundering. Even among the money launderers, there are specializations -- the group that introduces the money in cash and buys luxury items or properties is one; then there is another group dedicated to the more sophisticated part. This includes investors, lawyers, bankerspeople who know the system."" For the authorities, the critical moment is when the cash is converted into virtual money or a material good. ""The majority of our successful cases are cracked when they are still in the first phase,"" the prosecutor said. Several months before we spoke to him, the police discovered $2.6 million in cash in a luxury apartment occupied by a group of Colombians. Authorities later discovered another four luxury apartments that had been acquired with drug trafficking money by the same organization. It was a typical case of an organization that attempted to launder money through the purchase of properties. In the later stages of the laundering process, Caraballo said, ""following the money trail is extremely difficult. We have had cases in which the only limit is your imagination."" ***** While the government gets dressed, the criminals have already left, the UAF boss recalled as he played with his cell phone. Maybe prevention works, but the criminal organizations learn from their mistakes, and the laws, and they get better. The boss was thinking of his visitor, the Colombian drug lord, who was not complaining about losing his $600,000 but trying to rectify the situation by bribing the boss, getting him on his payroll. ""The game is the game,"" the boss said stoically. ""It's true. It's a game."" For him, the main problem in fighting drug trafficking and money laundering is the double standards of all the actors. ""When the DEA [US Drug Enforcement Administration] hits one guy, another benefits. And then vice versa, and that's how it always is. It is truly perverse. If the big countries really wanted to combat this, we would all be speaking the same language, but we're not,"" he said Looking up at the highest floor of the complex, the boss prepared to leave. There were still some questions, the majority about his recent past. What did a professional like him do with his life after investigating such sophisticated criminal tactics? What did he do with all the information accumulated during all those years? Quickly, the chief whispered just before he left: ""If you get out of this, you get out. If you want to stay in it, you have to be on the other side. Look at the fact that a lot of DEA agents, when they retire, open consultancy firms. Who do you think their clients are?""

"Mexican, Colombian Criminal Organizations Present in Uruguay?Colombian and Mexican drug traffickers are likely using Uruguay for money laundering, according to a United States report, underscoring the country's growing appeal for international criminals. Uruguay is ""vulnerable"" to money laundering partly because of a ""highly dollarized economy"", according to the State Department's 2013 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report , noting around 75 per cent of deposits and 50 per cent of credits are made in US dollars. Some laundered money is thought to be linked to drug trafficking organizations, among them Colombian and Mexican criminal gangs, according to Uruguayan officials. Responding to the report on March 13, Defense Minister Eleuterio Fernandez Huidobro claimed legalizing all drugs would be the best way to deal with the money laundering problem. The report, released on March 5, also cited the lack of restrictions on capital moving through the bank system as a factor contributing to the circulation of illicit funds. ""Porous borders"" with Brazil and Argentina and the existence of 13 Free Trade Zones within the country also facilitated the the movement of contraband and counterfeit goods, it said. The government has proposed a bill legalizing marijuana, though it is facing opposition from a majority of the population. Uruguay has historically had some of the lowest crime rates in Latin America, but in recent years it has been hit by the international drugs trade. Its geographical position between the two major Latin American drugs markets of Brazil and Argentina, combined with its dollarized economy and loose visa and residence requirements, create a welcoming environment for international criminals. Interior Minister Eduardo Bonomi warned of the internationalization of organized crime in the country in 2010, indicating the presence of drug trafficking groups from Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. Similar concerns over the expansion of organized crime were expressed in 2012. Officials said that Brazilian drug traffickers could move south as their own government cracked down on favela gangs, and police investigated reports that drug trafficking organizations were increasingly using Uruguay for cocaine processing. Battles between local gangs for control of domestic markets has driven up violence, with the country's homicide rate almost doubling from 2011 to 2012 and continuing to rise in 2013. Dollarized economies, porous borders, and free movement of capital are all factors that helped make Ecuador and Panama hot-spots for organized crime. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) uses both countries for refuge, strategic planning and the movement of drugs and arms. International criminal groups take advantage of Ecuador's extremely lax visa regulations to traffic people to the United States, as well as maintaining drug routes through the country. With a similar set of conditions in place, Uruguay could become another regional hub for organized crime operations."	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
"Sinaloa Cartel Bought Narco Plane Via HSBC Bank. The Sinaloa Cartel reportedly used its HSBC bank accounts to transfer money for the purchase of a turboprop aircraft, painting a picture of the kind of financial transactions the cartel was able to carry out, thanks to lax international banking controls. According to a report by Mexico's Attorney General's Office which is apparently based partly on Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) findings and was seen by national newspaper El Universal, the Sinaloa Cartel bought the Super King 200 aircraft in 2007. It was later seized by Mexican authorities in December 2007 in the capital of Morelos state, in central Mexico. At the time the security forces said it had been used to transport a nearly two ton cocaine shipment from Venezuela to Mexico. The dollars used to purchase the plane were originally deposited by two front companies -- Grupo Rahero SC and Grupo ETPB -- in two HSBC accounts in the Cayman Islands. The cash was then transferred to another US-registered company, Insured Aircraft Title Service Inc., in Oklahoma City. HSBC has faced an in-depth investigation into how its lax regulations allowed Mexican criminal groups like the Sinaloa Cartel to launder billions of dollars. According to El Universal, documents presented to the federal court in the Eastern District of New York, which is handling the lawsuit against the British bank, include a particularly damning affirmation by HSBC's Mexico CEO. The CEO reportedly says he has heard a recording of a drug trafficker calling HSBC Mexico ""the best place to launder money."" The purchase of the aircraft later seized in Morelos is just one example of the transactions that the Sinaloa Cartel were likely able to carry out, thanks to the bank's weak enforcement of regulations. El Universal reports that the aircraft was one of 13 purchased by the Sinaloa Cartel, used to ship cocaine between South and Central America. The cartel ended up transferring close to $13 million to 14 aircraft companies based in the US. The HSBC lawsuit recently culminated with a $1.9 billion settlement ."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Colombia Failing to Protect Venezuela Children from Sexual Exploitation. A ring that sexually exploited minors from Venezuela has been dismantled in Colombia, but this only further highlights the vulnerability of migrants in the country and the apparent inability of Colombian authorities to combat these networks. On October 7, ten people from a gang known as ""La Mona"" were arrested, and Colombian and Venezuelan minors between the ages of 14 and 17 were rescued in raids across the Caribbean department of La Guajira, reported El Heraldo. The group reportedly drugged the minors, dressed them up and then forced them to prostitute themselves for 60,000 pesos (about $17). According to police, the gang lured Venezuelan children living in poverty with promises of money, lodging and food in the towns of Riohacha, Maicao, Fonseca and San Juan de Cesar, all in La Guajira. They were then driven to different hotels to meet clients. Although Colombia is known as a popular destination for sexual trafficking of minors, its conviction rate for such crimes has been weak. Of 85,000 investigations into reports of child sexual abuse between 2005 and 2018, only 6,116 ended in convictions. Hundreds of migrant children from Venezuela have fallen prey to criminal gangs in Colombia and been used for sexual exploitation. In April 2018, the Colombian Family Welfare Institute (Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar - ICBF) reported that over 400 Venezuelan minors had been sexually exploited in Colombia, including 159 of them who were are under five years old. Cases of Venezuelan children being exploited are being registered across Colombia and are no longer confined to border areas such as La Guajira. Last July, a criminal gang was brought down after luring teenage girls from Venezuela and sexually exploiting them in the Colombian city of Cartagena. In the case of Colombia, impunity in these cases remains high , despite the fact that over 1.5 million Venezuelans have now entered the country as refugees. And Colombian children are at risk too. One hotspot for such exploitation is the Medellin-Bogota highway along which dozens of underage girls are forced into sexual exploitation. Although a number of victims have come forward to denounce their abusers helped by local associations, authorities have found it difficult to prosecute these cases. More than 100 new cases of child sexual exploitation were filed with authorities every month between January 2013 and July 2018. And the situation is getting worse, with the number of reported cases having tripled in the last five years."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Argentina Follows the Money in Human Trafficking Investigations. Argentine prosecutors are pursuing money laundering investigations into alleged human trafficking organizations suspected of hiding millions of dollars in illicit profits. A report from the Argentine Prosecutor's Office for Economic and Money Laundering Crimes (Procuraduria de Criminalidad Economica y Lavado de Activos - PROCELAC) indicates multiple ongoing investigations into the money laundering activities of human trafficking organizations suspected of laundering nearly $9.3 million, reported La Nacion. The report contends that illicit funds, generated primarily by sex trafficking operations, were invested in casinos, construction projects, and other businesses, as well as used to buy luxury cars and gold bars. Prosecutor Carlos Gonella told La Nacion that, ""As in all organized crime, you have to attack the profits of the organization. Prison time for the guilty is important, but going after their money is critical to ending this type of crime."" Gonella noted that the investigations are the result of cooperation between PROCELAC and the Prosecutor's Office for Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Procuraduria de Trata y Explotacion de Personas - PROTEX). Among the networks being investigated is the well known ""Clan Ale,"" a suspected criminal organization best known for its alleged role in the 2002 disappearance of trafficking victim Marita Veron, whose mother would go on to lead an internationally recognized fight against human trafficking in Argentina. These latest investigations may mark a shift in tactics as authorities try to combat Argentina's reputation as a regional trafficking hub. While the number of investigations related to human trafficking charges has risen in recent years, conviction rates remain low. Pursuing money laundering charges against suspected these groups could ultimately prove more effective as a prosecuting mechanism since securing eyewitnesses is a difficult task for any justice system seeking to take down sex trafficking rings. Since 2010, Argentina has been categorized as a ""tier two"" country, according to the US State Department's annual Trafficking in Person's Report, an upgrade from its previous designation as ""tier two watch list."" The 2015 report states that, ""The Government of Argentina does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so."" The International Labor Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations, has reported estimates suggesting that forced labor generates global annual revenues of nearly $150 billion. Two-thirds of that estimated revenue are thought to be connected to forced commercial sexual exploitation, with the remaining third being connected to forced commercial labor exploitation."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Mexico, Haiti Have Highest Numbers of Modern Slaves In the Americas. The Global Slavery Index has identified Mexico, Haiti, and Brazil as the countries with the highest number of people subjected to modern slavery in the Americas, partly due to the criminal groups in these countries who exploit children and other vulnerable populations. According to the 2014 Global Slavery Index , which is produced by the Walk Free Foundation , 3.6 percent of the estimated 35.8 million people living in some form of modern slavery are in the Americas. The report identified Haiti as the country in the region with the highest percentage of its population in slave-like conditions, with an estimated 237,700 people deprived of their freedom. According to the Index, Mexico is home to the greatest number of people living in slave-like conditions, with over 260,000 individuals subjected to some form of modern slavery, followed by Haiti, Brazil, and Colombia, as indicated in the graphic below. There are several ways that organized crime plays a role in subjecting vulnerable populations -- including children and undocumented migrants -- to slavery. In Mexico, cartels use children to carry out illegal activities including drug trafficking, surveillance, and targeted assassinations. A senior advisor on human rights from Refugees International told InSight Crime in July that an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 children have been recruited by criminal organizations in the country, and that many are used to guide migrants across the border into the United States. Undocumented migrants are also vulnerable to exploitation in Mexico. Criminal groups have allegedly enslaved migrants and other individuals in labor camps where they are forced to commit murders, process drugs, construct tunnels, serve as lookouts, and work as sex slaves. Mexican criminal groups are also heavily involved in human trafficking for sexual exploitation, with 70 percent of sex trafficking cases reported to the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women and Girls in Latin America and the Caribbean (CATW-LAC) attributed to gangs. Criminal groups also play a role in exploiting children in Brazil, according to the Global Slavery Index. Gangs in Brazil drug and recruit children to torture and kill their enemies, since minors receive shorter prison sentences than adult gang members. The exploitation of undocumented migrants is also a major problem in Brazil, particularly in the garment industry. According to the report, about half of the 100,000 Bolivian immigrants in Brazil entered the country illegally, making them especially vulnerable to becoming victims of forced labor. Large numbers of exploited workers are also employed in the construction industry and agricultural sector, as well as in households as domestic workers. In Haiti's case, many fall prey to a common practice called restavek, in which children from low-income families are sent to live and work in other households. In theory, the restavek system enables poor children to attend school and receive room and board in exchange for helping with chores like cooking, cleaning, and fetching water. In practice, however, the children are often exploited and in some cases verbally, physically, or sexually abused. According to the report, children in Haiti are also vulnerable to human trafficking into the Dominican Republic for domestic work, child labor, or forced prostitution. This is especially true for those who live in low-income areas controlled by criminal gangs, and children housed in the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps set up after Haiti's January 2010 earthquake. The Index noted that within Latin America, Brazil had developed some of the most relatively aggressive policies against slavery, including a national program that encourages businesses to boycott suppliers that engage in exploitative labor practices. Policies such as these could force businesses across the region to improve their labor practices. Still, without tougher legislation protecting the most vulnerable populations -- and stronger law enforcement efforts targeting criminal groups -- it's possible such programs will have a minimal impact in countries where hundreds of thousands live in slave-like conditions.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"How Gold Trade Fuels Modern-Day Slavery in Peru. Slave-like conditions, frequent accidents, disease and sexual exploitation are a normal part of the illegal gold mining trade in Peru, a gripping report by a watchdog group reveals. The report ( pdf ), by the US labor rights non-governmental organization Verite , chronicles the lives of kids like ""Gordo."" He was 12 when he was told he had to leave school and migrate to Peru's remote northern jungle region of Madre de Dios to work in the gold mines. Drug traffickers had forcibly displaced him and his family from their farm in the northern department of Iquitos. Gordo -- who like many others in this report spoke on condition their real names not be revealed -- worked six years in the mines in return for food and a mat to sleep on. A fellow teenager who demanded pay when he turned 18 was murdered and buried in an unmarked grave, he told investigators. ""Oscar,"" meanwhile, was 16 when his cousin persuaded him to come to work in the mines with promises of being paid ""in chunks of gold."" When he arrived after a five-day journey on the river, he found out his cousin had sold him to the mine, and he would have to work 90 days moving wheelbarrows filled with rocks and sand to pay off his cousin's fee before he could leave. Two weeks later, he fell sick with malaria and was left to die. Kept alive by other workers who gave him scraps of food, he ultimately worked a total of eight months in order to fulfill his ""contract"" and received ten grams of gold, which he sold for $115. He contracted yellow fever soon after escaping and was forced to go back to work in the jungle to pay back hospital fees borrowed from his mother. These stories are not uncommon in Madre de Dios and other illegal and informal mining regions of Peru, the world's fourth largest gold producer. Indeed, the NGO found that such exploitation is standard practice, an issue to a large extent ignored by the major international companies using it to make and sell jewelry worldwide. Conditions in Peru's informal and illegal mines were worse than anything Verite lead researcher Quinn Kepes had seen in places including Bangladesh and Liberia, he told InSight Crime. ""I can't think of any low-level unskilled worker in Madre de Dios I interviewed who is not suffering some kind of egregious labor rights violation,"" he said. Billion-Dollar Industry Fueled by Slavery Peru's human rights ombudsman estimated last year that informal and illegal mines directly employ 100,000 people and indirectly employ another 400,000. According to estimates by experts cited by Verite, such mines produce a 15 to 22 percent of all the country's gold, worth almost $3 billion annually. A 2012 newspaper investigation found that ""the majority of this illegally produced gold was exported by formal businesses that helped to launder it"" -- a process explored in InSight Crime's Breaking Down the Chain of Illegal Gold in Peru. A network of family clans and illegal criminal groups control much of the extraction of the gold via forced labor that some would say is akin to slavery. Poor Peruvians travel to mining regions with hopes of escaping poverty. Many of these are ""indocumentados,"" people who lack a National Identity Document (DNI), meaning they cannot work in any formal sector of employment in Peru. ""Extremely poor, geographically isolated, or indigenous Peruvians who never obtained a birth certificate and have thus been unable to acquire a DNI,"" fall into this category, noted Verite, ""individuals [who] are generally very vulnerable due to their lack of alternative employment and their low levels of education and socio-economic status."" Typically recruited in their local communities by middle men paid by the mine owners, the workers are tricked when it comes to pay and employment conditions, and ""told stories about miners striking it rich."" Having to work a 90-day contract unpaid, purportedly to pay off recruitment fees or travel expenses, is common. But workers often fall ill to tropical diseases, animal bites or mercury exposure; they get injured in workplace accidents, and time-off sick does not count towards the 90 days. They also accrue debts for food and lodging during that time, so the 90-day period only increases. Verite met workers who had worked nine months unpaid to complete the contract. ""Workers are unable to leave their employment before their contracts are up due to their extreme physical isolation and the lack of money to pay for transportation, () which constitutes physical confinement in the work location,"" Verite writes. Even when the 90 days are completed, workers are often forced to continue working unpaid or severely underpaid, the report continues. Workers reported being threatened with guns when they demanded payment, or believing that other workers had been offered as human sacrifices to persuade the gods to put more gold in the soil. The matriarchal head of a major Madre de Dios mining family , for example, is believed to have ""a devil's tail"" and is rumored to have ordered the killing of workers. ""Violence is rampant, but even if threats aren't real, the small police presence and faith in the supernatural means workers absolutely believe in the menace,"" said Kepes. Every Job Carries Risks Aside from the debt bondage enforced by violence or the threat of violence, laborers face perils in the work itself. There are a variety of jobs to be carried out within the mines, which operate outside of health and safety regulations often using old and unsafe equipment. Almost all of the labor is dangerous and physically exhausting. Accidents are common. ""Macheteros,"" or woodcutters, cut down the trees. Peruvian gold mining has seen tens of thousands of hectares of trees destroyed in an area of exceptional biodiversity, with deforestation tripling over the last five years. Macheteros face risks from long periods of exposure to the sun, falling trees, poisonous animal bites and burns, said Verite. ""Carreteros,"" or transporters, move wheelbarrows laden with rock and dirt, also facing risks of exposure as well as risks of long-term injuries associated with carrying heavy loads. The ""buzos,"" or divers, go into the mercury-contaminated rivers directing pumps that suck up silt containing gold particles. They run the risk of drowning in air bubbles, being buried underwater by collapsing mountains of sand or having their organs sucked out by the pumps. ""Maraqueros"" operate the pumps and use mercury to separate and condense the gold particles that they collect. These workers pick out the globules with their bare hands, often during 24-hour shifts. They face risks of severe sunburn, exhaustion and dehydration, aside from the skin and breathing difficulties, organ failure and brain damage associated with mercury exposure. Finally, there are the truck operators, who are typically untrained. They dig holes and pile up mountains of sand, while facing risks of falling rocks and the dangerous, unpredictable movements of these mountains of dirt. Verite received a large amount of reports of fatal accidents from miners it interviewed, and reports of workers being buried in unmarked graves without information being provided to their families or authorities. The housing visited by Verite in Madre de Dios was also shoddy, typically made out of plastic sheeting, without electricity and running water, meaning workers had to drink mercury-infested water. Medical attention for tropical diseases and injuries was usually non-existent. When it did, it was ""generally rudimentary and expensive,"" said the report. Workers told Verite most of them did not live past the age of 40, although a formal study of life expectancy in the area has not been done. A large network of peripheral workers serves the mines, including cooks, transporters, tire repairers and prostitutes, many of whom are minors, said Verite. Exploitation and dangerous conditions were also common in these sectors, especially in sex work. Thousands of women and girls are trafficked to mining communities each year, usually by family or informal networks. According to Asociacion Huarayo, an NGO in Madre de Dios consulted by Verite, almost all of the girls trafficked to Madre de Dios are deceived, kidnapped or forced into debt bondage, with the confiscation of identity documents and physical threats against them and family members a common practice. Women hired as cooks are also often forced to provide ""sexual favors."" In remote mining camps with no state presence and no access to communication, there is little chance of escape. Few Resources, Political Will Peru's government has pledged to formalize the illegal mining sector, though with corruption rampant among state and local officials, it faces immense challenges. There is a lack of resources and little political will to truly tackle the problem. Verite found the Labor Ministry to be the government department most committed to changing the status quo, but a lack of resources seriously impedes its work. Researchers were told by one expert that there was no certified labor inspector for the whole of Madre de Dios. Moreover, many mining regions are so remote and lawless, with mines guarded by heavily armed men, that ""authorities are not able to take any action or even step foot on these lands unless they are provided with military support,"" said Verite. The huge amounts of money at stake and the powerful interests involved in the industry mean prospects for real progress remain bleak unless the government summons up considerable resolve and financial resources. Various corporate social responsibility programs exist for companies refining and selling gold, but they are voluntary, while campaigns such as the NGO Earthworks' ""No Dirty Gold"" lobby retailers and consumers and demand changes in unethical mining practices. Though the outlook appears very bleak, Kepes said he remained hopeful. ""We have seen things change in a lot of industries,"" he said. ""Over the years if you get people together from different sectors, from business, from government, from NGOs then there is an opportunity for progress. Hopefully that political will, which does exist in the Ministry of Labor, will get the support it needs from companies and institutions, and the rest of government, to do the work they need to do to combat this issue."""	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
"Children, Sex and Gangs in Medellin. In the slums of Medellin, Colombia, adolescent girls have become the spoils of war and merchandise for criminal gangs; they are raped, abused, trafficked and even have their virginities auctioned off to the highest bidder. Medellin's hillside slums -- known locally as comunas -- are the fiefdoms of street gangs that not only control criminal activities, but also exert a tight grip on every facet of daily life. For local youth, contact with the gangs is unavoidable and many get drawn into their orbit. For girls in the comunas, recruitment begins with children as young as ten. According to one youth worker in the city's troubled Comuna 13 district, who did not want to be identified for fear of reprisals, once the process has begun it is near-impossible to stop. ""It is a chain,"" he said. ""They start with these girls, who get the benefits offered by these structures -- the drugs and the money -- and the girls become emissaries, bringing in other girls."" The girls' families, caught in a cycle of poverty and fear, have little option but to watch their daughters disappear. If they accept the gangs' advances they receive protection and financial help to ease the dire poverty in the comunas. If they reject them then they can either flee their homes or live in fear that every passing motorbike could be carrying an assassin, and every knock on the door could signal another name added to the list of Medellin's disappeared. Some of these children become concubines for the gang members, a situation now so common that it is accepted as a normal part of life in the comunas, according to Jesus Sanchez, the Medellin human rights ombudsman. ""In many cases the victims don't understand it as something bad, something that goes against morality, against ethics and human dignity,"" he said. ""There is this context where members of armed groups having sexual relations with girls of 10, 12, 13 years, who go with various members of the group, is not looked on as something bad."" However, for others, an even darker fate awaits, as they are passed through the criminal networks of which the gangs are only the street level operatives, and enter the shadowy world of the Medellin sex trade. For some, this journey begins with their virginities being placed on an auction block. ""[The gangs] seduce her by offering her consumer goods, gaining her trust little by little until they end up being photographed and auctioned off,"" said Luis Pardo, Director of NGO Centro Consultoria de Conflicto Urbano (C3), which has been investigating the phenomenon over the last year. Some are offered up to Colombia's top drug lords and paramilitary chiefs, who have kept up the tradition begun by Pablo Escobar of having teenage virgins delivered for themselves or for their narco-orgies. According to Pardo, the girls are passed from one capo to another until they are discarded, left with little option but to turn to prostitution. However, many of the girls are destined to be auctioned off to rich foreigners. The security improvements of the last decade have led to a surge in tourism as the city's reputation metamorphosed from a no-go zone of drug trafficking and extreme violence, to a thriving cosmopolitan city. The dark side of the influx of tourists has been a boom in sex tourism, with foreigners attracted by the city's reputation for beautiful women and Colombia's lax prostitution laws. In recent years, sex tourism networks have proliferated. Many are run by foreigners, mostly US citizens, who offer guided tours of the city's brothels and red light hotspots over the internet. Although prostitution is legal if the women are aged 18 or over, the tours are illegal as they are classified as acting as an ""intermediary."" According to C3's investigations, it is these networks' most trusted clients that participate in the auctions. Photographs of the girls are collected for brochures -- a small selection for hard copies, or online catalogues of up to 60 girls. Online customers are issued a secret PIN number to access the auction. C3 recorded bids of up to $2,600. ""It is a typical auction,"" said Pardo. ""The highest bidder is sold the girl's virginity -- it is a horror."" Following the auctions, the brochures are destroyed and the auction sites taken down, leaving almost no trace of what happened, according to C3. Most of the girls also disappear, lost to the Medellin underworld. Many will end up in the city center, where there are several zones notorious for child prostitution. The gangs that run the city center are known as the Convivir -- a name taken from community self-defense groups set up by former President Alvaro Uribe when he was governor of the department of Antioquia, which descended into paramilitarism and criminality. As with the gangs in the comunas, the Convivir tightly control both civilian and criminal life, including establishing authorized zones for activities such as drug dealing, street robberies and prostitution. However, while the Convivir regulate crime in the zone, it is specialist networks that actually manage the sex trade, according to city center residents. Some of these networks are little more than protection rackets taking a cut of profits, locals say. ""There are criminal bosses, and the children that go to work there have to give them part of what the client pays, if not then they rob them and run them off,"" said Edal Aldniel Yurient Monsalve Bran, a local resident and community leader. Others are more organized, trafficking girls, organizing auctions and maintaining properties or links with hotels where clients can go. ""They give [the girls] everything to maintain them, drugs, things for prostitution, clothes -- it is very organized -- and when the police come they pay them too,"" said one community leader and resident, who did not want to be indentified for security reasons. The Medellin police did not respond to InSight Crime's request for an interview. Many of the girls drawn into gang life and the Medellin sex trade simply disappear. In 2013, close to 600 children have disappeared -- a majority of them girls -- according to investigators in the mayor's office. The investigators say this number has been rising sharply in recent years, and although they cannot be sure, they think they know why. ""We believe that the girls that disappear are being recruited for human trafficking or the sexual exploitation of children,"" said Catalina Alvarez, an investigator with the Medellin Ombudsmen's office. The Medellin authorities say they are aware of the scale of the problem of sexual exploitation of children in the city, but their ability to tackle it is shackled by fear of the gangs and the silence this creates. ""We have contact with the community, and are trying to build trust so that victims come to us, but going from comuna to comuna looking for them is completely impossible,"" said Alvarez. However, those working to protect the girls are critical of their efforts. ""The response of the authorities has been minimal,"" said Clara Ines, Director of Medellin women's rights NGO Vamos Mujer. ""The girls that are used for this need to be able to report it, they need to be able to see the way they can save themselves, the way they can protect themselves -- because they kill them,"" she said. ""The girls are running a really high risk and that is why we are seeing more and more dead girls and women."" However, Ines believes that to truly tackle the issue Colombia and Medellin must also confront an uncomfortable truth about the roots of the problem -- the ""narcotization"" of the culture. ""In the narco-trafficking culture, girls are worth nothing,"" she said. ""They are disposable."""	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Police Break Up International Organ Trafficking Ring in Costa Rica. Police in Costa Rica have dismantled an organ trafficking ring that allegedly sold kidneys to patients in Israel and had connections in Eastern Europe -- two places that are at the nexus of the global illegal organ market. According to the authorities, donors were recruited in Costa Rica, and their kidneys removed either in the country, in Eastern Europe, where the ring is believed to have bases of operations, or in Israel, where the buyers were located. Police arrested Francisco Jose Mora, a leading doctor at San Jose's Calderon Guardia Hospital, who stands accused of coordinating the operation, reported Tico Times. They also arrested a police officer and former patient of Mora, who allegedly helped the doctor recruit potential donors. Police have identified three people who are believed to have been paid around $10,000 for their kidneys, and one woman who died on the flight back from Israel after allegedly selling her kidney through the organization. Costa Rica is a leading destination for medical tourism, which some experts say has contributed to the country earning the reputation as a global hub for ""transplant tourism"" -- which in turn is a semantic cover for organ trafficking. Most organ trafficking relies on recruiting the poor and desperate and offering them fees that seem astronomical to the donors but are dwarfed by the fees recipients pay to the traffickers. However, it is not uncommon for people to be forced into donating organs or for organs to be forcibly removed from victims of human trafficking. Eastern Europe and Israel are at the heart of this illicit trade, according to media investigations. Israel is one of the main destinations for trafficked organs, as it is a wealthy country but the health care system has chronic organ shortages, as many people are reluctant to register as donors for religious reasons. Thanks to mass immigration from the former Soviet countries, it has strong connections to Eastern Europe, where many of the main organized crime networks involved in the trade are believed to be based. According to World Health Organization estimates, around 10,000 illegal organ transplant operations take place every year, with kidneys accounting for an estimated 75 percent of cases."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Human Rights Group Highlights Mexicos Trafficking Centers. Mexico 's foremost human rights group has released a new report on human trafficking, naming close to half of the states and a handful of major cities as trouble spots for the criminal activity. As El Universal reports, the National Commission on Human Rights identified 15 of 31 states -- 32 if you include the federal entity of Mexico City -- as centers of human smuggling. The report defines ""human smuggling"" as the movement of victim who are trafficked against their will and under false pretenses, and does not refer to willing migrants who pursue migration through illegal channels. The report also names 11 cities as primary zones of operation for human traffickers. While many of them are concentrated in the northern of the country, close to the border with the U.S., many tourist destinations and cities in the geographic center of the country are also included on the list. In addition to border towns like Juarez and Tijuana, beach cities Cancun, Acapulco, and Puerto Vallarta all appear, alongside major urban centers like Guadalajara. What this demonstrates is that the problem goes well beyond simply vaulting people across the border -- it is a well developed and operationally sophisticated industry. The document also says that human trafficking is also closely linked to illegal immigration flows. Organized crime groups have taken on an increased role in both phenomena, as a recent report by the Washington Post indicated. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Soccer Corruption Hits Peru With Leading Arrest. The arrest of former president of the Peruvian Soccer Federation, Edwin Oviedo, showcases a new chapter in the profitable relationship between soccer and corruption in Latin America. On December 6, Oviedo was arrested for crimes he allegedly committed as a member of the "" White Collars of the Port "", based in Callao, including influence peddling and bribery, Led by former Supreme Court Judge Cesar Hinostroza, the White Collars were made up of business leaders, judges and other judicial officials, among others. Oviedo allegedly covered up illicit expenses by Hinostroza during the 2018 World Cup in Russia and gave him several tickets for matches by the Peruvian national team, according to a witness under protection. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Soccer Crime In exchange for these gifts, Oviedo was seemingly favored in a legal case against another criminal network he is suspected of belonging to, known as the Wachiturros of Tuman. He is accused of having led the group , which allegedly orchestrated the murder of two trade unionists at the Tuman sugar company, owned by Oviedo's conglomerate. ""There was a criminal organization within the sugar mill that silenced anyone who opposed the judicial administration chosen by Mr. Edwin Oviedo,"" said prosecutor Juan Carrasco , who is in charge of the Wachiturros case. Right now, Oviedo is in detention awaiting the next steps in the White Collars case, while Agustin Lozano has been named acting president of the FPF. However, Lozano is close to Oviedo and is also under investigation. When the FIFA graft scandal broke, it was the biggest corruption scandal in the history of soccer, leading to the downfall of 16 leaders of soccer governing bodies across in Central and South America and other high-ranking figures within FIFA. Many of those implicated in the case were accused of bribery and illicit enrichment. It was hoped that the scandal would be a wake-up call and usher in a new push for transparency in soccer associations, especially throughout Latin America. But that has not come to pass, as more cases continue to make headlines and tarnish the reputation of the most popular sport in the world. Crooked soccer executives throughout South America have a thorough understanding of how powerful the fanaticism the sport generates can be. They take full advantage of the sport's ability to distract while it entertains in order to amass their illicit profits. The love affair between soccer and organized crime has not only manifested itself in acts of corruption and fraud, but also drug trafficking and money laundering. In some cases, it has gotten to the point where supporter groups of particular teams have become comparable to all-out gangs, as with many of Argentina's barras bravas. As further cases are revealed, current soccer scandals may barely be the tip of the iceberg."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Coca-Cola Arson in Mexico Demonstrates Confidence of Criminals. The Familia Michoacana burned four Coca-Cola vehicles in the Pacific state of Guerrero after their bottling company refused to make extortion payments, according to reports, underscoring the power of criminal groups in the state. On August 4, hitmen from the criminal organization the Familia Michoacana intercepted and burned two Coca-Cola distribution trucks and two sales vehicles in the town of Arcelia, according to official reports seen by Proceso. The group allegedly forced the drivers of the vehicles to flee and then doused the trucks with gasoline and burned them with merchandise inside. Bottling company Femsa said in a statement that it had closed a distribution plant in Guerrero a week earlier after receiving threats, reported the Associated Press. Mexico has seen an explosion in extortion in recent years, affecting major corporations as well as small businesses. According to a report by Mexico's National Citizen Observatory, extortion increased more than eight-fold percent between 1997 and 2013, with 8,042 extortion cases reported last year. This rise in extortion can be attributed both to the diversification of criminal revenue streams as interdiction efforts have made drug trafficking riskier, and to the fragmentation of criminal groups, which has forced smaller factions to be self-sustaining, and turn to the local economy as a source of revenue. The fact that criminal groups are targeting major corporations like Coca-Cola is a troubling sign of their confidence. According to Proceso, there is a large military presence in the town where the Coca-Cola trucks were burned, which apparently did not deter the Familia Michoacana from burning the vehicles in broad daylight. In 2012, the Knights Templar targeted installations belonging to a subsidiary of PepsiCo in Michoacan and Guanajuato, which the authorities attributed to the company's failure to pay extortion fees. Other major companies -- including Carso and Cemex -- have also received threats, and according to the American Chamber of Commerce of Mexico over a third of foreign businesses surveyed in 2012 reported being threatened with extortion. Guerrero is currently the site of conflict between rival criminal groups, causing a spike in murders. The Familia Michoacana, the Knights Templar, the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG), and a splinter group of the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) known as Los Rojos are all reportedly locked in a fight for control of the state's criminal underworld.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Extortion of Mexico Inmates Families Underscores Corruption. Authorities are investigating complaints by family members of prisoners in Chihuahua, Mexico that they have been forced to pay extortion fees in order to get visitation rights, highlighting the rampant corruption in the country's prisons. Family members of prisoners at the State Social Rehabilitation Center 3 (Cereso Estatal 3) in Juarez have said they have to pay up to $150 per month for the right to visit their jailed relatives, and to prevent the prisoner from being subjected to punishments, including strenuous physical activity, beatings and solitary confinement, reported El Diario de Juarez. They also claimed that prison guards organize ""parties"" in which prisoners are forced to pay $37 to watch naked women dance, some of whom are female inmates (a plate of meat and two beers are included). If they cannot pay within two days, another $23 interest is added; further punishment comes to those who take longer. Jorge Chairez Daniel, the spokesman for the state's prison system, said he has not received any formal complaints but acknowledged the difficulty of monitoring the 500 guards working at the facility. The Juarez Attorney General's Office will begin investigations into the complaints, reported El Diario de Juarez. The case highlights the dire nature of Mexico's prisons, and the corruption that allows these poor conditions to flourish. The country's severely overcrowded prison system is rife with abuses, including the denial of the right to a fair trial , cases of torture and beatings, and the inability or desire to prevent violent uprisings. Prison guards were also accused of involvement in a major Zetas prison break in Nuevo Leon in 2012, one of many instances of corruption and collusion. While human rights violations are rampant, the Cereso case is interesting because it involves extortion by prison guards and the targeting of family members. Extortion is a word commonly associated with Latin American prisons in general, but it is usually the prisoners themselves involved in the act. Powerful inmates who effectively run prisons in Mexico, Venezuela and Honduras force their fellow prisoners to pay taxes in exchange for a range of services. Prisoners in the region also run extortion schemes outside of jails, using cell phones to exact fees with the help of accomplices on the exterior."	0	1	0	0	1	0	0
Bus Drivers Demand Protection in Guatemalas Most Violent Region. A total of 18 bus drivers have been murdered in one region of Guatemalan since 2012, indicative of the dangers that transport industry workers face across the region. A transport workers' association, ATRUCH, based in the capital of the eastern Chiquimula department, has asked police for better protection following the killing of 12 drivers last year and six more in the first four months of 2013, reported Prensa Libre. The ATRUCH president said that many of the homicides were related to extortion, adding that police have made no arrests in any of the cases. According to Prensa Libre, the governor of Chiquimula said that a police investigation found that the homicides were due to disputes between rival transportation companies, and had nothing to do with extortion. In a case illustrative of the kinds of pressures faced by transport workers, driver Mario Hernandez told the newspaper that he had received threats from alleged criminals demanding that he pay 50 quetzales (about $6.40) a day or be killed. Accounting for the other costs he was responsible for -- including buying gasoline -- he was only left with 60 quetzales (about $7.70) for his personal daily salary, Hernandez said. This was not enough to cover the extortion payment and provide for his family, so he quit his job, he added. As previously reported by InSight Crime , criminal groups have made driving a bus in Guatemala arguably one of the most dangerous professions in the world. Extortion is a major earner for the country's largest street gangs, the Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18, as well as the many smaller organizations, and public transportation is the most common target. Drivers on thousands of routes across the country are forced to pay an average of 400 quetzales (about $51) a week. Refusal to pay brings deadly consequences -- between 2007 and 2011, more than 500 drivers were killed in violent incidents. The problem is not limited to Guatemala - drivers in El Salvador, Honduras and Colombia face similar threats. However, it is unsurprising that Chiquimula should be struggling to keep its transport workers safe -- the department is the most violent in the country , registering a homicide rate of 89 per 100,000 inhabitants last year.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Departure of Honduras Security Minister a Victory for Corrupt Cops. With the departure of Honduran Security Minister Oscar Alvarez, an outspoken foe of police corruption, the country is facing an uphill battle as it grapples with attempts to reform its notorious police force. In a surprise move, the administration of Porfirio Lobo announced late Saturday night that it had accepted Alvarez's resignation. Up until now, he had been seen as one of the president's closest and most influential advisers. While officials are claiming that the resignation was voluntary, Alvarez was joined by Foreign Minister Mario Canahuati as well as several other ministers and deputy ministers, suggesting they were dismissed as part of a major shake-up. Indeed, on September 9, Lobo had announced that he would be making changes to his government, due to his ""concern"" about the country's deepening security crisis. The president said that he planned to involve himself ""directly in the subject of security with much more energy and force."" However, the politics behind the move suggest something different entirely. According to La Tribuna , an anonymous source claims that Alvarez's departure was the result of tension between his office and the leadership of the National Police. Allegedly, the top officials in the police force threatened to quit en masse if Alvarez was not forced out of office. This was likely sparked by Alvarez's repeated attempts to purge the police of corrupt elements, something which he has become known for in recent years. Indeed, in February 2010, Alvarez shared his doubts over the integrity of the police force in person with InSight Crime. According to him, the police are now more thoroughly infiltrated by criminal groups than at any point in history, as evidenced by the fact that there have been several cases of police working for local mafia groups. The tone of his rhetoric on police reform has become more and more confrontational. He made waves on August 17 by announcing that there was high-level corruption in the police, which he followed up by presenting a draft law to Congress to allow the immediate removal of police suspected of corruption. But perhaps his most outspoken indictment of the police force came on September 1, when he publicly called on National Police director Jose Luis Munoz Licona to fire 10 police officials who he claimed were acting as "" air traffic control men "" for drug flights. Such aggressive proclamations fueled tension between Alvarez and the police leadership, and doubtlessly contributed to his removal. Alvarez himself insinuated as much in the press conference following his resignation. ""I didn't have the economic support,"" Alvarez said. ""I was affecting big interests of drug trafficking, money laundering and kidnapping."" According to the Associated Press , when a reporter asked Alvarez if he was stepping down because of pressure from police against his anti-corruption drive, he responded: ""Those of you who are good investigative journalists should find out."" With Alvarez gone, the administration has lost its largest crusader against police corruption, an extremely pressing issue for Honduras. Bribery is a common feature of the country's police forces, and many Hondurans are accustomed to paying extralegal fees, known as ""mordidas,"" to resolve traffic fines and other issues. On top of this, police have been implicated in far more serious crimes, often with links to organized crime. Members of the police have been arrested for running kidnapping rings , robbing banks , and organizing extortion rackets which prey on local businesses. However, there appear to be other forces in play. Alvarez is very popular in Honduras, and is considered to be a potential presidential candidate for the 2013 elections. Within 24 hours of his resignation, the ex-minister had fled the country to the United States, because, he says, he fears for his life. While his departure from office seems clearly to have been sparked by his tensions with the National Police, it is not clear how much he is actually at risk, or what else may be behind the story.

"Political Kidnappings Persist Unchecked in Nicaragua. Political kidnappings carried out by pro-government paramilitary groups are going unreported by officials in Nicaragua, revealing another way President Daniel Ortega has masked insecurity and clamped down on his opposition. Since widespread protests erupted in April 2018, politically motivated kidnappings have skyrocketed, according to figures from civil society and human rights groups. Government statistics, meanwhile, ignore this trend, according to local news organization La Lupa. In past years, kidnappings in Nicaragua were relatively few and mostly carried out with the goal of extorting victims. The highest number of such kidnappings in the last five years came in 2017 with six cases. Five cases were recorded in 2013 and 2015, while 2016 saw just four, according to police data cited by La Lupa. But data collected by civil society and human rights groups over the past two years of unrest in Nicaragua shows kidnappings have spiked exponentially. In one four month period last year, a report from the Political Prisoners Committee found that 10 political kidnappings were taking place every day, according to local media reports. Victims are often arbitrarily thrown into clandestine jails or, in the worst cases, later found dead. Between April and September 2018 alone, the Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights (Asociacion Nicaraguense Pro-Derechos Humanos - AN PDH) recorded at least 512 deaths and 1,428 kidnappings. It's unclear exactly how many more kidnappings have occurred since the report was released. The advocacy group also noted the possible presence of clandestine graves. As InSight Crime warned in 2018, it appears that Nicaragua's paramilitary groups have evolved from ""political shock troops"" violently repressing the opposition to criminal syndicates carrying out coordinated kidnappings at the orders of political elites. And the government appears to be hiding the scale of their criminality. Nicaragua has long been considered much safer than its neighbors in Central America. Kidnappings were few and tended to be aimed at small-scale extortion. But today political kidnappings executed by groups of pro-government paramilitary forces armed with high-caliber weapons have become the norm, according to La Lupa's interview with Nicaragua national security expert Elvira Cuadra. ""Paramilitary groups are one of the most serious threats to security in Nicaragua, especially since they have been encouraged by the government and enjoy impunity,"" Cuadra told La Lupa. ""That affects all citizens and makes them potential victims of these groups, either for political reasons or for common crimes."" High-ranking members of the Nicaraguan military have denied the existence or presence of paramilitary groups, despite well-documented evidence of their role in everything from torture to forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Though the number of recorded homicides in Nicaragua has decreased , violence aimed at the opposition continues unabated. Dissenters still face arrest or assault from pro-government activists. The ongoing abuses carried out by paramilitary groups and the government itself suggests that the country's security situation is dire, even if a product of its own making."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"AMLOs Complex Pledge to Uncover Mass Graves in Mexico. Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador recently reinstated the National Search System for Missing Persons (NSSMP), raising hopes that a real effort to uncover clandestine mass graves will take place. However, his pledge raises more questions than answers about the rather complex implementation of this project. In late March, Lopez Obrador, also known as AMLO, stated that the federal government will allocate unlimited resources for the search of approximately 40,000 disappeared people. In addition, the program will also direct funds to assist the country's limited forensic system, which is currently struggling to identify over 26,000 bodies already in its morgues. The announcement by AMLO has been welcomed by multiple non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the United Nations. Activists agree that having an adequate allocation of resources would provide families and search groups the opportunity to explore the more than 1,300 clandestine graves already known to exist in the country, and to find many more. In an attempt to ensure that the NSSMP can succeed, each individual state is expected to create a search committee with the aid of the federal government, with Lopez Obrador demanding they be in place by September. The president added that, over the next three months, he would meet with relatives of victims, human rights defenders and experts to verify progress. Despite Lopez Obrador's commitment to tackle the challenging issue of forced disappearances and clandestine graves, the restoration of the NSSMP raises more questions about what is likely to be an uphill battle to implement this program. In the past decade, the arduous task to discover and explore clandestine graves has been mostly organized by the families of those who have disappeared and assisting NGOs. This is highlighted in the recent discoveries of dead bodies in mass graves in states such as Sinaloa , Oaxaca , Colima , Veracruz and Sonora among others. Of these, one of the most notorious is a mass grave uncovered in Colinas de Santa Fe, an urban area of Veracruz, where a group of families known as the Colectivo Solecito de Veracruz discovered over 300 human remains. A member of the group publicly denounced the lack of support and aid from the state's Attorney General's Office. The president's promise to provide unlimited resources to this mission does not provide clear answers to the multiple questions surrounding implementation. How will the federal government and Mexico's 31 states work alongside NGOs and families to ensure that resources are adequately being used? And given that these graves are often located in areas where organized crime groups operate, how will the government ensure the safety of those involved in the search efforts? On March 30, Abiram Hernandez Fernandez, a local activist who was actively assisting families seeking missing persons, was assassinated in Veracruz. Falko Ernst, a senior analyst for International Crisis Group, told InSight Crime that ""symbolically, this is a significant leap in the right direction when compared to the obstruction and denial of past administrations."" It is clear that Lopez Obrador sees this topic as a priority. The families of the thousands of victims are clinging to the hope that this is not another empty promise in a long list from the Mexican government. The ""[NSSMP] radius of action will only reach as far as the federal government is able and willing to provide protection,"" added Ernst."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Jefe Diego Free in Mexico, But Mystery Remains. Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, a former Senator, presidential candidate, and longtime political 'Jefe' of the National Action Party (PAN) was freed on Monday, but the mystery of who took him captive for over seven months remains. Cevallos spoke to reporters on Monday, with strong words for the government and in apparent good health. ""The authorities have some work to do,"" he said. He gave no indication of who his captors were but promised more information in the near future. Fernandez de Cevallos was reportedly taken by four armed men on May 14, when he arrived at his ranch house in the Queretero province. There was some blood on his car, the only indication of a struggle. But the government's efforts to track his captors failed, so the family publicly requested the PAN-government of Felipe Calderon to take a step back and negotiate themselves. It is not known if they paid a ransom, and little is known of the group that took him captive. A group calling itself the Network for Global Transformation took responsibility for the kidnapping, and sent various statements to the press during his captivity, criticizing Fernandez de Cevallos for being part of the ""hardline, fundamentalist right-wing."" Mexico's only rebel group, the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), denied it had any involvement in the kidnapping. Shortly, after his kidnapping, Calderon blamed ""organized crime.""

"Future of Police Cleanup Law Unclear As Honduras Faces Political Crisis. After Congress voted to remove several Supreme Court justices who rejected Honduras' police cleanup law, the future of President Porfirio Lobo's police reform efforts is now uncertain, as the country faces down an institutional and political crisis. Congress passed a bill late night on December 11 that would submit the police cleanup law, among other issues, to a popular vote. The next day, they voted 97-31 to remove four Supreme Court justices who'd blocked the police reform law two weeks ago, prompting an intense debate among congressional and legal officials who said the move was illegal. The proposed police cleanup law would require every officer to submit to polygraph and toxicological tests. It would also require them to take a psychological exam and hand over their financial records. In late November one branch of the Supreme Court ruled that the law was unconstitutional, arguing that it violated due process and did not give police officers a way to appeal their dismissal. Political tensions are currently running high in Honduras, with the Congressional vice president describing the process as ""a high-level political crisis"" even before the Supreme Court justices were fired. It's unlikely that the police reform referendum will be voted on before Honduras can solve the current conflict between Congress and the judiciary. If it does end up going to popular vote, this will likely spark another intense political debate, if the judiciary and other legal advisers argue that the referendum process itself is unconstitutional. Lobo's government committed to a mass purging of the police force after several officers were implicated in the murder of two university students in November 2011. At the time, the incident shocked the country and called attention to the deeply corrupt elements within the police force. Since then, Honduras committed to submitting hundreds of officers to polygraph tests. But progress has been slow: according to Honduras Culture and Politics , only a fraction of the 233 police officers who have failed the polygraph test have actually been dismissed. The Supreme Court has been scheduled to discuss the results of the tests in a meeting Wednesday, but were forced to cancel after Congress voted to remove four out of five of the Court justices."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Hugo Chavez: US Wants Makled to Vomit Accusations. InSight Crime translates an excerpt from Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's weekly column, ""Las Lineas de Chavez,"" in which Chavez speaks of Colombia's decision to extradite alleged Venezuelan drug trafficker Walid Makled to his home country instead of the US. Makeled is thought to have knowledge of corruption at the highest levels in Venezuela. ""On Tuesday November 16, (Colombian) President (Juan Manuel) Santos said that his government would extradite Walid Makled drug trafficker extradited to Venezuela. I quote verbatim his words: 'I gave my word (to President Chavez), and once the legal proceedings are over he will be extradited to Venezuela. I am a man of my word. 'This 'capo' has to responde to the Venezuelan justice for countless crimes. I believe that this announcement is of utmost importance and reaffirms the common policy, shared by President Santos and this president. Let's not get distracted: the political will that is necessary for the vigorous revival of relations between Colombia and Venezuela is on course, as is the growing trust between our two countries. The imperial rulers want Makled to be extradited to the United States. Washington wants to use him to vomit all sorts of accusations against the 'Bolivarian Revolution,' against the political and military leadership, so it can include Venezuela in the blacklist of countries supporting the drug trade. Do not forget that the mainstream media, nationally and internationally, has been positioning the image of Venezuela as a rogue state, following the imperial strategy and creating the conditions for a military intervention. What it comes down to is that they want to bring this president before the International Criminal Court. They will fail: they will not be able to repeat the tragic scene of Panama in 1989. Here there is a people and an Armed Forces that are ready to protect our sovereignty. I believe in the word of President Santos. And I have the assurance that the Government of Colombia is not going to partake in Washington's nauseating games that it devises in its dirty war laboratories."" Original Text: ""El martes 16 de noviembre el Presidente Santos anuncio que su Gobierno extraditara al narcotraficante Walid Makled a Venezuela. Quiero citar textualmente sus palabras: Yo le di mi palabra (al Presidente Chavez) y una vez se surtan los tramites juridicos se hara la extradicion a Venezuela. Yo soy un hombre de palabra. Este capo tiene que responder ante la justicia venezolana por sus innumerables delitos. Considero que este anuncio tiene la mayor importancia y reafirma la voluntad politica comun y compartida, por el Presidente Santos y por este servidor, de no dejarnos descarrilar: la voluntad politica que es necesaria para que el vigoroso proceso de relanzamiento de las relaciones entre Colombia y Venezuela prosiga su curso, fortaleciendo la confianza entre nuestros dos paises. El imperio pretende que Makled sea extraditado a Estados Unidos. Washington quiere usarlo para que vomite toda clase de acusaciones contra la Revolucion Bolivariana, contra su liderazgo politico y militar, y asi incluir a Venezuela en la lista negra de paises que apoyan al narcotrafico. No se olvide que la canalla mediatica, nacional e internacional, ha venido posicionando la imagen de Venezuela como un Estado delincuente, obedeciendo a la estrategia imperial de crear las condiciones para una intervencion militar. En ultimo termino, se trata de llevar a este servidor ante la Corte Penal Internacional. Fracasaran: no van a poder reeditar el tragico escenario de Panama en 1989. Aqui hay un pueblo y una Fuerza Armada con la mas firme disposicion de hacer respetar nuestra soberania. Creo en la palabra del Presidente Santos.

"Opposing Views on Security Battle it Out for Argentinas Presidency. With Argentina set to vote for its next president on October 27, the ongoing campaign has given hints of how the candidates would tackle the country's evolving criminal dynamics. The second of two debates brought together the six top candidates to present and discuss their proposals on six topics , including security and corruption. Although six people were on stage, all attention was on the two favorites, President Mauricio Macri, who secured almost 32 percent of the votes in the primaries, and Alberto Fernandez, a former government chief of staff, who secured about 48 percent, according to the official count. With the South American country embroiled in a devastating economic crisis, the candidates have not provided much detail about how they would tackle organized crime and rampant corruption. But a close look at the top two contenders' platforms and public statements show two very contrasting views. Mauricio Macri: Tough on Crime Mauricio Macri won the presidency in 2015 on a strong anti-crime and anti-corruption platform. Over the last four years, his government has been keen to showcase its achievements against organized crime and drug trafficking. While in office, Macri has invested resources in improving the way statistics on crime are gathered, increasing security operations and promoting key anti-corruption legislation. Under Security Minister Patricia Bullrich , Argentina widely increased drug seizures and arrests, expanded the role of federal security forces and developed a closer working relationship with international partners, including the United States. Macri's Juntos por el Cambio (Together for Change) coalition has made ""drug trafficking networks, the professionalization of the fight against complex crimes such as money laundering, terrorism and people trafficking"" the second point of their manifesto. Amongst the 14 specific proposals , one suggests tougher punishments for crimes including drug trafficking, a new approach to crimes committed by minors and tougher punishments for violent soccer fans, known as "" barras bravas ."" The platform, however, lacks specifics on how to tackle growing consumer markets that seem unabated by the rising seizures and arrests, reports of abuse and corruption at the hands of security forces and corruption accusations within their own ranks. During the debate, Macri used much of the time he was allocated to criticize the former administration of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (2007-2015) for what he said were failures to tackle drug trafficking organizations and facilitating elite corruption. ""We are different from them. We do not make deals with drug traffickers. We combat the mafias. We lowered homicides. We propose the creation of a modern penal code, one that increases penalties for drug traffickers,"" he said. Alberto Fernandez: Change of Course Differing from Macri in almost every economic, social and political issue, it is hardly surprising that Alberto Fernandez's Frente de Todos (Front of All) coalition is proposing broad changes to Argentina's security strategy. Most of the proposals in their platform seem to be structural - right up to the Security Ministry. Fernandez says that he would establish a Security Council and an independent Public Security Observatory to look at the various security issues affecting the country from a political, judicial and social standpoint. Details on both proposals, however, remained unclear during the debate and on paper. His platform is also proposing to modernize the federal police, providing work, health, and education for police and security force personnel, particularly women. And he is touting the creation of a Federal Program to Control Drug Trafficking (Programa Federal de Control del Narcotrafico) to ""establish a comprehensive strategy to control trafficking and commercialization of illegal drugs and related violence and criminal economies."" During the debate, the former government chief of staff said Macri's security strategy was punishing drug users and small-time traffickers without showing any lasting results. ""It's easier to talk about 'iron fist' policies and tougher sentences, but the fact is that insecurity is directly related to inequality. We propose to create a Security Council so security becomes a state policy, allowing everybody who needs to be involved to take part,"" he said. His vice-presidential running mate is former president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who stood trial for corruption charges earlier this year. Despite this, Fernandez sought to distance himself from ongoing accusations of the previous administrations he served in and pointed to ongoing investigations against Macri and some of his officials, as a tit-for-tat game dominated the debate. During the campaign, Fernandez also criticized the current administration for the way it handles the fight against organized crime and even pointed to the potential legalization of marijuana. ""We shouldn't persecute those who smoke marijuana. The solution is to act with some sense. I'm not referring to hard or artificial drugs, I'm talking specifically about marijuana,"" he told Pagina12."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Zeta Leader El Arabe Killed in Tabasco. The Mexican Attorney General's Office reported the death of of the head of operations for the drug trafficking organization known as the Zetas in the state of Tabasco, according to the Mexican daily El Milenio. Officials located the whereabouts of the Zetas member, Gabriel Garcia Carballo, alias ""El Arabe,"" after an extensive investigation, following his trail to a safehouse in a the mountain town of Puyacatengo. Upon seeing federal authorities, 'The Arab' and members of his security team opened fire and attempted to flee the scene in an armored vehicle, but were detained after a brief firefight. Although Garcia was killed in the shootout, officials captured three of his accomplices, including Didier Saul Hernandez Alvarez, alias ""El Gordo,"" the Tobasco cell's third in command. The death is a significant strike against the Zetas' operations in the state. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Bolivia Dismantles Fake Money Operation. Authorities in Bolivia have broken up a criminal operation dedicated to producing false local currency, in a case which highlights the spread of counterfeiting and the migration of criminal experts. Five individuals were arrested following a six month investigation in the city of El Alto by the country's Special Anti-Crime Force (FELCC) which found the enterprise in possession of sophisticated equipment and paper ""very similar"" to that used for Bolivian bank notes. The group were apparently producing 100, 50 and 20 boliviano notes -- worth approximately $14, $7 and $3 each -- and selling them in bulk for one boliviano ($0.14) each, reported La Razon. The group was allegedly led by a Peruvian, who remains at large, and sold the money to a woman who travelled monthly from the southeastern city of Santa Cruz to collect the notes. The investigation began after a complaint was lodged by the Central Bank of Bolivia, reported El Diario. Earlier this year, a counterfeiting operation producing US dollars and bolivianos was uncovered in the central city of Cochabamba. Colombia has traditionally been the region's major source of false currency and continues to be a key producer, with almost $6 million recovered in a single haul and two counterfeit euro operations uncovered last year However, that dynamic has begun to change and Peru has emerged as the region's primary producer of false dollars. According to a report last year , 17 percent of the counterfeit dollars in the United States originate in Peru. It is therefore no surprise that a Peruvian may be leading a Bolivian counterfeiting operation. Dollarization in Ecuador and Panama, as well as the black market in Venezuela , has driven the trade, with a case this year highlighting the flow of fake dollars between Peru and Ecuador. While Bolivia is not considered a major source of fake money, this case and the Cochabamba group demonstrate that it does play a part in the trade. The fact that the El Alto organization was selling to someone based in Santa Cruz, where transnational drug trafficking presence is on the rise , suggests that there might also be an organized crime element to this case."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Colombia Producing Its Own Drones. Colombia announced that it has begun building its own drones for military use, a sign of the changing dynamics of the country's conflict and the increasing use of this technology to counter organized crime throughout the region. On October 24, Janeth Giha, Colombia's vice minister of defence, told press that the government is in the process of building its own unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or ""drone,"" reported El Tiempo. The project has been in the works for the past year and a half. The UAV will be used for military operations as well as having civilian functions such as the monitoring of oil pipelines, according to El Pais. It is unclear whether it would also engage in combat operations. ""Several of our engineers have gone to countries such as Spain to train and are working on this project. The most important thing is creating a prototype that will serve our needs, not only militarily, but also for monitoring our energy infrastructure,"" Giha declared. Colombia is also planning to install a military radar in the central province of Meta by 2015. If approval is given for the project the radar will be developed with the help of South Korea. According to a US State Department cable released last year by WikiLeaks , Colombia began using US-supplied drones in 2006 to conduct counter-insurgency and anti-narcotics operations. Earlier this year, a Colombian Defense Ministry official told Israel and the US that the country urgently needed to acquire more drones thanks to a change in the dynamics of the internal conflict. Though the monitoring of energy infrastructure has been classed as a ""civilian"" purpose, it also involves elements of the conflict since the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) often carry out attacks on oil pipelines and energy stations throughout the country. The announcement that Colombia is already building its own UAV is representative of the country's ambition in becoming a key player in regional security. Colombia has helped train security forces in Guatemala, Mexico and Haiti , along with providing assistance in Honduras' efforts to clean up its police. In addition, the government run weapons manufacturer Indumil announced a 130 percent increase in arms exports for 2011. If Colombia is able to effectively develop its drone building capacity, it could potentially also rise to become an exporter of this increasingly utilized technology in the fight against organized crime. The US deployed drones in the Caribbean this year to monitor drug traffickers and has also sent them to Mexico to help in the fight against drug cartels. UAVs are also being distributed by Brazil, with the South American country having provided drones to neighboring Bolivia to gather information on coca plantations and drug trafficking routes."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Cauca Region Emerges as Potential Powder Keg in Colombia. Now identified as the principal national security threat, two of Colombia's most powerful emerging criminal bands (BACRIMs), are gearing up for a major confrontation over access to the country's Pacific coast. As the Cali-based Colombian newspaper El Pais reports , the government of the western Valle del Cauca department has become increasingly concerned by reports that the criminal group known as the Urabenos has arrived there. The Urabenos, also called the Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia, are one of the most powerful of Colombia's drug trafficking organizations, and are known for their high level of military discipline. Up until now they have been concetrated along the Caribbean Coast, but now seems to be strong enough to challenge their principal rivals, the Rastrojos , on their home turf. At an official assembly earlier this week, Senator Cesar Tulio Delgado joined other regional officials in confirming this development, saying that his office had received information indicating that both the Urabenos and the smaller Paisas are operating in the north of the department. The department's police commander, Colonel Julian Gonzalez, questioned these claims. He said he had no reports of either of these two groups in the region, contradicting sources in the government's secret police, the DAS, which InSight consulted. Colonel Gonzalez attributed new outbreaks of violence in the region to infighting amongst members of the department's main criminal organization, the Rastrojos. The Cauca region (consisting of both Valle del Cauca and neighboring Cauca departments) has long been a Rastrojos stronghold, ever since the group established itself there in 2002. Still, these accounts of increasing Urabenos activity coincide with the death of one Pedro Julio Lobo Gil, alias 'El Costeno,' who was shot to death on Wednesday in the municipality of Zarzal, which is also located in northern Valle del Cauca. According to a separate El Pais account , Lobo had previously been detained for links to the Urabenos, and although it has not been confirmed, some authorities regard his death as yet another indicator that the group is expanding its operations in the area. The potential arrival of the Urabenos to the Pacific coast is especially worrisome not only because of their historic rivalry with the Rastrojos, but because the Cauca region is also a major operating center for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ). As InSight has reported , the FARC and Rastrojos have repeatedly clashed there since February, despite the two groups' mutual alliance with the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN ). Cauca is also the scene of some of the most consistent and heavy fighting between the FARC and the army. For all actors involved, the Cauca region has major strategic importance. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , there were nearly 7,500 hectares of coca in Valle del Cauca and Cauca departments combined in 2009. Most importantly, the area is also home to hundreds of drug laboratories, where coca paste is processed into cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) and sent to the Pacific coast departure points to be moved in submarines, go-fast launches, fishing boats, or containers on large shipping vessels. From there, the product is shipped northward to Central America and Mexico. Ultimately, if reports of the Urabenos territorial ambitions in the area are correct, then the region could be a proverbial powder keg with the potential to ignite and spark a major shift in the country's drug war. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"A Closer Look at Brazil-Bound Drug Networks. Considering that Brazil is the second-biggest market for cocaine in the world, relatively little is known about the shadowy networks that connect it to drug producing nations in the region, especially compared to the drug cartels that have become almost household names in the United States. For that reason, Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper Extra's recent attempt to identify the biggest players in the (exclusively) South American drug trade is impressive. The investigation series, a result of six months' research and interviews with Brazilian, Peruvian, Bolivian and Paraguayan authorities, lays out the big names in what Extra refers to as ""Narcosul,"" a play on the name of the Mercosur trading bloc. Certain names on the list are well-known to regional security analysts, like Marcos Willians Herbas Camacho, alias ""Marcola,"" the imprisoned head of the Sao Paulo-based First Capital Command (PCC) prison gang. But the majority of kingpins identified by the paper have relatively low profiles, and appear to be known by few outside of law enforcement circles. The biggest of these is Luiz Carlos da Rocha, also known as ""Cabeca Branca,"" or ""White Head."" The 55-year-old Brazilian national is believed to be living in Paraguay, where he allegedly oversees a large-scale smuggling operation that moves Peruvian and Bolivian cocaine into Brazil across the porous Paraguayan border. According to Brazilian Federal Police, Cabeca Branca buys product mainly in Peru's Apurimac and Ene River Valley (VRAE) and Bolivia's Chapare regions. Other figures identified by Extra as the ""ambassadors of Narcosul"" operate in more isolated regions in the north, particularly in frontier regions in the border state of Amazonas. This includes Peruvian Jair Ardela Michue , who along with his brother Wilder built a major drug trafficking empire that linked a network of coca cultivators and laboratories in the Amazon Tri-border Region with distributors in the state capital of Manaus. From there, shipments were split either north to the Trans-Atlantic route or south to the consumer markets of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Wilder and Jair were arrested in 2010 and 2011, respectively, but their smuggling routes remain as popular as ever. Extra's investigation exposes these and other big fish of the Southern Cone, responsible for supplying cocaine, marijuana and other illicit substances to Brazil, and in some cases shipping them on to the more lucrative European market. According to the paper's estimates , South American trafficking networks pull in an astounding $9 billion from drug sales annually. To put this into perspective, the US State Department claims Mexican cartels earn between $19 billion and $29 billion from trafficking illicit substances. The $9 billion figure, which the paper bases off on ""the average price of cocaine produced in the region to be exported to Europe,"" is likely inflated, as it doesn't account for sales in Brazil. Still, shedding light on the underworld leaders who oversee the drug flow into the world's second-largest cocaine consumer (after the US) highlights some important trends. The first of these is the difficulty that Brazil has in policing its borders. Unlike the trafficking dynamic in the US, the overland flow of drugs isn't largely confined to one border. Instead, there are various countries with smuggling routes leading into Brazil -- a product of sharing borders with the world's three biggest cocaine producers: Bolivia, Colombia and Peru. In addition to the Paraguayan border and the Amazon networks, another popular method of entry is flying product in from Bolivia, and unloading it in the western states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. As Extra reports , one of the most notorious kingpins of this route is Lourival Maximo da Fonseca, alias ""Tiao,"" who is believed to be operating out of the eastern Bolivia department of Santa Cruz. Analysts agree that the lion's share of Brazil's cocaine comes from Peru and Bolivia, but there is considerable debate over the breakdown between the two. In 2011, just over half of all cocaine shipments seized in Brazil (54 percent) came from Bolivia, compared to 38 percent from Peru and 7.5 percent from Colombia. However, Bolivian authorities insist that the majority of this cocaine is actually produced in Peru, and the emergence of a so-called ""air bridge"" to Brazil via Bolivia supports this claim. Tracking these networks points to another trend in transnational drug trafficking in the southern hemisphere: the fact that all of them rely on corrupt officials and kickbacks to law enforcement to operate. This is part of the reason individuals like Tiao and Cabeca Branca are able to hide out so successfully in remote areas in the periphery of Bolivia and Paraguay. In the latter case, even though the kingpin has been operating in the eastern Paraguayan province of Amambay since the mid-1990s and owns large swaths of property there through third parties, the National Anti-Drugs Secretariat (SENAD) has never successfully detained him. Cabeca Branca's case provides some useful insight into how the kind of social circles traffickers run in facilitate their business. His organization has reportedly bought off key political and police officials at almost every level in Amambay. Before his arrest in September 2013 , one his lieutenants, Carlos Ruben Sanchez Garcete, alias ""Chicharo,"" was an alternate for a sitting congressman. What's more, that lawmaker's younger brother -- a police official with the Amambay police intelligence unit -- was arrested in March for tipping off Chicharo about police operations and investigations in the area. Other elements of Brazil's drug trafficking dynamic also suggest major differences between it and the illicit drug trade that winds up through Central America and Mexico to the US. For one thing, it appears to be more peaceable, or at least less viscerally violent, lacking in the massacres and gory killings that have defined turf wars between Mexican cartels in recent years. On the US-Mexico border, this is generally interpreted as a sign that a single group has established dominance over the local ""plaza."" Of course, there are major transnational crime syndicates in Brazil, like the PCC and Red Command (CV). And there is plenty of evidence that these groups have established drug trafficking networks stretching to Bolivia and Paraguay. But the existence of powerful independent distributors like Cabeca Branca and Tiao suggest that Brazil's most recognizable organized crime factions lack the kind of dominance over smuggling routes enjoyed by their Mexican peers. However, reports of growing PCC and CV activity in Brazil's neighboring countries suggest this dynamic may not be too far off."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Mexico State Oil Company Says Fuel Theft Reached All-Time High in 2017. Mexico's state oil company says it experienced record levels of fuel theft in 2017, but the underlying drivers of this issue are unlikely to be addressed in the near term, as officials this year will be distracted by an overall deepening of insecurity in the country as well as a general election scheduled for July. Statistics released on January 15 by Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), show the company recorded 9,509 incidents of fuel theft in 2017, shattering the previous year's record of 6,873 cases. The new data add to a years-long trend of increasing incidents of fuel theft in Mexico. According to the report, cases of fuel theft continued to occur in traditional regions, specifically those that contain large pipelines connected to main refineries. States that saw the most cases of illicit fuel syphoning in 2017 were Guanajuato with 1,696, Puebla with 1,343 and Tamaulipas with 1,033 cases. Furthermore, regions that traditionally experienced relatively low levels of violence, such as Guanajuato and Puebla, also witnessed upticks in homicides as criminal groups continued to battle for local and international drug markets, along with territory to conduct illegal fuel theft. The growing precariousness of the security situation in Mexico will likely hinder the implementation of innovative strategies to stop the seemingly inexorable rise in fuel theft observed in recent years. Moreover, the upcoming election will consume much of the attention of policymakers in the near term, further limiting their ability to take concrete steps toward addressing the drivers of this economically and environmentally harmful crime. To counter rising insecurity and violence, the Mexican government seems poised to continue its long-time approach of increased militarization. However, in addition to various human rights concerns, the strategy continues to prove itself ineffective in achieving long-term security gains. With regards to fuel theft, militarization has been unable to successfully combat the root issues of this growing illicit business, namely corruption and impunity. Soldiers are not trained to mount complex corruption investigations. And civilian police and judicial authorities have proven not to be up to the task, either. In the past, corruption networks have involved members at all levels of the Pemex hierarchy. In many cases, engineers charge a fee to criminal groups in exchange for information on how and where to effectively syphon off petroleum from pipelines that crisscross throughout the country. However, despite implementing tougher penalties for those involved in oil theft, like almost all crimes in Mexico, corruption at Pemex has gone largely unpunished due to structural weaknesses in the law enforcement and justice systems. New and creative proposals emanating from policymakers will likely be inhibited by elections. As politicians and political parties shift their focus towards winning regional and federal elections in July, the amount of attention they can devote to policymaking will decrease, limiting their ability to put forth any new policy proposals in the near future. 	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Why US Aid Cuts to Central America Will Help Organized Crime. In late March, President Donald Trump followed up on his threat to suspend US aid to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. He had repeatedly made this pledge, stating that these countries had accepted aid from Washington without any success in stopping migration and drug trafficking. The aid packages to these countries were substantial. In the 2017 fiscal year, Congress allocated $657.4 million to these countries, which was lowered to $615 million for 2018 and $527.6 million for 2019. In 2016 and 2017, around half of these funds went to supporting programs on public safety, justice systems, violence prevention, transparency and good governance, all related to fighting crime in the region, according to the Washington Office for Latin America (WOLA). Trump partially walked back this decision in May, stating that aid to police would be maintained. Two months on, a legislative source in Washington, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to reveal internal deliberations in Congress, told InSight Crime that US embassies in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have also been told not to commit any aid money that has not been spent from the 2017 and 2018 budgets. ""Washington is even reviewing contracts that have already been signed to determine if it is more expensive to break them than to continue them,"" said the source. ""The decision on 2018 funds is not to commit any money, so many believe that that has already been lost."" But a second legislative source confirmed that lawmakers from both parties who oppose the administration's measure are working on new language that would ""make it more difficult"" for the administration not to spend the money allocated for 2019 and projected for in 2020. Here are five ways in which the cuts will make things worse: 1. The Fight Against Corruption US money has served to strengthen specialized criminal investigation units in the three countries. In the cases of Honduras and El Salvador, the programs aimed at improving transparency in the judicial sectors were well funded in 2017, according to WOLA, with around $22 million in each nation. In El Salvador, US money awarded between 2015 and 2017 helped improve the capabilities of an anti-impunity task force in the Attorney General's Office and the Supreme Court, where criminal investigations prosecuted two former presidents for corruption and embezzlement. 2. The Prevention of Youth Violence A good percentage of the resources allocated in 2017 went to violence prevention programs: around $47 million dollars to El Salvador and about $33 million to Honduras. In El Salvador, this financial support was vital in launching the prevention element of El Salvador's 'Plan Seguro' in communities dominated by the MS13 and Barrio 18 gangs. SEE ALSO : Guatemala President Causes Constitutional Crisis to Oust CICIG 3. Combating Political and Criminal Mafias In Guatemala, US financial assistance was vital in showing support for the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG). But funding has decreased since 2017. The work of CICIG, along with the Attorney General's Office, has been essential for the Guatemalan justice system to prosecute organized political and criminal elements in the government. In El Salvador, the United States has contributed nearly $10 million to create a telephone intervention center controlled by the Attorney General's Office, which has been essential in investigating complex crimes involving political and business elites and drug trafficking groups. 4. The Empowerment of Criminal Gangs US President Donald Trump's administration has vacilatted between supporting anti-corruption efforts and the fight against organized crime and the backing for political regimes who are accused of facilitating corruption and drug trafficking, such as the administrations of Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales and Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez. The Honduran case is a strong example: Washington gave Hernandez a political lifeline when he faced strong doubts about the legality of his re-election, but US prosecutors have also pursued cases into members of Hernandez's inner circle and former president Porfirio Lobo. It is not clear how Washington will handle the increasing tension circling Hernandez as he remains one of its main allies in the region. 5. The Fight Against Drug Trafficking The case of Honduras best illustrates this. About 15 percent of the aid granted in 2017 by the United States to the region went to anti-drug activities , with Honduras receiving the most money in this category. Investigations by InSight Crime in major areas of narco-activity in Honduras, such as Olancho and Gracias a Dios on the border with Nicaragua, revealed that a Honduran army task force, advised and equipped in part by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), had reduced its operations in mountainous and coastal areas of northeastern Honduras. In recent months, activity at clandestine airstrips and drug shipments by boat have risen in these areas and in southern Honduras, which borders El Salvador."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"GameChangers 2017: Colombias Cocaine Explosion Stokes Political and Social Crises. Cocaine is one of the world's most in-demand drugs. Its production center is in the Andean region of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, where hundreds of tons of white powder are produced and shipped to consumer markets around the world every year. And it all starts with the bright green leaves of the coca plant. Now more than ever, this crop lies at the heart of international disputes between historic allies as well as domestic conflicts, tearing at the fabric of local communities. For the past several years, Colombia has reclaimed its title as the world's biggest cocaine producer, but it has also seen unprecedented expansion, according to the two most respected coca estimate reports. Indeed, while Bolivian and Peruvian coca levels have fallen slightly over the past decade, Colombia's coca explosion has singlehandedly put global cocaine production on an upward trajectory. (Graphic comparing coca cultivation in Andean countries) Colombia's cultivation of illegal crops grew by over 50 percent between 2015 and 2016, from 96,000 hectares to 146,000 hectares, the United Nations reported. According to US estimates , coca cultivation rose nearly 20 percent to 188,000 hectares. ""No government or non-governmental organization has estimated such high levels of coca production in Colombia since records began being kept on this issue,"" InSight Crime wrote in March. This historic surge is supported by evidence from InSight Crime's ongoing field research. Illegal groups continue to pressure farmers to grow the crop in some areas, while other farmers do so due to lack of opportunities, as well as the hope that they may eventually receive government benefits as a result. From the information gathered, we believe that actual coca levels far exceed official estimates in many areas. (Map taken from a regional analysis of coca crops in Colombia) Cocaine producers have also found ever more innovative ways to process the drug, raising the drug yield per hectare. Today, InSight Crime believes that Colombia alone is churning out around 1,200 metric tons of white powder a year. With such huge amounts leaving the country, pressure is mounting for the Colombian government to stem the drug boom. And they have made some questionable decisions in order to achieve this. A November 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) included a promise that the government would prioritize substitution programs for farmers to voluntarily uproot their coca for legal alternatives. But the process has not been so straight forward. Instead of focus efforts on this softer approach, Colombia's government opted for a double-pronged policy for 2017: negotiating with farmers while simultaneously boosting forced eradication operations. ""There is little evidence that destroying coca fields will lead to a long-lasting reduction in cocaine levels"" ""The Colombian government will aim to eradicate 100,000 hectares of the cocaine-producing plant this year despite only uprooting 17,593 hectares in 2016,"" we wrote in January. ""Eradication efforts will be split evenly between the voluntary substitution of coca crops for legal alternatives, and forced eradication by state forces."" Predictably, this has led to intense protests by local coca farmers and holdouts against eradicators, with bloody consequences. This finally erupted in October when security forces allegedly massacred several protesting farmers in the world's biggest coca hub: the municipality of Tumaco in the western department of Narino. ""The casualties in Tumaco are the most numerous yet seen in such an incident, and could suggest that the Colombian government -- under heavy pressure from the United States -- may be turning to more heavy-handed measures as it strives to achieve its [eradication] goal."" Indeed, internal politics are far from Colombia's only problems. The United States, after having funneled billions of dollars into the drug war in the country over the past two decades, is expecting far better results. ""The forced eradication figures from this year may have been inflated to make the efforts seem more successful than they actually were"" Rather than honing in on prevention efforts at home, US officials have harshly reprimanded Colombia, threatening to blacklist the country for its ""failed"" anti-drug approach. In August, the top US diplomat for counternarcotics William Brownfield went so far as to caution that ""'bilateral political problems' could result from differences of opinion between the United States and Colombia about how to deal with rising cocaine production."" One crucial ""difference"" is that of aerial fumigation of drug crops, a practice Colombia banned in 2015 due to health concerns. ""The United States has been pushing for fumigation to resume since even before Trump entered office, but US officials have failed to address the longstanding argument that aerial spraying has been an ineffective strategy for controlling coca cultivation in Colombia,"" we reported following controversial and confusing statements by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on the topic. With Donald Trump in the White House and threatening to cut aid to Colombia (and the rest of the world ), Colombia is trying to balance smart policy-making on one hand, while maintaining relations with the United States as one of its primary ""post-conflict"" funders on the other. Amid all this controversy, a key question remains: Will Colombia's eradication gamble pay off? President Juan Manuel Santos announced in December that authorities had surpassed their ambitious goal to forcefully uproot 50,000 hectares of coca in 2017. And he set a new goal for 2018: 65,000 hectares. However, InSight Crime field research has revealed not only that Colombia has far more coca than is being reported, but that according to Colombian military sources, ""the forced eradication figures from this year may have been inflated to make the efforts seem more successful than they actually were."" More importantly, there is little evidence that destroying coca fields will lead to a long-lasting reduction in cocaine levels. Many if not most farmers recultivate crops after they have been destroyed, and if no alternative income is available, they have little choice. (Graphic showing coca cultivation versus eradication in Colombia) ""The root causes of continued coca cultivation -- including poverty, state abandonment and criminal dynamics -- are likely more powerful in determining levels of coca cultivation,"" we wrote in June. Colombia remains between a rock and a hard place as it enters 2018. While the country has reinvested in its carrot-and-stick policy for another year, it is still waiting for ""carrot"" substitution programs to kick in, setting the scene for more friction. Even so, it is unlikely that the United States will be satisfied with Colombia's efforts. The Andean nation may well have to choose between hedging its bets with the effective long-term strategies, and some form of political fallout. But 2018 is a presidential election year in Colombia, which may turn the tables should the opposition come into power. The election of a new political force could undermine peace process promises and replace them with strong-armed anti-drug policies more palatable to the United States.

Why Colombia is Reluctant to Stop Fumigating Drug Crops. Colombia's president reportedly plans to suspend the use of glyphosate in aerial fumigations, a controversial practice that politicians and security officials have consistently used to measure success in the drug war, and perhaps explains why some remain so reluctant to stop spraying. Following a meeting with President Juan Manuel Santos, Conservative Party leader David Barguil said the president would soon issue the order, following recent recommendations by the Ministry of Health and World Health Organization , reported El Colombiano. The issue will be discussed further on May 15, when Colombia's National Drug Council will analyze the health risks of gylphosate -- recently labeled a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Colombia's Drug Council will also look at the possible impact that this suspension may have on drug production. Since 2001, gylphosate -- the active ingredient in the household herbicide Roundup -- has reportedly been used to fumigate more than 1.5 million hectares of illicit crops in Colombia. Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon has said aerial fumigation is an important tool for the military to combat cocaine production, and that security forces would continue to fumigate until Santos ordered them to stop. Colombia's aerial fumigation policy has been extremely controversial since it began in 1994. The recent findings by the IARC added new fuel to arguments used by longtime detractors of the policy. Rural communities affected by aerial spraying have complained that fumigation of coca plants also results in the destruction of legitimate food crops, and that the chemicals used have led to health issues and birth defects. Nonetheless, aerial fumigation has remained the preferred method for Colombian (and US) government officials when attacking drug cultivation at their source. This is partly due to the dangers involved with manual eradication -- with groups such as the FARC planting landmines in coca fields and attacking eradicators -- as well as it being a labor-intensive task. There are, however, other considerations at play for politicians when considering the ongoing use of aerial fumigation. One is money. As reported by the Washington Office on Latin America, the US State Department has spent between $1 billion to $2 billion on herbicides, pilots, escort helicopters, and other costs related to Colombia's fumigation program since 1994. Another is that aerial fumigation allows politicians to demonstrate they are taking action and making progress in fighting drugs; with the number of acres fumigated providing convenient, ready-made deliverables for constituents. Indeed, over the years, the number of coca crops under cultivation has become an important proxy for measuring success in the broader war on drugs.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"PDVSA Officials Plead Guilty in $1 Billion Bribery Scheme. Three officials at Venezuela's state-run oil company pled guilty in the US for their roles in a kickback scheme reportedly worth an estimated $1 billion, underscoring the scope of corruption in the country and the failures of authorities to confront it. Court documents unsealed March 22 detail a scheme in which two businessmen paid three former Petroleum of Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) officials to ensure that their companies ""were placed on PDVSA bidding panels, which enabled the companies to win lucrative energy contracts,"" according to a US Department of Justice (DOJ) press release. The New York Times reported the scheme was worth $1 billion. The documents were made public after Florida resident Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas pled guilty to three charges, including violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The three former PDVSA officials, Jose Luis Ramos Castillo, Christian Javier Maldonado Barillas and Alfonzo Eliezer Gravina Munoz, all pled guilty in December 2015 to conspiracy to commit money laundering. In their pleas, the PDVSA officials testified that Shiera Bastidas and his counterpart Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez, of Texas, gave them bribes and other favors. The documents show that Shiera and Rincon also helped the PDVSA officials launder the money. At least one of the officials had money deposited into a bank account in Panama. According to the Department of Justice, the charges against Rincon Fernandez are still pending. The Swiss government has also agreed to assist the US government in its investigation. In a statement, Switzerland's Federal Office of Justice said it would provide information to US authorities from at least 18 banks that have done business with PDVSA, Reuters reported. The kickback and bribery scheme sheds further light on corruption within PDVSA. Last March, US Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) accused PDVSA officials of laundering $2 billion through the Andorran bank Banca Privada d'Andorra (BPA). An opposition politician recently said corruption at the state-run oil company has cost the Venezuelan people $10 billion. Despite the suspected widespread corruption at PDVSA, few officials have been charged or investigated by Venezuelan authorities. Venezuela's inaction contrasts sharply with the vigorous investigations into corruption at Brazil's state-run oil giant Petrobras. The investigations, known as ""Operation Car Wash,"" have implicated numerous political elites and Petrobras officials, including billionaire businessman Marcelo Odebrecht , who was sentenced earlier this month to 19 years in prison. Former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was recently detained , and current president Dilma Rousseff is facing increasing pressure to resign over her alleged links to the scandal. Although the scandal has ignited social unrest in Brazil, it is arguably a sign of the independence and strength of the country's judicial system -- something that is lacking in Venezuela."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Gap Left by Fallen Guatemala Drug Lords Filled by Competing Clans. Authorities in Guatemala say the underworld has fragmented in the wake of the arrests and extraditions of the country's top drug traffickers, but the flow of cocaine has been unaffected. So far this year, Guatemala has extradited two of the country's most powerful drug traffickers, Juan Ortiz Lopez , alias ""Juan Chamale,"" and Waldemar Lorenzana, alias the ""Patriarch."" The pair will join Mario Ponce Rodriguez, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison in the United States in 2012. The vacuum left by senior traffickers is being filled by their family members, friends and their security chiefs, according to anonymous antinarcotics investigators that spoke to Prensa Libre. Ortiz's organization has fractured into two groups, both trafficking drugs on the Pacific Coast, the officials said. One is headed by family members of Ortiz, while the other was under the control of a former associate, Felix Pimentel Lopez, until his arrest late last year , and is now in the hands of one of Pimentel's lieutenants. The trafficking routes controlled by Lorenzana, which run through the east and the north of the country, also remain in the hands of his family and allies, among them Lorenzana's son Haroldo, according to the investigators. Also operating in eastern Guatemala, and in parts of Peten in the north, is what remains of Ponce's network. Investigators are on the trail of Ponce's brother Jorge. The family members that have taken over the networks are being challenged by the fallen drug lords' former security chiefs, who have looked to take advantage of the weakening of the organizations, say officials. These hitmen and bodyguards have used their knowledge of the groups' routes and structures to form cells of ""tumbadores"" -- drug thieves -- not only to sell on the shipments, but also as part of a strategy to seize control of trafficking corridors. Despite this turbulence, officials noted they had not seen any appreciable decrease in the quantity of drugs passing through the country. The Guatemalan underworld has been in a chaotic state of flux in recent years, as InSight Crime reported last year. As noted by the Guatemalan authorities, the families and allies of fallen capos have taken over operations, but their grip on power is often more tenuous, paving the way for new organizations to emerge. The situation has been further complicated by the collapse of Mexico's Zetas, who had seized control of much of the country's drug trafficking routes in a violent offensive after first arriving in the country in 2007. However, none of this has done much to affect the flow of cocaine. The supply from South America remains steady, and Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel is a ready buyer of product from Guatemala's transport organizations."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"RawFeed: Examining the Human Toll of Venezuelas Soaring Crime Rate. As both Venezuela's government and the opposition battle over the significance of the country's rising murder rate, neither side seems to be focusing on the street-level factors of the violence. A report from the British daily the Guardian, however, sheds light on the gritty underworld of Venezuela's street gangs. Violence and insecurity have plagued Venezuela for years, so much so that the government stopped publishing crime statistics in 2005 in an effort to stem criticism from the opposition. Despite the lack of official data, some civil society organizations in the country have presented their own alarming statistics about homicides. Last August, the independent Venezuelan Observatory of Violence (OVV) alleged that the number of murders in the country had nearly quadrupled during the course of President Hugo Chavez's eleven years in power, going from 4,550 in 1999 to 16,047 in 2009. In early February, however, as reported by Spanish news agency EFE , the government announced that the murder rate for 2010 was 48 homicides for every 100,000 people. While lower than the Observatory's estimate of 57 per 100,000, the rate is still higher than that of both Mexico and Colombia, making Venezuela one of the most violent countries in Latin America and the world. On top of the rise in homicides, Venezuela has now far overtaken Colombia, once known as the ""kidnapping capital of the world,"" in the total number of reported kidnappings. According to a special report by Venezuela's El Nacional , kidnapping has increased by 430 percent since 1999. Despite the gravity of this development, Venezuela's crime rate has turned into something of a political football , with both the government and the various opposition movements attempting to frame it according to their interests. As such, critical analyses of the criminal actors involved in Venezuela are difficult to come by. That's why the Guardian's recent report on 'malandros' (street gangsters) in Caracas stands out as an example of in-depth investigation into the dynamics of street crime in the country. In it, Guardian reporter Rory Carroll details an ongoing conflict between rival gangs in El Consejo, a shantytown of 50,000 on the edge of Caracas. The battle was apparently sparked by a case of teenage bullying, and has waged for eight months. Seven youths have died in the fighting, and the violence has resisted even the strongest of local gang rehabilitation programs. Although both sides appear to recognize the futility of the conflict, it is fueled by a lack of economic opportunity combined with a strong sense of neighborhood identity. Even for those who attend school, well-paying jobs are scarce, which provides little incentive to those weighing a gangster lifestyle against a life free of crime. As Carroll notes, this situation results in two paths: ""one filled with danger, good money, prestige and the chance to 'defend' the community. The other filled with long hours, a minimum wage and a lesser but still real chance of getting killed just because some kid flicked a possible piece of popcorn. Which would you choose?""

Sinaloa Cartel Suspected of Killings on Colombias Pacific: Police. Police in Colombia are investigating whether Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel is behind four recent murders in the port city of Buenaventura, amid growing concern over the cartel's presence in Colombia, with reports that the group met with gangs in Medellin. The police commander in Buenaventura, Colonel Jose Miguel Correa, said the authorities are investigating the possibility that the Sinaloa Cartel carried out four recent murders in retaliation for a recent cocaine seizure, reported El Tiempo. The seizure -- which took place in August -- saw anti-narcotics police confiscate 1.3 tons of cocaine, thought to belong to the Sinaloa Cartel, that had been hidden in a shipping container bound for Guatemala, reported EFE. According to El Tiempo, police believe the Sinaloa Cartel may be making a bid to take over drug shipments in Buenaventura now that one of the city's main drug trafficking groups, the Bustamente clan, has been decimated by a series of recent captures. Correa stated that police were trying to determine whether the Sinaloa Cartel plans to completely take over drug shipments in the city or form alliances with local groups. The director of Colombia's anti-narcotics police, General Ricardo Alberto Restrepo Londono, told EFE that the cartel had established a presence in Colombia's Pacific region in order to directly negotiate cocaine shipments and cut out intermediaries, so they could increase their profits. Police investigations into the Sinaloa Cartel's role in recent Buenaventura murders come amid reports of the cartel's activity in other regions of the country. Earlier this week, El Tiempo published an investigation on a suspected meeting between Sinaloa Cartel emissaries and local Medellin gangs that sparked a debate among officials about the nature and extent of the group's presence in Colombia. Medellin officials said there was no evidence to suggest the meeting took place, but the police and the city's ombudsman told the newspaper that the meeting had taken place. Like Medellin, Buenaventura is a key location to control for the Sinaloa Cartel. The port city is important as a drug shipment point , and for its proximity to coca-growing regions. The Sinaloa Cartel used to work with the Rastrojos in Colombia's Pacific region before the group's decline, and is likely in the market for a new ally.	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Ecuador Jails Swell with Pretrial Detentions, Cocaine Trafficking. The prison population in Ecuador has risen dramatically in the past four years, a phenomenon tied to the overuse of preventive detention, but also likely linked to the country's ever-growing importance as a drug transit nation. In October 2007, the country registered 19,500 prisoners, which the country's prosecutor general called a ""record number,"" according to El Comercio. The Organization of American States (OAS) reported a 2007 total of 18,675 prisoners, By 2009, the total number of prisoners in Ecuador had dropped to 10,881, according to OAS figures. Since then, the prison population has shot up again, reaching 24,203 prisoners as of October 2013, reported El Comercio. Just taking El Comercio's numbers, this represents a 122 percent increase on the population of four years ago, and is 96 percent higher than the current official capacity of the system, 12,338. (See El Comercio's graphic below) Professor Jaime Vintimilla of the San Francisco University in Quito said the growing prison population was related to the excessive use of preventive detention measures for suspects who had not yet been convicted. As of December 2012, 37 percent of Ecuador's prisoners were pre-trial detainees, according to figures from the International Centre for Prison Studies. The overpopulation of prisons is a regional phenomenon in Latin America , and has led to major human rights concerns and a lack of control over the prison systems in countries including Mexico, Venezuela and El Salvador. This is often connected to excessive and lengthy pre-trial detention periods, failings in the justice system and overly harsh penalties for minor crimes. However, in Ecuador the growing prison population is likely influenced by another factor: its status as a major transit nation for illicit drugs. Despite the dip in 2009, the overall growth in the number of prisoners has coincided with increased cocaine seizures in recent years, which rose from 14.8 tons in 2010, according to the US State Department , to 53 tons this year (through November 2013). The country has also become a veritable United Nations of crime. The most recent police operations in various of the country's ports in the last few days resulted in a haul of over 900 kilos of cocaine and the arrest of 10 suspects, including Colombians, Cubans and a Chinese national, reported AFP. While pre-trial detention is clearly an important factor affecting Ecuador's prison system, the presence of transnational criminal groups and the country's use as a drug transit point is also a likely contributor to the rising prison population."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Bolivia Weighs Up Coca Tax. Bolivia's government is considering placing a tax on coca crops, reports newspaper La Razon. Vice Minister for Coca and Integral Development German Loza Navia said that the government is studying various proposals for how to implement a tax. Coca is mainly found in two regions: Chapare in Cochabamba and Yungas in La Paz, and only to a total of 22,000 hectares (a little over 54,000 acres). At the moment the government charges a symbolic tax of 30 bolivianos (some $4.3 dollars) on farmers, and there are tight restrictions on the transport of the leaf. Bolivia has faced criticism that its permissive attitude to coca has encouraged more cultivation of the crop for the purpose of making cocaine. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Argentina Asset Seizure Decree Debuts with Mixed Reviews. For the first time, authorities in Argentina are using a criminal asset seizure program -- a legal mechanism that strips criminal groups of their wealth but comes with potential pitfalls. On July 16, Argentina's Attorney General's Office requested the forfeiture of nearly $19 million in assets from members of the Loza clan, a large criminal organization with international connections. This was the first large-scale use of a decree signed by President Mauricio Macri that created the Asset Seizure Regime (Regimen de Extincion de Dominio), after a similar bill had failed to pass through Congress for two years. The asset forfeiture program allows authorities to investigate the origins of assets owned by suspected criminals in a process that runs parallel to a criminal investigation. If the owner of the assets cannot justify how they were paid for, they can be seized even before a conviction is secured. Under the decree, cases involving crimes such as drug trafficking, corruption, organized crime, terrorism and people trafficking would be liable to asset seizure. Authorities can look at crimes that go back as far as 20 years. The Loza clan's assets were seized after 12 members of the group were arrested last December and charged with crimes that included drug trafficking and money laundering in Argentina. Others members of the organization are under investigation in Spain and Italy. The clan ran a sophisticated cocaine trafficking ring involving drug producers in Peru and Bolivia, corrupt customs officials in Argentina, and a drug distribution network in Spain and other European countries. Authorities said the organization was particularly efficient at laundering millions of dollars in illegal earnings through the purchase of hundreds of luxury properties and vehicles in a number of countries. In principle, asset forfeiture hurts crime groups the most where they can least afford it: their wallets. Asset forfeiture has helped in the dismantling of mafias and drug organizations, allowing authorities to confiscate cash or property obtained through illicit means. But critics say asset forfeiture laws are often too broad and poorly implemented. Even though these policies are relatively new in Latin America, at least a dozen countries have similar laws in place and others are either considering or in the process of implementing them. Argentine prosecutors have said that the asset forfeiture decree is essential, as it can help shorten often lengthy criminal processes. Critics, however, say it creates a parallel investigation, where the accused is forced to prove they are innocent, which runs counter to Argentina's constitution. Establishing ownership of assets is also difficult, which could lead to the forfeiture of money or property without criminal ties. In addition, asset seizures in Argentina could be used for political retribution, as many high-level politicians are facing corruption charges and the country's judiciary is confronting much criticism. Authorities assure this will not happen, but a strong, independent oversight mechanism is needed to provide as much transparency as possible to the process. This type of mechanism, however, is not being considered. Asset forfeiture laws have also been abused. In the United States, civil forfeiture laws allowed cash-strapped police departments to add seized assets to their budgets. This provided an incentive for police to confiscate money, cars and homes from people who were later convicted of only minor crimes. Latin American countries have also struggled with government red tape and a lack of consensus when it comes to the use of funds from asset seizures. In Mexico, for example, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has proposed creating a new government body to allocate seized funds to education, sports and other social programs. But questions remain as to whether this plan is realistic. In Argentina, officials have placed an emphasis on the amount of cash and property to be seized, as opposed to what exactly authorities will do with the money.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Arrest of Paramilitary Warlord Opens Way for Urabenos. The arrest of a former paramilitary leader who wielded significant power along the Caribbean coast could open the way for criminal organization the Urabenos to further consolidate their rule in the region. Police in Bogota reported arresting Ruben Giraldo , a demobilized member of Colombia's now-defunct paramilitary umbrella organization, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). He is charged with homicide, forcing internal displacement, and conspiring to commit a crime. Giraldo led a criminal organization active in the Caribbean departments of La Guajira and Magdalena, made up mostly of other former paramilitaries who once fought alongside him in the AUC faction the Tayrona Resistance Front. His criminal group, known as the Giraldos, or else as the Oficina del Caribe, has been accused of running cocaine trafficking operations in the coastal region. The Giraldos are also known for their aggressive war against rival criminal organization the Urabenos , which is also made up primarily of former paramilitaries. The Giraldos-Urabenos war caused homicides to spike in Magdalena department, and helped make tourist hub Santa Marta one of Colombia's most violent cities. The 42-year-old Ruben Giraldo lived in an apartment in one of Santa Marta's most well-known beachside resort areas, and played an important role in directing the Giraldos' campaign against the Urabenos, according to media reports. He was arrested in November last year for illegally carrying a weapon, but was released. He has been accused of being involved in more than 150 deaths in Magdalena department, when he was active in the AUC. As a nephew of extradited paramilitary warlord Hernan Giraldo, alias ""El Patron,"" Ruben Giraldo was a prominent figure in the criminal world. His story is indicative of many of the shortcomings of Colombia's Justice and Peace process, which aimed to prompt paramilitaries to demobilize and testify about crimes, in exchange for reduced punishment. While Ruben Giraldo officially demobilized with the Tayrona Resistance Front in 2006, he took up arms again and refused to testify about the AUC's participation in massacres and displacements. Colombian justice has only belatedly recognized Giraldo's failure to cooperate: last December, the attorney general requested that he be expelled from the Justice and Peace process, alongside 354 other paramilitaries. Giraldo's arrest will likely ease a great deal of the pressure that the Urabenos were facing on their home turf. As previously noted by InSight Crime , the Giraldos were the only criminal organization that were challenging the Urabenos in the Caribbean. Elsewhere, the Urabenos are battling the Rastrojos for a foothold in southwest Colombia and factions of the Oficina de Envigado for Colombia's second-largest city, Medellin. If Ruben Giraldo's arrest leads to the weakening of the Giraldos, this will grant the Urabenos more breathing space in a territory where, arguably, they cannot afford another bloody, drawn-out conflict. The Giraldos faced significant obstacles in battling the much larger and wealthier Urabenos. They were able to gain a slight advantage after Urabeno top commander Melquisedec Henao Ciro, alias ""Belisario,"" was arrested by police last October. It is worth questioning whether authorities gained the intelligence needed to capture Ruben Giraldo from Belisario himself, who would likely have an interest in facilitating the arrest. Notably, the Urabenos are also known for their corrupt links to some elements of Colombia's police force: three officers based in the Caribbean coast were arrested in February , accused of collaborating with the criminal group. There are other signs that the Giraldos may not have much of a future ahead of them. On May 1, police in Santa Marta arrested 22 alleged members of the organization , accused of working as hitmen, look-outs, and as collectors of extortion payment, among other jobs. Another alleged top leader of the organization was reported captured in February. Law enforcement authorities appear set on pursuing the Giraldos, and the group will likely face some significant struggles in attempting to recover from these blows. Nevertheless, the weakening of the Giraldos will likely have the side-effect of further strengthening the Urabenos' position in the Caribbean. This is one of the most strategically important areas for Colombian criminal groups, thanks to the ports which facilitate the international export of cocaine shipments, as well as a thriving trade in contraband petrol smuggled from Venezuela. The winding down of the Urabenos-Giraldos conflict should bring a welcome drop in violence in the region, but Colombian authorities still face the larger challenge of stopping the Urabenos from becoming the most powerful criminal syndicate in the country."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Drug Clashes Spark Humanitarian Crisis: Colombia Ombudsman. Colombia's Ombudsman's office says a struggle between guerrillas and neo-paramilitaries over drug routes through the Pacific department of Choco has caused a humanitarian crisis. These developments were likely put in motion by a security surge in a neighboring region. The Ombudsman's office raised a temporary alert in northern Choco as Marxist guerrilla groups the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) clashed with former narco-paramilitary group the Urabenos , reported El Espectador. At least five clashes have taken place in less than a week, and Jorge Enrique Calero, a director at the Ombudsman's office, said that 159 people from the town of Riociego were displaced after ""heavily armed men in uniforms"" occupied their homes. A temporary camp has been set up for the displaced victims. The fighting in Choco is likely the indirect result of security efforts against the Urabenos in their traditional stronghold, the sub-region of Uraba. A large portion of Uraba encircles the Gulf of Uraba, which connects with the Caribbean and was used by the Urabenos as their primary international drug route. But that has changed with the launch of ""Agamemnon ,"" a police operation targeting Urabenos leader Dario Antonio Usuga, alias ""Otoniel."" Headquartered in the town of Necocli -- once a primary drug-departure and arms-entry point for the Urabenos and their paramilitary predecessors -- Agamemnon counts on a force of roughly 1,500 police units and dedicated Blackhawk helicopter support. Although the operation has yet to catch Otoniel, it has succeeded in drastically curtailing Urabenos drug shipments passing through the Gulf of Uraba. In response, the criminal group has sent a significant number of operators into Choco, intelligence sources told InSight Crime. The Urabenos are particularly interested in securing rivers such as Rio Sucio and Rio Atrato, which could be used to access drug routes on Colombia's Pacific coast, the sources added. This has brought the Urabenos into conflict with Colombia's largest guerrilla group, the FARC, which traditionally conducts drug trafficking operations in these areas. The guerrillas have agreed to exit the drug trade as part of a possible peace agreement. However, recent field investigations by InSight Crime in the area indicate that FARC commanders are likely trying to stockpile drug money in anticipation of an end to the conflict. So while the FARC has been willing to cooperate with and sell coca base to the Urabenos in other areas of Colombia, their conflicting interests in Choco make fighting inevitable. For the moment the Urabenos may be benefiting from some lucky timing. Their incursions have reportedly brought them into conflict with the FARC's 57th Front, which has lost a series of commanders in recent years, including 36-year guerrilla veteran Jose David Suarez, alias ""El Becerro,"" in March. Sources in Panama and Colombia have told InSight Crime that former Panamanian police official Jose Luis Valencia Mosquera Asprilla, alias "" El Pana ,"" has replaced El Becerro, but the 57th Front remains in disarray. The dynamics could change rapidly however, as intelligence sources have told InSight Crime that FARC heavyweight Jose Benito Cabrera, alias "" Fabian Ramirez ,"" has been deployed to the area. Fabian Ramirez is credited with greatly advancing FARC drug operations in the southern department of Caqueta, in addition to a series of major military victories.

Disappearances Double in Mexico: Report. The rate of reported disappearances in Mexico during President Enrique Pena Nieto's administration has more than doubled since he took office, raising questions about the security achievements trumpeted by the president, as well as the methods of collecting data on these issues. Proceso said that on average 13 people were reported missing every day in Mexico from when Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 through October 2014. The number is more than twice the rate of 6 per day during the presidency of Felipe Calderon (2006 - 2012). These figures are based on a revised system engineered by Mexico's National Public Security Secretariat, according to Proceso. In total, 40 percent of the 23,272 disappearances -- or 9,384 -- that Mexico's missing persons registry (RNPED) reported between January 2007 and October 2014 came during the administration of Pena Nieto. The western state of Tamaulipas registered the highest number of disappearances from 2007 to 2014 with 5,293 cases (see graphic below in which higher rates of disappearances are a darker shade of red - source: RNPED), while Jalisco ranked second with 2,139. Pena Nieto has recently touted plummeting murder rates in Tamaulipas and Ciudad Juarez as evidence his security strategy in these violence-wracked states is working. However, the high number of disappeared in Tamaulipas suggests the lower murder rates may be due, in part, to the fact that bodies that are disappeared are not registered in homicide data. A similar phenomenon was registered in Colombia and in El Salvador. The discrepancy in the number of disappearances between the old and current tallying system also underscores just how subjective some security indicators can be. Under the old format, over 26,000 people were reported missing while Calderon was president; there is no data on the number who went missing during Pena Nieto's time in office using the old system. At times, a new or alternative method for measuring statistics plays a bigger factor than any government reform or change in criminal dynamics. The official number of reported kidnappings and murders in Mexico last year have already been questioned by watchdog groups and independent observers, which registered higher rates for both crimes. Under the government's former counting system, the RNPED would have probably registered an even higher number of missing persons during 2013 and 2014 -- both of which were record years for disappearances in Mexico. Increased rates of disappearance would do little to help the Mexican government's standing, which is already facing a credibility crisis due to the fallout from the missing students case last September in Guerrero, which reportedly involved dozens of police colluding with a criminal gang, on orders from the local mayor.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Holds Its Ground in Drug War of Words With US. Amid heated discord between the United States and Colombia regarding surging drug production in the South American country, Colombian officials are making it clear that they are not buckling under US pressure to harden the country's new, less draconian anti-narcotic strategies. In h is September 19 a ddress to the United Nations' General Assembly, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos reiterated his view that hard-line anti-drug strategies had failed, and that more progressive policies would yield better outcomes. ""I have said on many o ccasions that the war on drugs has not been won and neither is it being won, that we need new approaches, new strategies,"" Santos told the UN. The president also mentioned the need to ""have an open mind to be more intelligent, more innovative"" regarding drug policy, likely referring to Colombia's voluntary crop substitution programs, which US officials have critiqued in the past. Last year saw record cocaine production in Colombia, which has caused the US government to repeatedly voice its concerns about the South American country's anti-narcotic strategies. The United States has been ramping up the criticism of its long-time ally to an astonishing degree recently. On September 13, US President Donald Trump announced that his administration had "" seriously considered "" downgrading Colombia to a list of states failing to combat drug trafficking, alongside Venezuela and Bolivia. Colombian Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas responded to the warning by stating that Colombia is well on its way to achieving its ambitious drug crop eradication goal. He also said that the United States should be pulling more weight in terms of law enforcement. According to Villegas, in 2016 Colombia seized 44 times the amount of cocaine intercepted by US authorities. Santos' comments, which echo those he has made in the past, must be viewed in light of Colombia's ongoing clash over drug policy with the United States, perhaps its most important global partner. While top US officials under Trump have recognized their country's responsibility as a key drug market, the rhetoric about how to tackle this problem has been inconsistent , and has so far translated to domestic policies that focus more heavily on traditional anti-drug strategies rather than more progressive approaches. This preference for a heavier hand in counternarcotics efforts has also been seen at the international level, causing tension not only with Colombia, but also with Mexico, another key US partner. Meanwhile, the Colombian government has stood firm in defending its new policies, including its controversial pivot away from old, ultimately ineffective strategies such as aerial crop fumigation. And for now, the Santos administration has shown no intention of abandoning its new priority -- voluntary crop eradication -- despite the United States affirming it will not support the program. Nevertheless, Santos' administration is coming to an end. If other political factions come to power in next year's presidential elections, they may be more willing to accommodate US interests."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"How Street Gangs Have Complicated Mexico Security. A new report from a Washington think tank examines the complex role of youth gangs in Mexico's security challenges and offers recommendations to reduce their threat. In a report from the Wilson Center titled ""Understanding and addressing youth in 'gangs' in Mexico,"" Nathan Jones , a fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute, investigates how street gangs have influenced Mexico's broader security challenges, how their rise is reflective of a larger set of socioeconomic ills, and how the government may best combat their effects. (Jones' report was part of a series of working papers on civil engagement and public security in Mexico co-sponsored by the University of San Diego, including one co-authored by InSight Crime Co-director Steven Dudley. See other reports here .) Youth gangs play an important role in the local security landscape, one that has been evolving and growing more vital in recent years. As Jones notes, the gangs are increasingly working with larger trafficking organizations, but using a distinct operational model. ""Youth gangs, sometimes referred to as street gangs, typically control local turf for extortion and drug distribution,"" he writes. ""They engage in less profitable criminal activities than larger, more sophisticated, organized crime groups that focus on drug and arms trafficking and are more geographically dispersed."" While the affiliations between youth groups and larger groups like the Zetas are typically loose, there are some examples of a deeper association. For instance, near Mexico's southern border, the notorious Central American maras, namely Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Barrio 18, have formed alliances with some of the more prominent trafficking organizations, in which the smaller groups fulfill specific roles. One prominent example is the combined efforts of the Zetas and the MS13 in managing the human trafficking routes used by Central American immigrants on their way to the US. Closer to the northern border, it is not the maras, but rather gangs with a strong presence in US border regions that have often migrated south to work with the Mexican traffickers. For instance, thanks to the relationship between one gang leader and the Arellano Felix brothers, two California gangs -- Barrio Logan and the Mexican Mafia -- grew to take on a major role within the Tijuana Cartel's structure. These two groups helped supplant the Tijuana group's ranks amid an ongoing conflict with its rivals in the Sinaloa Cartel. A far more notorious example was El Paso's Barrio Azteca gang, which played a major role in the Juarez chaos starting in 2008. As InSight Crime has reported , Barrio Azteca was initially introduced to the dispute as a cohort of foot soldiers allied with La Linea, the armed wing of the Juarez Cartel. However, as the fighting raged on for years, and as the organizations fighting grew weaker, Barrio Azteca grew to be a key protagonist in its own right, as well as a significant driver of violence. As the case of Barrio Azteca in particular demonstrates, the growing importance of street gangs in Mexican organized crime is linked to a vicious cycle of violent conflicts: the street gangs are sources of manpower and revenue to help larger groups carry on a protracted war. Yet once they are involved, they become drivers of violence in their own right, making the war that precipitated their involvement even harder to resolve. Therefore, while most youth gangs maintain a significant distance from the larger DTOs, the involvement of larger street gangs in cartel conflicts becomes self-sustaining. In the vast majority of cases, Mexican street gangs have a much looser connection to the more notorious groups, but even so, they present an obstacle to a safer Mexico. Jones ties the persistent existence of thousands of such groups to a handful of socioeconomic ills endemic in Mexico, especially poverty and the explosion of idle young people dubbed the ""ni-nis"" (loosely translated as ""neither working nor studying""). A number of programs have shown some success in weakening the appeal of gangs. Typically, these channel efforts from the private sector, the government, and non-governmental organizations in order to address the broader social and economic problems. Jones highlights attempts from all realms of society to negotiate gang truces and create safe spaces as particularly promising, and he also calls for greater efforts to survey and study youth gangs. Some of the most effective gang programs have come under the umbrella of a larger security plan, namely Todos Somos Juarez, which featured a pair of programs targeting local gangs -- Entra21 and Youth Work: Mexico -- that aimed to endow locals with marketable job skills and to give them an alternative to gang life. While such programs do not, strictly speaking, fall under the realm of security policy, there is an important lesson in the role of the gangs in Juarez: the city turned into Mexico's most violent thanks in large part to the introduction into the Juarez-Sinaloa dispute of thousands of local gang members, and it turned into Mexico's biggest success story only after the government began to address the root causes of street gangs' allure. This does not necessarily mean that a similar approach to gangs would have the same results in other violent areas, and Barrio Azteca's activities represented just one ingredient in the Juarez chaos, but it would be short sighted not to apply Juarez's lessons elsewhere."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Brokerage Firm Accused of Laundering Drug Money. Colombian officials say that Interbolsa, a large brokerage firm that collapsed under mysterious circumstances last year, may have laundered money for international drug trafficking organizations. Colombia's Assistant Attorney General, Jorge Perdomo, said there were ""serious indications that Interbolsa laundered money."" Prosecutors in the country are reportedly investigating whether the firm oversaw transactions for drug traffickers including Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, the leader of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, and Daniel ""El Loco"" Barrera, formerly one of Colombia's most powerful criminals until his capture last year. Interbolsa once handled 50,000 clients before it was liquidated in November 2012. Since then, investigators have accused the firm of manipulating shares, fraud, and tax evasion. Lawmakers have also accused financial regulators of failing to take action regarding Interbolsa's shady business practices despite knowing about them for some time. Perdomo's remarks is among the most explicit assertions yet that Interbolsa handled cash linked to the drug trade. This will likely further boost suspicions that ""poor management"" is not the only reason the firm went under year. The ongoing investigation into Interbolsa's dealings will further highlight the need for better financial oversight in Colombia. This also became clear when Colombia arrested and extradited a select group of former brokers to the US last year, where they are accused of laundering cash on behalf of drug trafficking organizations. One of these brokers (who remains in Colombia for now) is Carlos Leyton Sinisterra, who at one point worked for two firms that were subsidiaries of Interbolsa. This raises additional questions about just how expansive was this network of Colombian brokerage firms which engaged in illicit activity."	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
"90% of those Arrested in Bogota Avoid Prison, Due to Weak System. More than 90 percent of those who are arrested in Bogota, Colombia, avoid prison sentences due to a system riddled with procedural errors, according to a report by El Tiempo newspaper. Some 9 percent of those detained in the capital end up behind bars, while another 3 percent are placed under house arrest, reports El Tiempo. There are several mechanisms built into Colombia's legal code that contribute to the high rate of impunity for criminals. For example, sentencing individuals for consecutive prison terms is not permitted, even for individuals convicted of multiple crimes. Additionally, crimes that carry a maximum sentence of less than four years are currently classified as ""bailable,"" which means that individuals accused of these crimes are not incarcerated during their pre-trial period. Procedural errors are also blamed for the high rate of impunity. The failure of prosecutors to present criminal indictments before the deadline, and errors made by police during the arrest process often prevent conviction, according to a judge interviewed for the article.

"US Report Shows Revitalized Central America Cocaine Corridor. The US State Department named seven Central American countries as havens for laundering the proceeds of drug trafficking and organized crime, and described the region as a main cocaine corridor for US markets, confirming the importance of Central America in the international drug trade. This is the first time since 2013 that the State Department has included Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama together in the list of primary money laundering countries that forms part of its annual International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR). An important development in the 2017 INSCR -- which refers to trends and statistics from the previous year -- is that El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua have re-entered the list of ""major money laundering countries,"" which the State Department defines as those ""whose financial institutions engage in currency transactions involving significant amounts of proceeds from international narcotics trafficking."" The INCSR explains that one of the main difficulties faced by Central American countries in combating money laundering is that their criminal investigation systems do not have the ability to trace money associated with drug trafficking or other types of criminal transactions. These include human or arms trafficking, or legal activities that are increasingly being used for money laundering, such as hosting high-level musical concerts or betting on popular sports. The United States considers Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama and El Salvador -- the latter dollarized since 2001 -- important financial centers where most money laundering occurs through banks. The case of Honduras is illustrative of the relationship between state agents and local crime syndicates. According to the report, ""Honduras is not a major financial center. Here, money laundering is mainly generated by traffic throughout the region. The trafficking of undocumented people to the United States, extortion, kidnapping and public corruption also generate significant amounts of money to be laundered."" Something similar, according to the report, is happening in Nicaragua. The report also reiterates that from the jungles of Panama's Darien region on the border with Colombia, to the Usumacinta River and the jungles of Peten in northern Guatemala, cocaine continues to flow freely by way of air, land and water. According to the INCSR, some 1,000 tons of cocaine were transported last year through Guatemala. This figure could be much higher if we take into account that, according to InSight Crime , Colombia, the main coca producing country in the world, transported about 1,350 tons of cocaine last year. Additionally, record opium poppy production numbers were recorded last year in Guatemala, presumably to supply the growing demand for heroin in the United States. In 2016, the Guatemalan government destroyed 17 million poppy plants. In Guatemala, and to a lesser extent in Honduras, there was an increase in the traffic of chemical precursors used to convert opium poppy into heroin, but also in those used to convert coca leaves into cocaine hydrochloride. The figures published by the United States reveal a fact that seems obvious, but that is sometimes obscured by the dynamics of violence in Central America, especially in the Northern Triangle region: Drug trafficking, as well as much of the state corruption that protects traffickers, continues to be the main driver of flourishing criminal economies in the Central American isthmus. Since the middle of the last decade, Central American drug traffickers have evolved from being simple ""transporters"" who collected cocaine from Colombia at the porous borders of Costa Rica and Panama to then move it on to Guatemala. These groups have begun to diversify their criminal enterprises. Traditional groups such as the Lorenzanas in Guatemala, the Matta Ballesteros network in Honduras and the Perrones in El Salvador have joined up with more specialized money laundering groups. One of these is El Salvador's Cartel de Texis, whose leader, Jose Adan Salazar Umana, holds a White House designation as an international drug kingpin and has been investigated by the Attorney General of El Salvador for money laundering. However, the Honduran case best illustrates how criminal actors in the drug trade permeated the political ranks of these countries and, as InSight Crime has pointed out , received favors and protection from them. Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, the former leader of the Cachiros in Honduras, recently accused former President Porfirio Lobo of having received bribes from his group, something that the politician has been quick to deny. In El Salvador, drug trafficking groups have made similar accusations: Perrones operators have also said they paid bribes to former President Antonio Saca, who is currently being held on corruption charges. Guatemala remains, however, the crown jewel in the Central American drug trafficking landscape. Last month, the United States accused former President Roxana Baldetti and former Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla of conspiring to ship cocaine into the United States. The State Department report has once again highlighted the revitalization of Central America's narco-trafficking corridor, which had reached one of its last peaks in mid-2009 after a military coup in Honduras helped open the air route between that country and Venezuela. After that, US officials and analysts talked about the possibility of a resurgence of Caribbean drug routes, but that did not happen, at least not in the same way that it happened in Central America. Today, due to an increase in coca production in Colombia and the infiltration of criminal groups at the highest levels of political power, especially in the Northern Triangle, it is clear that entry and exit avenues for drugs and illicit money are working at full throttle."	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Colombia Prison Riot Deaths Put Spotlight on Overcrowding. Ten inmates died and around 40 more were injured during a riot and a fire in a northern Colombia prison, highlighting chronic overcrowding in the country's jails and prompting calls for reform. The deaths and injuries occurred on the evening of January 27 in the Modelo prison in the Caribbean coastal city of Barranquilla, after a confrontation between inmates and guards led to the use of tear gas, rioting and a fire, reported Semana. Six inmates died at the scene, and four others en route to the hospital, while up to 43 were injured. The cause of the deaths has not yet been confirmed. According to AFP , the fire may have been caused by prisoners burning sleeping mats. El Espectador reported police fired tear gas into areas where the fire was already burning. According to Semana, the prison was housing more than twice the number of prisoners it had capacity for at the time of the incident -- with 1,123 inmates in a prison built for 454. The wing where the riot and fire took place was particularly overcrowded, with 731 prisoners housed in a zone intended for 196 -- representing 273 percent capacity. While AFP reported this was Colombia's first prison riot to result in deaths since 2000, the event has drawn attention to the chronic overcrowding of the country's jails. Justice Minister Alfonso Gomez Mendez called the event ""a shame,"" while the governor of Atlantico -- the state where Barranquilla is located -- called for prison reform. A new prison code that entered into effect in Colombia earlier in January aims to combat this kind of overcrowding by allowing prisoners doing time for minor crimes to leave early and complete their sentences under house arrest, reported El Tiempo. While this is the first deadly riot to take place in a Colombian prison in over a decade, the country's prison system has been no stranger to criticism in recent years. The National Prison Institute (INPEC) has come under fire for the favorable conditions enjoyed by drug traffickers and corrupt politicians, among others, leading to calls for the body to be dissolved. Prison overcrowding is a problem throughout much of the region. The most overcrowded penitentiaries are found in Bolivia and El Salvador , while chronic overcrowding resulting in violence and prison breaks has also been noted in Venezuela , Mexico , Ecuador and much of Central America. One of the key criticisms aimed at overcrowded prisons -- beyond the obvious public health and human rights concerns -- is that they generate extreme violence and act as excellent recruitment centers for street gangs and criminal organizations."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Why Have Battles Between Mexico Marines and Criminals Doubled?Confrontations between Mexico's marines and criminal groups have doubled over a sixteen-month period, showing the extent to which the authorities have come to rely on the armed forces in the face of the corruption and ineffectiveness of local and federal police According to figures from Mexico's Secretary of the Navy (Semar), marines were involved in a total of 70 confrontations with alleged criminal groups between January 2013 and April 2014, compared to only 35 between 2010 and 2012, reported Milenio. Between 2006 and 2009, Semar did not report any clashes with criminal groups. Tamaulipas was the most dangerous state for marines over the recent 16-month period, with 10 confrontations reported in 2013 and 18 in the first four months of 2014 -- forty percent of the total figure. Coahuila saw a total of 8 clashes over the same period, while 7 occurred in Michoacan (see Milenio map below). Between January and April 2014, marines killed 29 alleged criminals without suffering any casualties. There are several possible explanations for the spike in confrontations between the marines and criminal groups. The increase could be caused by more aggressive tactics on the part of either security forces or drug cartels. For example, the fact that a large percentage of the clashes occurred in Tamaulipas could be partly explained by the aggressive tactics employed by the Zetas, who operate in the state and have been known to provoke battles with security forces. However, a major factor is likely because of the increased role of the marines in fighting organized crime, with the authorities using them instead of local and federal police forces , which have proven particularly susceptible to corruption. In the operation to capture Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias ""El Chapo"" earlier this year, for example, officials relied on an elite marines force to avoid risking infiltrations by criminal groups through local police or other law enforcement bodies. US authorities reportedly prefer to work with Mexico's marines because of their perceived lack of corruption, and have collaborated with them to track down cartel leaders such as Arturo Beltran Leyva. The lack of marine casualties between January and April 2014, however, raises questions about what the reported confrontations with criminal groups have involved, as such unbalanced figures can be indicative of killings rather than clashes. Semar forces have been linked to disappearances in Mexico , and human rights groups have previously raised concerns that the military is perpetrating extrajudicial killings ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Promises More Social Aid for Gang Truce. As part of a new phase in El Salvador's gang truce, the president pledged additional funds for the reintegration of gang members into mainstream society, something which has been sorely lacking from the truce so far. President Mauricio Funes said $18 million would be spent creating cooperatives in the country's peace zones -- areas where gang members have pledged to cease all criminal activity -- which would provide social reinsertion opportunities. Another $4.3 million will be invested in giving gang members access to education, plus $9.3 million to provide health care. A final $798,000 will be spent on violence prevention measures. ""The truce has not failed,"" said President Funes, responding to recent comments from the Catholic Church and politicians that the pact negotiated between the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and the Barrio 18 had not brought about the improvements promised. News of investment in social reinsertion programs is very welcome, as providing alternative, legal income sources for gang members is crucial to the truce's longterm sustainability. Members of both gangs rely on extortion to make a living for themselves and their families, and the government has so far failed to make good on promises to provide employment opportunities. While murder rates have seen a dramatic drop since the truce began, extortion has risen , while gang members have complained alternatives are lacking. Whether $18 million will be enough to provide decent options for the 64,000 gang members thought to operate in El Salvador (according to police data) is questionable, but it is nonetheless a good start."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Central America Unprepared for Wave of Synthetic Drugs. Evidence suggests that Mexican cartels are not only deepening their drug trafficking activities in Central America but may be diversifying into synthetic drugs like ecstasy, methamphetamine and LSD, for consumption both in the region and abroad. On January 4, while on patrol near the Usumacinta river in the remote province of Peten, a Guatemalan military patrol came under fire from a group of smugglers. After a brief firefight the gunmen fled by boat, leaving their goods behind. This incident is far from unusual in Peten, a region which has become a haven for Mexican drug traffickers in recent years. What stands out, however, is their merchandise: 65 tons of dimethyl formaldehyde, otherwise known as acetone. Because of its properties as a solvent, the chemical is used by drug producers to make methamphetamine. The find is part of a growing trend in Central America, where the production of synthetic drugs like methamphetamine, ecstasy (MDMA), and LSD is becoming more and more common. Guatemala appears to be at the center of this shift. Just one day before the Peten incident, Guatemalan officials announced that they had seized 160 tons of precursor chemicals used to make synthetic drugs in a shipping container along the Caribbean port of Santo Tomas de Castilla. Both incidents came days after the Associated Press published a report on methamphetamine precursor chemicals in the country. In 2011, Guatemalan authorities seized about 1,600 tons of these chemicals, four times the amount confiscated in 2010. Much of the trade is thought to be controlled by the Sinaloa Cartel. According to the AP, the group could be producing as much as or more of the drug in Guatemala as in Mexico, which analysts usually consider the top source of US-bound meth. Meth production is a concern in other Central American countries as well. In 2008, Honduran officials uncovered a large-scale drug lab used to make methamphetamine and ecstasy, disguised as a luxury funeral parlor. If production takes off in Honduras, it could be hard to control. Law enforcement officials are already concerned that Honduras is becoming the largest transit nation for cocaine in the region. Meanwhile, domestic use of stimulants like meth is on the rise in Central America, with 1.3 percent of the adult population having used some form of amphetamine, according to the 2011 UNODC World Drug Report. The three countries where amphetamine was most common were El Salvador (3.3 percent), Belize (1.4 percent) and Panama (1.2 percent). By comparison, the prevalence of amphetamine use among individuals 12 and older in the United States (known for its large meth market) in 2009 was 1.2 percent. The main concern about this trend is the region's weak state institutions and notoriously porous legal systems. While the U.S. has attempted to strengthen state power in the region through the multi-million dollar Central America Regional Security Initiative ( CARSI ), governments in the region claim that the money is not enough to increase intelligence, professionalize their security forces and strengthen their justice systems. The wave of synthetic drugs brings with it an entirely new set of problems as well. As InSight Crime has reported , the wide variety of legitimate uses for precursor chemicals make it hard for states to effectively crack down on their illicit use. What's more, their volatility can make them difficult to dispose of safely , presenting an incentive for corrupt elements of security forces to sell them on the black market. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Series of Escapes Underscores Weakness of Honduras Prison System. Sixty-five people escaped from prison in less than 15 days in Honduras, highlighting the chronic dysfunction of the country's prison system. Honduras has recently witnessed a wave of prison breaks with a total of 65 inmates escaping from three penitentiaries between April 28 and May 11, reported El Heraldo. The latest incident occurred on May 11, when 23 members of the Barrio 18 gang escaped from the Tamara prison in circumstances that remain unclear. The escape was not publicly reported by national prisons director Rosa Gudiel until May 13. Authorities believe some of the inmates might have escaped to avoid being transferred to maximum security prisons, El Heraldo reported separately. Cesar Najera, the head of the Tamara prison, was temporarily suspended from his post while a probe is ongoing. Several prison guards responsible for the areas where the escape took place have been arrested and are under investigation. This prison break at Tamara follows several similar incidents at other detention facilities. On April 28, at least 30 members of the ""Chirizos"" gang and the Barrio 18 escaped from a juvenile correction center. Nine of them were recaptured shortly thereafter. However, another 10 youths managed to escape from the center less than two weeks later. In addition, another prison break was reported at the Choluteca facility on May 12, when two inmates broke free. The fact that 65 inmates could escape in the space of just two weeks -- an average of four per day -- is staggering, even for a country with a chronic prison crisis like Honduras. As InSight Crime has previously reported , penitentiaries across the region, including in Honduras, have become incubators for organized crime groups. Overcrowding, which is a major contributing factor for criminality in prisons, reached an estimated 162 percent in Honduras in August 2016, according to the London-based Institute for Criminal Policy Research (ICPR). The high number of people in prison is likely a result of the heavy-handed approach to public security embraced by Honduran authorities. But it also underscores a failure to distinguish between convicts and individuals incarcerated before trial. As of 2016, the number of pretrial detainees had reached 9,100 -- 53 percent of the total prison population, according to the ICPR. Amid severe overcrowding and dire living conditions , gangs have taken control of the penitentiaries, and reportedly carry out criminal activities from behind bars. In response, in September 2016 President Hernandez announced ""a profound restructuring"" of the country's penitentiary system. That same month, El Pozo, a new maximum-security facility in the department of Santa Barbara, began to host its first inmates. But as InSight Crime has warned , if authorities fail to eradicate corruption among prison guards and promote necessary judicial reforms, these efforts may not yield the expected results."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"What Is Behind the Recent Wave of Violence in Mexico City?The discovery of two dismembered bodies in downtown Mexico City, the most recent in a series of violent acts, contradicts official declarations denying the presence of organized crime in the capital and reveals details about the city's new criminal dynamics. Early on June 17, two dismembered bodies were discovered on Avenida Insurgentes, one of the most heavily traveled routes in Mexico City. A ""narcomanta"" -- a banner used by criminal groups to make announcements and threats -- was also found on the scene. The banner contained a message threatening Jorge Flores Concha, alias ""El Tortas."" Flores is the alleged leader of Fuerza Anti-Union, an organization responsible for killing several people linked to Union de Tepito, which is one of the most notorious criminal groups in the city. Newspaper El Universal reported that seven security cameras monitor the location where the remains were found from different angles. However, none of them were able to capture the moment when the bodies were placed and the narcomanta was hung up, which has motivated local authorities to investigate the possible participation of officials from the city's Public Security Secretariat (Secretaria de Seguridad Publica - SPP). Two days after the appearance of the banner, shootings and executions occurred at various points throughout the city, leaving at least seven dead. In a press conference, Mexico City's head of government Jose Ramon Amieva confirmed that a dispute between Union de Tepito and Fuerza Anti-Union has been causing the recent violence in the capital. He added that cartels operating in other states such as Jalisco, Guerrero and Morelos are providing the rival groups with weapons and drugs. Union and Anti-Union While Mexico City authorities have traditionally denied the presence of large organized criminal groups in the capital, evidence demonstrates the contrary. Many local groups tied to organizations present in other Mexican states are operating in the city. The center of the capital has been La Union territory for several years. As InSight Crime reported in 2013, La Union was initially formed with old members from the Familia Michoacana and the Beltran Leyva Organization as a defense against the then Tepito Cartel and other groups linked to the Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel. The number of bars, nightclubs, stores and street vendors that abound in the center of Mexico City make it the perfect place for La Union to thrive, given that it specializes in microtrafficking, extortion and even human trafficking. Journalist Carlos Acuna, who covers this area of the capital, told InSight Crime that the increase in organized crime has been intertwined with the rapid and uncontrolled proliferation of bars and nightclubs. Petty drug dealers operate in many of these businesses, and the owners are often threatened and extorted by members of La Union. Acuna said that there have been cases where employees at the establishments are hired by the criminal group as lookouts known as ""halcones"" (literally ""falcons"") or dealers. ""Many can't report [these crimes] because they don't even have a license to operate,"" the journalist said. The recent entrance of the Fuerza Anti-Union in Mexico City's underworld has been explained by two theories. One is that the organization came about as a vigilante group to violently combat the Union de Tepito's extortion of business owners. Another posits that Fuerza Anti-Union splintered off from Union de Tepito, that the former has ties to the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion - CJNG), and that the two groups are disputing microtrafficking and extortion territory in the city. What is known is that, since the conflict began in December 2017, there have been at least seven executions of members from both gangs in which the bodies were placed on public roads. Exhibition of Violence: A Future Trend? Violence between criminal groups in Mexico City is not new, but it is unusual for it to be displayed in such heavily traveled areas as Avenida Insurgentes, which is regularly monitored and has state presence. El Universal journalist David Fuentes, who covers organized crime in Mexico City, told InSight Crime that criminal groups have gained strength in the city because capital authorities have been soft-pedaling the issue. ""If a criminal group manages to place dismembered bodies and a narcomanta in such a heavily-guarded area without being caught, it's because it has already reached another level,"" he said. However, security analyst Jaime Lopez thinks it is still too early to say whether this exhibition of violence in Mexico City can be considered a trend, though he does not rule out the possibility. ""It's possible that a new form of stronger and more public organized crime is growing in Mexico City,"" he told InSight Crime. ""The problem is that, as opposed to other states in the country, the response to the violence in Mexico City is stronger and more immediate,"" he said. ""So continued public violence is not a good strategy [for criminal groups]. If it becomes a trend, it would be bad news [for them]."""	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Mexico Gas Vendors Forced to Buy Fuel Stolen by Gangs. According to Mexico's national association of gas businesses, criminal groups reportedly force gasoline vendors to buy stolen fuel, calling attention to the increased availability of stolen gas in Mexico service stations. On June 15, the National Organization of Petroleum Retailers (Onexpo) filed a complaint with the Mexican Attorney General's Office, alleging that criminal groups are forcing gas station owners to sell fuel stolen from the pipelines of state oil company Pemex. Gas vendors have reportedly faced threats in many states where criminal groups are most active, including Coahuila, Veracruz, Nuevo Leon, and Michoacan. According to Onexpo, one of the states most affected is Zacatecas, better known for its mining industry. In recent years, Pemex has struggled with rising fuel theft. In 2011, nearly three million barrels of petroleum, valued at roughly $475 million, were stolen from Pemex. The thefts were an increase of 52 percent from the previous year. Much of the increased theft has been blamed on organized crime. Pemex has filed multiple lawsuits against foreign oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell for buying fuel stolen by Mexican cartels. The Zetas in particular are believed to have become increasingly involved in fuel theft, as highlighted by the recent discovery of over 1.5 million liters of stolen oil in Veracruz, a Zetas stronghold. Most of the prominent cases of fuel theft in Mexico have involved the sale of stolen fuel to local and US refineries, or other bulk users of gas in Mexico. The sale of stolen fuel in ordinary gas stations is a newer phenomenon. While Onexpo's allegations apparently suggests that criminal groups have become more aggressive in forcing service stations to buy stolen wares, it is also possible that the business association filed the complaint in part to protect vendors from accusations of knowingly buying illegal fuel. Either way, Onexpo's complaint does suggest the thieves are increasingly using local gas stations in Mexico as a primary distributor for their stolen product. This means not only will Pemex have to increase their monitoring of the oil pipelines targeted by thieves, but the company may also have to expand their audits of stations across Mexico. 	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Chile Human Trafficking Rings Use Ecuador-Peru Routes. Officials have revealed details of new trends concerning human trafficking in Chile, as this otherwise relatively safe country's strong economy continues to draw vulnerable immigrants into exploitation. Since the introduction of anti-trafficking legislation in 2011, trafficking rings have adopted new tactics, according to officials cited by newspaper La Tercera. A police analysis showed that one of the principal routes involved bringing people in through northern Chile on tourist visas. Victims typically pass through Ecuador, then Peruvian capital Lima, before entering Chile, with trafficking rings typically charging between $1,000 to $3,000 per person. Chile's Assistant Secretary of the Interior Rodrigo Ubilla said nearly all routes passed first through Peru, even if the victims originated from places such as the Dominican Republic and Haiti. According to Mauricio Fernandez, the director of Chile's money laundering unit, Chile's economic stability makes the country attractive to potential immigrants, who because of their vulnerable situation often end up as victims of human trafficking schemes. Fernandez said that, as with other human trafficking networks in the region, ""coyotes"" are paid to transport the illegal immigrants. The Chilean-based coyotes typically operate in airports, as well as the northern border region. Human trafficking networks in Latin America involve a significant number of victims from outside the western hemisphere, including East Asia, according to the United Nations' 2012 report on global human trafficking. La Tercera's report highlighted this reality, pointing out that recent cases of human trafficking in Chile have involved Pakistani and Chinese immigrants. East Asian and South American trafficking rings have also recently been dismantled in Brazil and Ecuador. Nevertheless, the majority of human trafficking within Latin America is intraregional. It is unsurprising therefore that Chile's most popular trafficking flows move first through Ecuador and Peru, as Ecuador is considered an attractive transit nation, due in part to its loose immigration controls, while Peru has also struggled to contain the problem. Chile is rarely considered an important hub in the trade, although the US State Departmant has stated that the country ""does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking,"" although it is making ""a significant effort"" to change this. Chile's good economic standing makes the prospect of working there appealing for trafficking victims, who are typically lured by false advertisements of well-paying jobs in a new country and duped into paying high fees to traffickers, only to be stripped of their freedom and documents upon arrival.

"Guatemala Targets Health Care Corruption Ring. Authorities in Guatemala arrested 11 people accused of running a corruption ring within the country's social security agency, as prosecutors continue their campaign to break up a criminal network that allegedly stole millions of dollars and caused sick patients to die as a result of faulty medical care. The International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and the Attorney General's Office announced the arrests on October 27. At the heart of the scandal is Guatemala's social security agency, known by its Spanish acronym as the IGSS. According to the CICIG and the Attorney General, pharmaceutical companies would negotiate lucrative contracts with their IGSS contacts, such as getting the IGSS to buy a certain type of antibiotic in bulk. In return for issuing the multi-million dollar contracts, IGSS officials allegedly received financial kickbacks. During the press conference, Attorney General Thelma Aldana said the investigation still hasn't established how much money the IGSS embezzled this way. ""What we do know is this was a daily event between November 2014 to April 2015,"" she said, according to ElPeriodico. One of the main leaders of the corruption ring is allegedly Gustavo Alejos, the ex-secretary of former President Alvaro Colom. Alejos is linked to three pharmaceutical companies that supplied drugs to the IGSS. He remains at large, although 11 other suspects -- including pharmaceutical providers, IGSS officials, and hospital directors -- are in custody, charged with illicit association, illicit enrichment, and influence peddling. Prosecutors played dozens of phone recordings of conversations between the suspects in court on October 28, as Prensa Libre reported. In one recording, a pharmaceutical company director told an IGSS official, ""Who doesn't want to win, if health is a business?"" Other phone recordings made reference to alias ""JD,"" who, according to the Attorney General's Office, could be a reference to Juan de Dios Rodriguez, the former head of the IGSS. Rodriguez was arrested in May 2015 , charged with approving a lucrative contract with a pharmaceutical company and pocketing a commission. The pharmaceutical company provided the IGSS with generic drugs that failed to adequately treat kidney failure, resulting in the deaths of at least 11 people. This latest investigation comes as additional proof that the CICIG -- which was established in Guatemala with backing from the United Nations in 2006 -- has made major advances in training prosecutors in successfully building cases. Many of the CICIG's investigations this year -- including the one that brought down President Otto Perez Molina -- has relied on more technical evidence like phone recordings , rather than depending on witness testimony. Still, as with the ongoing case against Perez Molina and his former vice president , it remains to be seen whether these investigations will actually result in convictions that the courts do not later overturn. Moving forward, the CICIG and the Attorney General's Office would do well to continue prioritizing probes into malfeasance within the IGSS. With a mutli-billion dollar budget, this is Guatemala's biggest government agency, and as InSight Crime has reported , it is known for awarding lucrative contracts as a way to manipulate political power. There have been few previous investigations into IGSS corruption, arguably in part due to the agency's influence over who gets appointed to the country's courts."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Shining Path Leader Offers Rare Glimpse Into Peru Drug Trade. After Shining Path leader Felix Huachaca Tincopa, alias ""Roberto,"" was captured in late 2010, he provided authorities with a nearly unmatched amount of detail about the rebels' secretive drug trafficking operations. IDL Reporteros examines what this account reveals about the state of Peru's cocaine trade. Roberto, as his story goes, was originally deployed to Peru's Upper Huallaga region to wrest control of the area from a rival Shining Path group, led by Florindo Eleuterio Flores Hala, alias ""Comrade Artemio."" Tincopa's group, based further south in the Apurimac and Ene River Valley (known as the VRAE), is thought to be an apolitical faction of the Shining Path more heavily involved in the drug trade, although its leadership disputes this claim. However, Roberto's detailed testimony paints a picture more of a group focused on economic survival, rather than the Shining Path's traditional Maoist values. The following is InSight Crime's translation of extracts from IDL-Reporteros' two-part series on Peru's drug trade, "" The Cocaine Clans "": It was an exceptional circumstance. Since the capture of ""Feliciano"" in July 1999, a Shining Path leader of this level had not been interrogated. And ""Roberto"" was ready to talk, and he did, with thoroughness and detail. Huachaca was forcibly recruited by the Shining Path in 1987 but was quickly incorporated as an active member in the organization and ascended both in position and responsibility. For four years (from 2003), he collected extortion fees for the Shining Path from wood trafficking in the Vizcatan zone. In 2007 he led the attacks against the Ocobamba police station and on a patrol on the Luricocha-Huanta highway. One of the most important questions [during Roberto's interrogation with police] was about how the VRAE faction of the Shining Path financed itself. Between 2003 and 2006 -- Huachaca Tincopa says -- ""the principal source of financing of the organization was the collection of 'war taxes' from formal and informal loggers who collected wood in the zone of Vizcatan and the Ene Valley."" Each formal business payed 5,000 soles a month [about $2,000 today] to the VRAE faction. Huachaca Tincopa was also in charge of extorting the informal miners: 50 cents [about 20 US cents today] per foot of mahogany. In this way, he generally collected about 5,000 soles a month. ""Starting in 2006,"" Huachaca Tincopa says, ""the source of financing for our organization was drug trafficking."" This does not mean they stopped extorting loggers, but that, as will be seen, the amount provided by drug trafficking was greater. How did the VRAE faction receive money from drug trafficking? ""First, by allowing passage to the smugglers who had to move through Vizcatan The leader of each group of smugglers had to give to the comrade responsible a sum of $4 per kilo of drugs, whether cocaine paste or chlorhydrate."" While he was there he observed that ""every day four or five groups of some ten ""backpackers,"" [also known in Spanish as ""cargachos""], passed through, each of whom carried between 10 and 15 kilograms of drugs, in the prevailing method of ""ant smuggling"" [moving drugs in very small amounts] cocaine from the valley. The Shining Path gave them lodging and food in Bidon, where they had to surrender their arms and their cargo, which were kept as deposits. Both were returned to them before they left. But the Shining Path charged an extortion fee for each kilo of drugs, as it had also done for each log felled in its sector."" This, what's more, was not the only way the Shining Path made money from drug trafficking. As ""Robert"" said, "" We, as members of the 'Party', transported drug shipments from the zone of Bidon heading toward Huachocolpa or Tintay Puncu or through Huanta. For each shipment of drugs one received a sum of $30 per kilo, be it cocaine paste of chlorhydrate."" The route through Bidon-Vizcatan closed in 2008 after the intervention of the armed forces, as ""Roberto"" remembers. According to other trusted sources that IDL-R has consulted, the Shining Path's route moved to the north of the VRAE. According to these sources, the VRAE faction now guards shipments of more than half a ton, that generally have multiple owners. The cost of protection has grown and now fluctuates between $50 and $60 per kilogram. Every shipment of a half ton represents a maximum income of $30,000 for the VRAE faction. What other drug-related income has the Shining Path had? Between 2005 and 2006, ""Roberto"" said, the VRAE faction had four hectares of coca leaf cultivation in Parhua and Nazangaro [sic], even a drug processing laboratory. They were, as ""Roberto"" Huachaca indicates, minor operations. ""I have understood that in the two cases drugs were obtained, in each process they obtained five kilos. The laboratory stopped working when we destroyed it"" because ""by applying the wrong dose of medicine we thus made a bad investment and the Directorate decided that guarding and transporting drug shipments was more cost-effective,"" Roberto said According to this information, which has been corroborated by other witnesses and also by National Police officials, the VRAE faction has had (and probably mantains) drug trafficking income that fluctuate between $50,000 and $100,000 a month. A qualified source indicated to IDL-R that although a good percentage of the VRAE faction's income is sustained by drug trafficking, ""Not all the drugs that leave the VRAE are controlled by the Shining Path. They only control 30 percent of the drug exports."" Another source confirms this affirmation. According to [the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, UNODC]'s most recent monitoring of coca cultivation, the VRAE has the highest concentration of coca production in the country with 19,723 hectares of coca, that represent 32.2 percent of the nation's 61,200 hectares. In the last two years there has been an apparent regression in the type of drug exported from the VRAE. Now less chlorhydrate, and more cocaine paste, is exported than in the past. This seems paradoxical, as cocaine chlorhydrate sells for a higher price. The explanation for this is that various bosses of the family clans of the VRAE have extended their operations to Bolivia. Now, the initial part of the process (up to the processing of cocaine paste) is performed in the VRAE and the rest in Bolivia, where the paste is refined to chlorhydrate, saving on the cost of precursor chemicals and fetching a higher price for the cocaine. This occurred because, according to a qualified source of IDL-Reporteros, ""Bolivia is a sieve. There's no control, it's a no man's land. The precursor chemicals are cheaper and of better quality in Bolivia, where there are many small cocaine chlorhydrate laboratories."" Other sources confirmed this affirmation. The clans gain much in the process of internationalization: they lower costs and reduce risks. Diverse expert sources indicated that now around 70 percent of the drugs produced in the VRAE goes south, as cocaine paste. ""There are mixed organizations. There are Peruvians who have associated with Bolivians,"" another source told IDL-R. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexicos La Tuta Acts as Judge In Latest Knights Templar Video. The latest video installment from Mexico's Knights Templar leader ""La Tuta"" shows the drug lord dividing up the inheritance of a deceased local businessman, illustrating how the criminal group has assumed social and judicial functions in the state of Michoacan. In the video (see below), Knights Templar leader Servando Gomez Martinez, alias ""La Tuta,"" divides the inheritance of Luis Miguel Estefan among five individuals, including the late businessman's wife and two brothers. Wearing his characteristic baseball cap and glasses, La Tuta stumbles awkwardly through the proceedings, forgetting names and gesticulating aggressively with a pen. After dividing up Estefan's properties -- which included four houses, a restaurant, and a hotel -- La Tuta states that the businessman's relatives also have to make a ""donation"" of over $450,000 to the criminal group. Then the cartel leader asks each of the relatives to state that they agreed to the division of assets while looking straight into the camera. This video follows several other recently released Knights Templar recordings, including that of a Michoacan mayor asking for the group's help in investigating her son-in-law's murder, and a video of the son of former governor Fausto Vallejo talking to La Tuta. The most recent video demonstrates how the Knights are so deeply embedded in Michoacan society that they not only run criminal activities, but have also taken on social and judicial roles -- albeit for their own profit -- and are accepted as arbiters in legal matters. It is likely in part La Tuta's ties to the local community that have allowed him to evade capture. While it is unclear who released the footage or why, it adds to an ever expanding catalogue of Knights Templar videos. The videos often function as an unusual form of publicity with the group attempting to portray itself as a ""brotherhood"" with a strict moral code that seeks to protect the people of Michoacan. There were also elements of this in the most recent video, with La Tuta talking about dividing up the properties based on moral -- rather than legal -- grounds. The Knights Templar also appear to use videos as leverage with political figures, such as former governor Vallejo's son Rodrigo, who was arrested after the release of the video of his meeting with La Tuta."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Gang-Enforced Bus Strike Increases Pressure on El Salvador Govt. El Salvador's gangs have reportedly enforced a transportation strike, paralyzing capital city San Salvador as they attempt to push the government into a new round of truce negotiations. On July 27, gangs in El Salvador ordered bus drivers to go on strike, killing six transportation workers and burning two buses that refused to comply, reported Reuters. In response to gang threats, buses stopped offering service on at least 37 routes , affecting San Salvador and surrounding areas. El Salvador's Vice Ministry of Transport (VMT) estimated around 1,000 busses had stopped running. The strike has affected the daily commute of thousands of Salvadorans , with people renting cars, traveling in the back of pickup trucks, or walking long distances to arrive at their destinations. For those transportation workers willing to break the strike, El Salvador's National Police (PNC) has promised "" permanent protection ,"" and mobilized officers to provide security at bus terminals, bus stops, and along bus routes. The MS13 and Barrio 18 in El Salvador have been calling for the government to once again engage in dialogue with their leaders, saying violence will continue to rise until this happens. So far, however, the government has adamantly refused to do so. Instead, authorities have adopted a confrontational approach towards the gangs in the face of rising violence. Indeed, the gangs' ordering of the transportation strike is likely a response to recent moves by the government to limit imprisoned gang members' contact with the outside world. It also serves as a demonstration of the gangs' strength , and their ability to significantly disrupt day-to-day civilian life. This puts additional public pressure on the government to take action against rising insecurity. The questions remains whether El Salvador's security situation will continue to worsen before it starts improving, or whether the government will eventually be forced to engange in dialogue with the gangs once again. This is something the state has been reluctant to do (or at least publicly acknowledge), for fear of appearing weak and granting the gangs semi-legitimate status as political actors. Such a scenario, however, is not without precedent. Unconfirmed reports have recently emerged from Brazil, alleging that the government of Sao Paulo negotiated with leaders of the First Capital Command (PCC) gang in 2006, in order to end an outbreak of violence ."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Criminal Attack Isolates Towns in Security-Challenged Guerrero, Mexico. Public transportation connecting the mountain region with the center of Mexico's Guerrero state has been suspended after a criminal group detained several vehicles, underscoring the security challenges faced by the central government in this state and in neighboring Michoacan. The suspension of transportation services in the region followed an August 23 attack in which a criminal group intercepted and detained four vehicles, reported Proceso. Residents of the municipality of Tlacotepec told Proceso there was a criminal group dedicated to kidnappings, robbery and extortion operating along the route connecting them with the main highway that stretches between Acapulco in Guerrero and Mexico City. The security situation reportedly deteriorated following the withdrawal of a military unit that was stationed in the area. According to Proceso, the lack of transportation has caused shortages of fuel and food in 80 local communities. Residents have said they are afraid to leave the area due to the possibility of further attacks. This comes as authorities continue to grapple with security threats in neighboring Michoacan, where two mass graves containing a total of 11 bodies were discovered on August 23, reported Univision. Meanwhile, the former leader of Michoacan's rural defense force -- Luis Antonio Torres Gonzalez, alias ""El Americano"" -- will be forced to testify before the state Attorney General's office about the nature of his relationship with Knights Templar leader Servando Gomez, alias ""La Tuta"" after a video emerged of a meeting between the two, reported Milenio. Another Michoacan public figure, former Mayor Salma Karrum Cervantes, has been missing since a video of her meeting with a local Knights Templar leader began circulating 24 days ago. Michoacan and Guerrero are two states that represent major security challenges for Mexico's government. In both places, criminal groups have produced widespread violence, with Guerrero registering the highest homicide rate of any state in 2013. Michoacan's violence has largely been attributed to the Knights Templar, but homicides have continued to rise amid the power vacuum created by the group's demise. In Guerrero, a variety of criminal gangs are battling for control. Both states are also home to self-defense militias, purportedly created to defend the local population from drug cartels. While Guerrero's vigilante groups have existed for many years, in both states there have been signs of the movements fracturing and some elements exacerbating the delicate security situation in the region. Although Mexican authorities have sent federal troops to Michoacan and attempted to institutionalize the state's vigilante movement , the security situation in Guerrero has largely been neglected. In one town where transportation was suspended, Proceso reported that only three police officers operate currently."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Guyana Call for Help Shows Limited Capacity to Combat Drug Threat. Authorities in Guyana have called on international law enforcement bodies to assist them with investigations in the wake of a transnational drug bust, in a move demonstrating the country's limited capacity to combat a growing organized crime problem. According to Caribbean360 , a case implicating a Guyanese shipping company in cocaine trafficking has prompted Guyanese President Donald Ramotar to seek foreign assistance in fully exploring the extent of local involvement in the network. The report comes less than a week after news broke of a billion dollar drug trafficking network involving factions of the Italian and Italian-American mafias working with Guyana-based Mexican criminals to traffic drugs to North America via Europe. The New Sococo Enterprise was found to be involved in the case, less than two years after a shipment sent by the company to Malaysia was found to have $7 million of liquid cocaine hidden inside. While two Sococo employees were charged in the wake of the 2012 case, Managing Director Manjula Brijmohan told Starbroek News that full inspections of her facilities by local law enforcement yielded no evidence and proper checks were carried out before any load was shipped out. Guyana's geographical location and financial instability make it an ideal base of operations for organized crime. Located in northeast South America, it sits across the Atlantic Ocean from key West African transit countries, as well as offering one of the shortest routes to Europe. In recent years, drug trafficking activity in the country has become notable -- the US State Department reported $42 million of cocaine was seized there in 2011. As the calls for international assistance in the current case suggest, the country is ill-equipped to face the growing organized crime challenge alone. According to the US State Department's 2013 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, the country has inadequate resources to maintain effective security, resulting in poorly monitored ports and porous land borders. While the report highlights a number of efforts by Guyanese authorities to tackle drug trafficking, it also notes a lack of arrests, and previous reports have underscored a lack of political will to target the challenge. Though Brijmohan's denial of culpability may seem an obvious response to the accusations, the common use of so-called ""gancho ciego"" (""rip on, rip off"") -- whereby containers are tampered with at sea or as they await export -- at ports elsewhere in the region makes it feasible the operation was the work of corrupt port officials or other elements from outside the company."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Okaida, Gang Inspired by Al-Qaeda, Expands in Northeast Brazil. Victory in a decade-long turf war fought in the northeastern Brazilian state of Paraiba has allowed Okaida, a local gang named after the Islamic terror group Al-Qaeda, to finally broaden its ambitions and muscle in on the neighboring state of Pernambuco. The gang is now believed to have as many as 6,000 members in Paraiba alone, mostly younger members attracted by Okaida's reputation on social media, according to a state government investigation. Created in the mid-2000s, Okaida did not originally make much noise outside its home state. It was mostly involved in a long and bloody turf war with rival gang, Estados Unidos (United States). Brazil's largest drug trafficking group, First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC), sided first with Okaida until a dispute in 2010. The PCC then allied with Estados Unidos. However, losing their ally does not appear to have hindered Okaida's growth. The group joined forces with Red Command (Comando Vermelho - CV) and Familia del Norte, to counterbalance aggressive PCC moves. Evidence of Okaida's arrival into Pernambuco came last year with the arrest of gang members in the city of Zona da Mata Norte. Almost 200 police officers and several helicopters took part in this raid, showing how seriously authorities responded to the group's spread. Several killings in the town of Camutangam, Pernambuco, were also attributed to the gang in 2018, with reports that they forced certain local residents out of their homes and took them over. But Okaida appear to be set to stay in Pernambuco. In early April, another gang member was caught in the state capital of Recife, involved in selling crack and carrying out robberies. Okaida and their rivals, Estados Unidos, drew their names from their very enmity. Okaida took their name from Osama Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist group, and Estados Unidos named themselves after the terrorists' enemy. But in a reversal of history, recent years have seen Okaida steadily gain the upper hand across Paraiba, taking territory in the regions of Mandacaru, Bola da Rede and Novais. State security officials say Okaida has gained more members than Estados Unidos, outmuscling their enemies on the street. In prisons, however, the factions often have their own separate prison wings and clashes have turned deadly. Okaida's recruitment strategy has largely depended on social media -- posting rap videos, pulling off PR stunts and showing off tattoos of Chucky, the killer doll. In October 2018, to celebrate its anniversary, Okaida orchestrated the simultaneous launching of big firework displays in six cities across Paraiba. One rap video, recorded by gang members in prison in 2017, rose to attention recently as news of Okaida's success began to spread. Although Okaida's 6,000 members seems small compared to the 30,000 or so members claimed nationwide by the PCC, their regional focus and ability to attract new bodies makes the gang a criminal force to be reckoned with in Brazil's northeast.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"In Colombia, Loan Sharking is Now Just a Click Away. The longtime loan sharking tactic in Colombia known as ""gota a gota"" has entered the digital age -- as mafias are now using mobile apps to hide money transfers, charge customers and threaten those who cannot pay. The ""gota a gota"" tactic, or ""drop by drop,"" -- named after the way in which victims are slowly bled dry of funds -- consists of lending small sums of money at high interest rates to people who have trouble obtaining traditional loans. The cash often comes from illegal activities, including drug trafficking. In the past, criminal groups have used store fronts to find customers and physical sheets to keep track of debts. But police say criminal groups have left behind this antiquated method in favor of mobile apps that make it much easier to reach and interact with their vulnerable clients, El Heraldo reported. Authorities have long fought traditional ""gota a gota"" operations, and the digitization of this extortion method complicates that task by providing debt collectors a new and easy way to access, charge and keep track of their victims. The applications record payment dates, new payments, interests, loan status and other details. In some cases, the applications even have access to debtors' profiles and location. Providing such information puts debtors in a dangerous situation as they are often threatened, robbed, attacked or even killed when they cannot pay. Meanwhile, authorities have found it difficult to combat the practice of ""gota a gota,"" because victims are often afraid to speak out. The ease of use of the new cellphone apps will provide new clients to mafias in the business of ""gota a gota"" loan sharking, which has proven to be particularly lucrative to criminal groups seeking ways to diversify revenue streams and launder money. While ""gota a gota"" started in Colombia, it has since migrated to a number of countries in the region - Mexico , Peru and Chile. Even Costa Rica , which has managed to avoid some of the ills of its Central American neighbors, has seen these loans take off because of an influx of cash from drug trafficking. What's more, cellphone technology has greatly expanded extortion rackets throughout Latin America. A cheap phone and a few dollars' worth of prepaid credit are the rudimentary tools to get in the game. The ""gota a gota"" method, however, usually requires the backing mafias, which have the capital to get in the loan sharking business and the ability to track the cash. And the apps are easy to come by. A search of app stores by InSight Crime found several of these apps available for free, some of which directly referred to ""gota a gota loans"" in their names. What makes the use of these apps alarming is the amount of information clients must provide, including detailed personal information. This simply makes it easier for debt collectors to threaten victims. Why send armed thugs to debtors' doorsteps when a simple WhatsApp message -- with their exact location or that of their loved ones -- will suffice?"	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Paraguay Contraband an Uncontainable Avalanche Spurred by Corruption. Official corruption is facilitating Paraguay's contraband trade, particularly near the Triple Frontier with Brazil and Argentina -- a hot spot for the illicit movement of products ranging from food to stolen cars and a center for money laundering. Paraguay's vice minister of industry, Pablo Cuevas, recently called the movement of contraband in Paraguay an ""uncontainable avalanche,"" and complained that the bodies responsible for addressing it were under-resourced. However, the business is also run with the complicity of tax and customs officials, who ensure that contraband shipments cross borders with no problems, according to ABC. In one recent case, evidence indicates customs officials allowed a truck loaded with 50 tons of sugar from Argentina to pass freely through controls on its way to Asuncion, and that police who later gave chase to the vehicle allowed those responsible for the shipment to escape, reported ABC. The Parana River -- which runs down from Brazil, along the eastern border with Paraguay and into Argentina -- is an important hub for the trade. Clandestine ports are located along it, while food products are also brought across the land bridge connecting Foz de Iguazu in Brazil with Ciudad del Este, Paraguay. Items from Argentina are carried up the Parana River to the Triple Frontier, as well as crossing the border at a port on the Paraguay River that connects to Asuncion, reported EFE. Paraguayan officials are also investigating 70 vehicles thought to have been stolen in Argentina and Brazil and trafficked into Paraguay. Meanwhile, Paraguay sends numerous clandestine shipments of electronics -- flown in from China -- and cigarettes by river into Brazil and Argentina. According to Paraguay's Ministry of Industry and Commerce , the country loses some $100 million each year to contraband. Ciudad del Este has long been a hub for contraband and counterfeit goods , as well as illegal drugs. The most recent reports underscore how this is facilitated by a culture of corruption , in a region where police have been accused of extortion, the navy of allowing clandestine ports to operate, and the region's judges of favoring drug traffickers. The local government is also under investigation for corruption. InSight Crime visited Ciudad del Este in August, and found that bargain products were traded mainly in dollars rather than the Paraguayan Guarani, indicating that the black market trade may be linked to money laundering. There are also economic factors that help spur the trade. ABC pointed to the inclusion of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay in the Mercosur trading bloc -- which promotes the free movement of goods and currency -- as a facilitator. Meanwhile, recent drops in the value of the Argentine peso compared to the Guarani have reportedly led to an increased flow of goods into Paraguay."	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
"Sao Paulos Overcrowded Prisons Stretched to the Breaking Point. On average, Sao Paulo's prisons operate with 70 percent more inmates than the system can support. Some prisons operate at triple their capacity. There are currently over 215,000 prisoners being housed in the state's 160 prisons that were constructed to hold 126,000. There are also 3,808 men and women being held in police stations and jails. Altogether, there are currently 218,983 prisoners in Sao Paulo. ""There's excessive delay in analyzing what prisoners are entitled to, especially in criminal cases,"" said Patrick Lemos Cacicedo, a coordinator from the Sao Paulo public defenders office, who specializes in prison affairs. ""Thanks to that, there are more prisoners entering the system than those being released. Building more prisons won't change the situation."" This article originally appeared in Ponte and was translated and reprinted with permission. See Portuguese original here. The provisional detention centers (Centros de Detencao Provisoria - CDPs), originally intended to house only those awaiting trial, are the worst prisons in Sao Paulo state. Ten of the 41 CDPs have an occupancy rate at over 200 percent -- three inmates for every one space. The Sao Bernardo do Campo center, in the greater Sao Paulo area, is the worst: although it has 844 spots, the CDP had as many as 2,749 inmates in early September (see chart below). This overcrowding forced Sao Paulo to open two new ""Carandiru"" prisons in the northern part of the state. Carandiru was once Latin America's largest prison, with 7,500 inmates, but the government shut it down in 2002, in part because of its violent history: in 1992, 111 inmates were killed in what is known as the Carandiru massacre. After the prison essentially imploded, then-Governor Geraldo Alckmin announced ""a shift in Brazil's penal system."" ""Let's start a new phase, with a more appropriate model of smaller prisons,"" the governor said at the time. One of the new ""Carandiru"" prisons is the Pinheiros penitentiary, located along a major highway within a district with the same name -- this is one of the main thoroughfares in western Sao Paulo. With 2,178 spots, the four CDPs that make up the Pinheiros penitentiary currently house 6,537 inmates, over three times its capacity. The other new ""Carandiru"" is in Hortolandia, some 109 kilometers from Sao Paulo in Greater Campinas. Also made up of four units, Hortolandia has 5,700 inmates in a space meant for 3,435. According to the Secretaria da Administracao Penitenciaria or SAP , one of Hortolandia's four units -- unit 3 -- has 700 spots but had no detainees until early September. Without the use of this unit, the rate of overcrowding in this new ""Carandiru"" is at 66 percent. Detainees in police stations and jails Documents on Sao Paulo's penal system, obtained by this reporter, show that 3,748 men and women were being held in police stations and jails as of July 28. Of these, 1,085 have been sentenced and should no longer be in these provisional units but in actual prisons. According to these documents, there are 4,485 spots available, but Sao Paulo's police stations and jails held 3,758 inmates at the end of July, 16 percent less than full capacity. However, in the metropolitan area, there were another 1,285 inmates in makeshift jails. In order to empty the jails and police holding cells -- allowing the police to devote more time to investigating crimes, which is their main job -- Sao Paulo would have to build four new prisons. Prison vs daycare costs If the government attempts to solve the problem of prison overcrowding, Sao Paulo would need to build 105 new penitentiaries. Each would need 847 spaces in order to house the 88,976 new inmates. But this would only work so long as the 160 prisons that already exist do not take in any new prisoners. If we count the four prisons needed to house those inmates who have been sentenced but remain in jails and police stations, overcrowding would only truly be solved if 109 new prisons were built. In an attempt to fix prison overcrowding, the state of Sao Paulo is currently building nine prisons (three for women and six for men) at a total cost of 319 million reais (about $132 million) in the hopes of creating space for 7,560 prisoners. On average, each space will cost 42,213 reais (over $17,500). ""If the prison population doesn't stop growing, where will the state be then?"" To get a sense of what these 42,213 reais represent, compare it to the 106.8 million reais (about $44 million) that the state government spent to create 8,000 spots for kids in nursery school programs. As of March of this year, nursery school vacancies for children up to six years old cost the state 13,350 reais (about $5,562) each, according to data from the state secretary of education. In sum, building a spot for a prisoner in Sao Paulo costs three times as much as opening a spot for a kid in the public nursery. In August, thanks to a decision by the state court of accounts (known as the Tribunal de Contas do Estado or TCE) the Sao Paolo government decided to cancel the bidding for the construction of another 12 CDPs in the state. The court rejected the calculations regarding how much the projects would cost, which the contractors said would cost 640 million reais (about $266 million) of public money. What are prisons for? Jacqueline Quaresemin -- a UNESCO consultant on education in prisons, and a professor of market intelligence and publicity at a school for sociology and politics in Sao Paulo ( FESPSP ) -- says people don't want to talk about prisons because they have a sense of security when the prisons are full. ""Society is left with the false idea that overcrowding equals safety,"" she said. ""They don't realize that ignoring such an important issue in a political campaign is something serious. It somehow legitimizes state policy -- both political and legal -- which condemns primarily the young, black and poor."" For Quaresemin, who is also an historian and sociologist, the root of the prison problem is lack of youth access to primary school education, and the lack of a serious rehabilitation policy. ""Maintaining overcrowded prisons is in whose interest? Society doesn't care,"" she explained. ""Someone is winning from it and understanding who is [winning] is important for the public because it is footing the bill. If the prison population doesn't stop growing, where will the state be then? Most inmates lack a basic education. And that's a mistake made by the state, as it creates a chain reaction. Prisoners need access to education. That's only way to see something other than being a criminal. As things work today, prison only enhances your dark side. We need to answer the question: what are our prisons for?"" ""Sao Paulo has no policy beyond the mass incarceration of especially the poorest sectors of the population."" Tadeu Deyvid Livrini, the coordinator for ministers who serve in the prisons, says building new facilities won't solve the problem. ""Overcrowding is the mother of all problems when it comes to the prison issue, but this is caused by a number of other problems,"" he explained. ""One is the courts, which take too long to issue sentences and also take too long to let inmates go, even when they have the right [to leave]. We need to analyze the issue of overcrowding as part of a series of problems."" 'Mass incarceration is the only policy' Patrick Cacicedo, a Sao Paulo public defender, believes the security policy of mass incarceration is one reason that problem has not been solved. ""Sao Paulo has no policy beyond the mass incarceration of especially the poorest sectors of the population,"" Cacicedo said. For Caicedo, those who enter and exit the Sao Paulo prison system are directly affected by the judiciary's action and inaction. ""Today, in Sao Paulo, the judges abuse pre-trial detention. When a person is poor -- even if he fulfills all the requirements that should allow him to walk -- the judges set a high bail and that means the person stays behind bars. What that means is he ended up in prison due to a lack of financial resources,"" he added. While these types of abuses send many pouring through prison doors, those expecting release are affected by the bureaucracy, which causes a major back-up of detainees. When analyzing the issue of detainees in police stations and jails, the public defender says this is an even more degrading situation than what he sees in the prisons. ""These are like storage units filled with human beings, almost always in the back of police stations and without any infrastructure. It is degrading,"" Cacicedo said. Sao Paulo says they are working on it When asked in early September about overcrowding in Sao Paulo's prisons and the cost of building nine new ones, the department of corrections did not respond to any of our 16 questions on the topic. This reporter also requested an interview with Minister of Prisons Lourival Gomes, but he did not respond. In a statement to us, Secretary of Public Security Fernando Grella Viera said: ""Since 2000, when the dismantling of jails was initiated, 236 units were deactivated in the state, including 38 dismantled during the current administration. This represents an approximate 70 percent reduction from a total of 348 establishments that previously existed. Another important fact is that today only 1.7 percent (3,808 prisoners) of the state's total prison population (220,100) is in jails. This percentage was 42.12 percent in 1994. Closing these jails and holding cells was only possible thanks to the expansion of the state prison system under the SAP."" *This article originally appeared in Ponte and was translated and reprinted with permission.

"Nats Catcher, Wilson Ramos, Kidnapped in Venezuela. Wilson Ramos, the catcher for Washington D.C. baseball team the Nationals, was abducted from his home in Santa Ines, in Venezuela's central Carabobo state. Ramos was in Venezuela to play for a winter league team during Major League Baseball's off-season. Reportedly picked up by a team of four armed men , he was presumably targeted because of the large ransom his kidnappers may extort in exchange for his return. On Thursday, Venezuela's police located the vehicle used in the abduction in a neighboring town. The Venezuelan government has promised to dedicate massive resources to resolving the case in a hurry. One official, quoted in an Associated Press story , says that the government ""is working 24 hours a day to solve this case."" Venezuela has one of the highest rates of kidnapping in the world. According to the Venezuela's National Statistics Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas - INE), there were up to 73 abductions reported every day during the period of July 2008 ? July 2009.

"Money Laundering Case against Haiti President-Elect Threatens Island Stability. An investigation into Haiti's President-elect Jovenel Moise for money laundering has begun just weeks before his inauguration, a case that could destabilize the country yet again. On January 20, Judge Bredy Fabien took his first steps towards investigating the money laundering allegations against the president-elect by calling the highest executives of the state-owned Banque Nationale de Credit (BNC) to testify about one of Moise's bank accounts, reported Le Nouvelliste. The judge's action was the first time authorities have publicly moved on the money laundering probe since an official judicial investigation was launched in September 2016. The BNC bank account stands at the heart of an administrative report from the Central Financial Intelligence Unit (Unite Centrale de Renseignements Financiers - UCREF), a semi-autonomous government institution that receives warnings from financial institutions of potential money laundering. The UCREF first began its administrative investigation in 2013, which eventually turned into last year's judicial investigation. However, the report -- which has been circulating online for months -- appears to be raw intelligence and analysis rather than part of a formal judicial inquiry, and, during a January 18 press conference, the head of the UCREF, Sonel Jean-Francois, emphasized that these were only partial findings. Nevertheless, the report contains some highly contentious details. It documents several large transactions deemed suspicious and that could not be justified as Haitian law required. These included what the document says was more than $5.5 million deposited on Moise's aforementioned account at the BNC. ""The observed deposits to this account are made in cash, and are substantial,"" the report says. ""We have observed several daily deposits concerning very significant amounts, which exceed the threshold requiring a 'declaration of the origins of funds.' We cannot justify the origins of these deposits as we do not yet possess supporting documents."" SEE ALSO : Coverage of Money Laundering In total, the probe is looking into 14 of Moise's and his wife's bank accounts that they held between 2007 and 2013. Other notable transactions and assets were documented, including 45 vehicles owned by the president-elect. ""In light of the aforementioned information, it is possible that Mr. Jovenel Moise handles funds that have nothing to do with his companies,"" the UCREF concluded, implying that the president-elect was laundering money. InSight Crime's attempts to reach the president-elect or his representatives to obtain comment were unsuccesful, but in previous statements to the press, President-elect Moise has vigorously denied the allegations and has noted that although this report should have been kept confidential, it was leaked to the public on August 23, 2016, the day his campaign was launched. The president-elect also said that he had ""hired lawyers to obtain the reparation of his reputation"" during an interview with Radio France Internationale , and decried the report as ""political persecution."" Moise, a businessman with no experience in politics or administration apart from a run as head of the Northwest Industrial Chamber of Commerce (Chambre de Commerce et de l'Industrie du Nord-Ouest), claims that the deposits to the BNC account at the heart of the allegations were made in Haitian gourdes and not in dollars, as the UCREF asserts. Between 2007 and 2013, a dollar was worth roughly between 35 and 40 Haitian gourdes. If made in Haitian currency, the cash deposits would have been closer to $150,000 and could have been under the legal threshold requiring justification. ""I'm an entrepreneur. I've worked in Haiti from 1996 up to today. I've had excellent relations with all the country's banks that have granted me loans,"" argued the president-elect in response to the allegations. UCREF's Jean-Francois said during a January 18 press conference that Moise's lawyers had sent the UCREF an alleged bank document showing the account to be in gourdes. But the official reasserted that his unit's findings were sound, based on the documents shared by the financial institutions and related to the 14 bank accounts. ""No mistakes were made in the report by the UCREF,"" he said, before adding that it was the bank's responsibility to transmit relevant documents that could clear up any mistake, and possibly as a way of shifting the responsibility of a potential error away from the unit to the state-owned bank. The head of the UCREF further argued that, ""Many focus on the dollar or gourdes account, but the investigation provides data, elements that sustain the report's conclusions,"" reported Le Nouvelliste. Jean-Francois added that it was currently the judiciary's responsibility to conduct a deeper investigation and administer subsequent proceedings if necessary. The investigation into the president-elect has clear and considerable political ramifications. Without strong regulatory and judicial institutions, its results may not satisfy anyone and could permanently damage Moise's legitimacy. This could further destabilize Haiti's political situation following a contested and delayed election. There are already growing signs of public frustration with the investigation as the inauguration day nears. In mid-January, four senators signed an open letter addressed to the Senate's new President Youri Latortue, two weeks after the official confirmation of the ballot results , asking that the investigation into the president-elect be wrapped up before inauguration day on February 7. On top of the senators' open letter, Haitian news outlets reported the launch of an international petition on January 23, asking parliament members to postpone the inauguration. And the Haitian Observatory for Human Rights called for the judiciary investigation to be ""reinitiated,"" according to AlterPresse. Haiti's Public Prosecutor Leger Danton told the Miami Herald that he hoped to receive Judge Bredy Fabien's conclusions before February 7. If Fabien confirms the UCREF's allegations, then Haiti may face yet another presidential vacuum. The country has repeatedly found itself without an elected leader , and 23 presidents have been overthrown since the island nation's independence. Even if Moise's name is cleared, many will still have doubts concerning a president who promised to tackle corruption during his campaign. Although the president-elect may have won 55 percent of the votes in November's election, this number corresponds to barely 600,000 votes in an nation populated by ten million inhabitants, noted The Guardian. In addition, the Miami Herald reported that the president-elect is under scrutiny for having allegedly obtained illegal loans from the state-owned commercial Haitian Popular Bank (Banque Populaire Haitienne). The case is also being administered by Judge Bredy Fabien. More broadly, Moise's case speaks to the lack of trust in the country's institutions and its politicians. The leakage of the UCREF's report, the slow-paced judiciary investigation and the outstanding uncertainties concerning the president-elect's BNC bank account are just the latest chapter. If the account was in gourdes, then documents may have been falsified by internal elements of either the BNC or the UCREF -- both of which are state institutions. And if the deposits were indeed made in dollars, then the president-elect still has a lot of explaining to do. SEE ALSO : Coverage of the Caribbean In addition, Moise's is but one case that is swirling around Haitian politicians. In January 2017, Haitian Senator-elect Guy Philippe was arrested and extradited to face drug trafficking charges in the United States. Philippe was the subject of a Haitian arrest warrant and had been on the US Drug Enforcement Administration's Most Wanted List following a 2005 US indictment. Yet he was allowed to run and win a senatorial race in 2016. A second senator elected in November 2016 is suspected of changing his name to hide a US conviction for human smuggling, according to the Miami Herald. And the new Senate President Latortue has faced allegations of criminal activities. In a US embassy cable from 2006 released by Wikileaks, then-Ambassador Janet Sanderson wrote that, ""Youri Latortue may well be the most brazenly corrupt of leading Haitian politicians."" The diplomatic cable goes on to note that Latortue had a powerful network, which included family members in high office and drug traffickers. Allegations of corruption have reached as high up as the presidential palace with at least two of Haiti's previous administrations. Opponents of former President Michel Martelly claimed the president was ""surrounded by a network of friends and aides who [had] been arrested on charges including rape, murder, drug trafficking and kidnapping,"" according to the New York Times. And former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide faced corruption charges in Haiti as well as drug trafficking allegations voiced by defendants in US courts."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Giulianis Broken Windows Wont Fix Central America. Rudy Giuliani -- the former New York City mayor touted as the mind behind a dramatic drop in crime in that city in the 1990s -- is offering some well-compensated advice to some of the poorest, most violent countries in Latin America, but his crime-reduction theories are based on a dubious concept and can be counterproductive. In October 2014, the former New York City mayor -- who had been hired by Guatemala's business community -- visited Guatemala to discuss the results of a four-month study by his security firm Giuliani Partners LLC on the country's security conditions. A few months later, a team from Giuliani's consulting firm visited El Salvador to help create an anti-crime strategy, reported Warscapes. Similar to Guatemala, Giuliani's firm had been hired by El Salvador's National Association of Private Enterprise (ANEP) to advise local leaders on how to combat violent crime. Giuliani will be returning to Central America this year to advise Honduras on how to manage insecurity and violence. Giuliani has also done consultancy work in Colombia and Brazil, where he traveled to Rio de Janeiro to help the city improve security in anticipation of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. The former mayor is uniformly received like a rock star, and his crime-fighting wisdom is treated as gospel, however shallow and rudimentary it is. ""For us the number one priority was security,"" Giuliani told the Guatemala crowd of his time as New York City mayor. ""When you have a tremendous amount of crime in your society, you are not going to solve it with schools, libraries, nice neighborhoods and sports teams. You have to emphasize law enforcement. As soon you get the crime down, the next thing you do is build up the social programs. That's when you create more jobs, better neighborhoods, better schools."" Giuliani left Guatemala with recommendations on how to better measure the effectiveness of its police and justice system, and thus determine how many police were needed and how high their salaries needed to be in order to cut back on corruption. In El Salvador, the president of the organization who invited him said he was confident the firm's proposals would ""break the circle of violence,"" and added that he hoped the government would give full consideration to Giuliani's formal recommendations, which are expected in early April. Central America needs help. The Northern Triangle region -- Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras -- is one of the most dangerous and violent regions in the world. In 2014, Guatemala's homicide rate stood at 31 per 100,000, while both El Salvador and Honduras had rates of over 60. Much of this violence is the result of widespread gang activity and drug trafficking through the area. Such levels of violence have taken a large financial toll on Latin American economies : violence in Honduras cost the country an estimated 19.2 percent of its GDP in 2013. Rampant insecurity is also seen as one of the primary factors motivating Central American youths to make the dangerous trek north to the United States. But there are numerous problems with the former mayor, beginning with his credentials. Statistics show violent crime and homicides started to drop prior to Giuliani's administration. Indeed, during the 1990s, crime did not only fall in NYC , but in major cities throughout the United States, including Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, and San Diego. Many observers also cite a complex mix of social and demographic changes for New York City's crime drop, namely: the end of the crack cocaine epidemic, an improving economy, and increased prison terms for criminals. All of this suggests Giuliani was less ""supercop"" and more the beneficiary of circumstance: he was simply in the right place at the right time. There are also major problems with Giuliani's core concept. Known popularly as ""broken windows,"" the theory -- first introduced by college professors George Kellog and James Wilson in 1982 -- suggests police can make areas safer by cracking down on minor ""quality-of-life"" offenses, like vandalism or panhandling, on the assumption that strict enforcement of the law against petty crime will prevent more serious crime from taking root. In addition to just how ridiculous this sounds in places with homicide rates six times what New York City had at its worst, there are serious doubts about the effectiveness of ""broken windows"" policies -- and concerns they have led to abuses by police in New York -- which should give Central American governments a degree of caution in adopting his recommendations. Randall Shelden , a criminologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said in an e-mail to InSight Crime that ""the so-called 'broken windows' idea is based upon a bad theory or no theory at all,"" and that ""hardly any credit should be given"" for Giuliani's ""broken windows"" approach. Robert Gangi -- a criminal justice and law enforcement expert who served as the Executive Director of the Correctional Association for over 29 years and founded the Police Reform Organizing Project (PROP) -- told InSight Crime that ""no credible research has proven that broken windows in New York City is an effective crime fighting strategy."" Instead, Gangi said a variety of factors were responsible for NYC's crime drop. In addition to reasons mentioned earlier, these include the stabilizing effect immigration had on poor neighborhoods, the eventual resolution of the drug war, and what he termed the ""little brother syndrome"" -- younger generations avoiding drug use after witnessing its ill effects. Gangi added that ""cities all over the world have seen a significant decline in crime, even those who did not employ a broken windows strategy."" The expectation, he said, that crime will drop by listening and employing Giuliani's approach is a ""theory built on sand."" Giuliani's policies can also be counterproductive. Gangi called ""broken windows"" policing in New York a ""blatantly racist form of law enforcement"" that has punished minorities for low-level offenses. The same has already happened in parts of Central America. Much of what Giuliani is recommending in Central America -- such as ""zero tolerance"" and his ""broken windows"" policies -- are what Central Americans called ""mano dura."" Enacted in the early 2000s to deal with the rise in street gang activity, mano dura involved large police sweeps in marginalized areas and the indiscriminate mass arrests of suspected gang members based on clothing and tattoos. These policies led to mass incarceration but have been ineffective at reducing crime and violence. Some studies even suggest they have actually worsened gang activity and InSight Crime has found they have helped the gangs reorganize, regroup, and recruit in the jails. In contrast to Giuliani, Gangi said there is a basic wisdom to apply in order to combat crime and violence that involves providing support and opportunity for people who, for one reason or another, have become marginalized. For these people, crime can become a way of life, or simply serve as a means to make a livelihood. This means governments should aim to provide job training, after school programs, improved education, and an end to aggressive and discriminatory policing. For his part, Shelden questioned how Giuliani would achieve this in Central America, since providing ""security"" -- which Giuliani explicitly stated during his visit to Guatemala City as his number one priority in New York City -- means ""doing little or nothing about the causes of crime."" While ""broken windows"" policing continues to have its defenders , Giuliani himself has somewhat retreated from the universal applicability of his policies, acknowledging that what worked in New York might not work in Guatemala. Indeed, the differences between New York under Giuliani and Central America today are vast: Giuliani's New York lacked the same crippling levels of poverty, extensive gang activity, and large-scale drug trafficking. Perhaps more importantly, however, the countries that make up the Northern Triangle collect hardly any tax revenue, meaning that funding for any of Giuliani's recommendations -- such as increased and better paid police -- will be hard to come by and the institutions one might use to apply justice are chronically impoverished. Central American government and business associations would do well to talk to others who have hired Giuliani before they proceed. In 2003, Giuliani presented a 146-point plan on reducing violent crime to government and business leaders in Mexico City. Then Mexico City police chief Marcel Ebrard said he would follow every one of the recommendations, yet the following year crime dropped by just one percent. This led many skeptical officials in Mexico City to criticize the work of Giuliani's firm, with new police chief Joel Ortega saying, ""I am no fan of Giuliani."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Former Colombian Police Director Joins Mexican Front-Runners Campaign. The likely winner of Mexico's upcoming presidential election has asked Colombia's former national police chief to assist him as an advisor, an apparent bid to boost the candidate's security credentials. On June 14 Oscar Naranjo, Colombia's recently-retired national police director, told reporters that the candidate in Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Enrique Pena Nieto, had contacted him and requested that he serve as a security consultant. Should Pena Nieto win next month's elections - and polls suggest that he will - Oscar Naranjo will be kept on as an advisor to the president. The announcement came just two days after the Colombian official formally stepped down from his position as head of the country's national police, ending a successful 36 year-long career. Naranjo is highly regarded for his success in cracking down on criminal activity and insecurity in Colombia. In addition to overseeing the capture or surrender of several top drug lords, he is credited with reducing homicides in the country. Naranjo's appointment allows Pena Nieto to strike back against his critics who (recalling the PRI's heavy-handed past) have speculated that he intends to make deals with drug traffickers. While he has not offered a significant alternative to the prevailing security strategy in the country, Pena Nieto has focused much of his security rhetoric on reducing violence rather than capturing and killing top drug bosses, leading some to question his commitment to the country's war on drugs. Because of Naranjo's high profile, the move was likely designed to portray the candidate as more ""tough"" on crime. However, it remains to be seen whether Naranjo will be able to live up to his legacy and contribute to a drop in violence in Mexico. It will not be easy, as the two have have very different security situations. Perhaps the most significant difference is the relationship of the conflict to physical control of land. Control of geographical territory is a key feature of Colombia's violence, whereas in Mexico the violence is centered more around key borderland hotspots. Ultimately, while Naranjo's relative success against criminal elements is encouraging, he cannot provide a blueprint for officials in Mexico to achieve the same results. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Transnational Sex Trafficking Rings Cash In on Venezuela Crisis. Authorities in Spain and Venezuela have arrested members of two different transnational networks sexually exploiting women and girls fleeing the South American country's political and economic crises. The sex trafficking rings dismantled by authorities in the respective countries this week both capitalized on the desperation of women and girls seeking job opportunities abroad by tricking the victims into situations of forced prostitution. Spanish law enforcement announced on June 27 that nine alleged members of a sex trafficking network based in the country's northwestern province of Salamanca had been arrested for their involvement in a group that trafficked Venezuelan women and forced them into prostitution under ""semi-slavery"" conditions. The alleged leader of this group was arrested in Venezuela on May 30 based on an effort coordinated through Interpol. According to Spanish authorities, who launched their investigation of the group in late 2017, the criminal network relied on its leader and members in Venezuela to deceive women into believing ""transporters"" would bring them to Spain for legitimate work opportunities. Once there, the women would be told they owed a debt that could only be paid off by prostituting themselves in nightclubs managed by the group. If they refused, the victims were threatened that the group's members in Venezuela would kill their relatives. The network used a string of heavily guarded nightclubs to generate profits from the forced prostitution, which where then laundered through at least eight companies the group owned. Thirteen victims were rescued and more than 2 million euros (almost $2.4 million) worth of properties, cash, jewelry and vehicles, as well as weapons, were seized as part of the operation. Meanwhile on June 23, police in the Venezuelan state of Tachira arrested six alleged members of a separate sex trafficking network believed to have lured adolescent girls with promises of employment in neighboring Colombia, only to funnel them into forced prostitution in Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil. According to Tachira Governor Laidy Gomez, victims of the sex trafficking network identified police and school officials as having facilitated the recruitment of girls aged 12 to 15, some of whom were smuggled across the Venezuela-Colombia border. The investigation was prompted by reports from parents in Tachira that their daughters had gone missing. However, authorities are expanding the scope of the investigation based on the fact that other victims have been trafficked by the network from elsewhere in Venezuela into the border state. Governor Gomez has requested assistance from authorities in the neighboring Colombian state of Norte de Santander to continue the investigation. The recent dismantling of two transnational sex trafficking rings preying on Venezuelan victims are a stark reminder of how the South American country's insecurity and spiraling crisis are creating lucrative opportunities for criminal groups to exploit desperate migrants. The criminal networks brought down in Spain and Venezuela are hardly the first to rely on a bait-and-switch model to recruit women from disadvantaged areas with false promises of work abroad, only to entrap them in situations of sexual servitude. Similar sex trafficking rings have been dismantled in recent years across Latin America, the Caribbean and Europe. For example, last month, authorities in the Dominican Republic rescued two dozen Venezuelan women who had been forced into prostitution there."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"As Uruguay Elections Near, Is Marijuana Law Under Threat?The two leading presidential candidates in Uruguay have expressed doubts about the country's landmark marijuana legalization law. Will the marijuana laws likely be scaled back, or is this simply politicking? On October 22, Luis Lacalle Pou, the presidential candidate for the National Party, reiterated that he would modify Uruguay's marijuana legislation if elected president in the October 26 elections, reported Infobae. Lacalle said that if elected, he would get rid of the provisions that allow the government to establish a regulated marijuana market; however, citizens would be able to continue growing marijuana for personal use and would be able to buy it in the so-called ""cannabis clubs."" Lacalle Pou's remarks came a week after ex-President Tabare Vazquez, the candidate for the ruling party, called the sale of marijuana in pharmacies ""unheard of,"" and indicated that he would be open to reforming the legislation. Vazquez has previously stated that he would use the country's registry of marijuana growers and consumers to offer them drug treatment. According to a poll published on October 8, Lacalle trails Vazquez by just one percentage point, indicating that a runoff election -- which would be held at the end of November -- is likely. While the candidates' statements may sound alarm bells for drug policy reform advocates, their rhetoric may have more to do with a desire to win over votes rather than an intention to significantly change the law. In a July survey, over 60 percent of respondents said they were opposed to the law legalizing marijuana, and criticizing the legislation may be a ploy to attract these voters. ""The remarks from both candidates is standard politicking ahead of the October 26 elections, and does not mean the law will be modified, much less repealed, any time soon,"" Open Society Institute researcher Geoffrey Ramsey told InSight Crime [ Ramsey is also a contributor to InSight Crime ]. Under the current legislation -- which has been championed by President Jose Mujica, who is ineligible to run for re-election -- companies compete to win government licenses to commercially grow marijuana for sale in pharmacies. In addition, the legislation calls for the creation of a government registry to track the number of individuals who cultivate the drug for personal consumption. According to Infobae, there are currently six hundred registered growers in the country. As the first of its kind , it is unsurprising that Uruguay's marijuana law has faced significant setbacks. The success -- or failure -- of the legislation is likely to play a significant role in regional drug policy reform, as other countries evaluate Uruguay's controversial experiment."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Mexico Destroys 92 Illegal Landing Strips So Far in 2013. Almost a hundred illegal landing strips have been destroyed in Mexico so far this year, a continuation of the significant downward trend over the last six years. Defense Ministry SEDENA announced that 92 landing strips had been decommissioned during the first six months of Enrique Pena Nieto's presidency, reported El Informador. Also dismantled were 60 laboratories for producing drugs. No details were given on the locations of the landing strips or the labs. The number of destroyed landing strips dropped by more than half between 2007 and 2012 -- from 880 to 344, according to SEDENA figures. However, the number of dismantled laboratories pointed to a different trend -- 2012 saw 236 dismantled, the highest number of any year since 2007. A total of 876 were destroyed between 2007 to 2012. The United States has given millions of dollars to Mexico to intercept drug flights under the Merida Initiative, and these efforts have had a major impact -- as reflected in the decreasing number of landing strips being discovered. While previously, drug shipments typically arrived directly to the Mexican border by plane from Colombia, they now mostly arrive overland through Guatemala (however, drug flights from South America remain common in some Central American countries, including Honduras ). Once drug shipments reach Mexico, they are much more likely to travel to the northern US border overland and by sea than plane, though some short flights are still used for the northward journey. The clampdown on narco-airstrips in Mexico has forced smugglers to adapt. Planes have been modified to be able to take off on very short runways, or land on rocky terrain. Meanwhile, ultralight aircraft, which are hard to detect and can use runways less than 100 feet long, are now being increasingly used for very short flights across the US-Mexico border. According to the US, in 2011 the number of ultralight drug flights detected in the border region had doubled in a year. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security announced a $100 million contract for a detection system targeting such aircraft.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"In Historic Action, Honduras Arrests Member of Prominent Drug Clan. Authorities in Honduras have captured the youngest brother from the vaunted Valle Valle drug trafficking clan, in an extensive operation that marks a significant turn in the battle against one of the largest criminal organizations in this country. Honduran special forces, dubbed the ""Tigres"" (Tigers), arrested Jose Inocente Valle Valle in a house in El Porvenir, in the Copan province, along with his wife, Marlen Griselda Amaya Argueta. Authorities also found a gold-plated AK-47 automatic rifle, various pistols, cash in three currencies and 10 passports, reported El Heraldo. Some of the passports were in the names of Jose Inocente's older brothers, Miguel Arnulfo and Luis Alonso, who are thought to command this family-based operation in western Honduras along with a third brother, Jose Reynerio. There was also identification belonging to Mario Urbina, the organization's accountant, reported La Prensa. In addition, authorities found a belt inlaid with 12 pieces of gold with the word ""Sinaloa"" emblazoned on them, El Heraldo reported. The Valle Valle clan is thought to work closely with Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. The Honduran government also announced it had recovered a photograph of Jose Inocente with Neptaly Alexander Aguilar Rivera, the head of the Transit Police in the state of Copan, where the Valle Valle clan bases its operations. Aguilar Rivera is also the former chief of police in El Paraiso, a municipality that serves as an important drug transit and operational hub for the Valle Valle clan. Officials said they were continuing to search for the two older brothers, although at least one of them is thought to have fled to Guatemala , where authorities are also said to be on high alert. The operation in which Jose Inocente was captured is targeting the entire Valles structure, including the group's front men and political contacts, according to police. US authorities have already requested the extradition of both Jose Inocente and his wife. The capture of a Valle Valle brother in Honduras is historic, representing the first arrest of a family member of this clan within the country. Over the last decade the family has surged to the forefront of drug trafficking operations in that country, aided by their strategic geographic position and their penchant for paying off officials. Aguilar Rivera is just the tip of the iceberg. Former El Paraiso Mayor Alexander Ardon is thought to have strong connections to the clan. According to La Tribuna , police believe he fled to South America when he got wind of the operation to be carried out against the Valles. Ardon reportedly has a long history of criminal activity that began with cattle trafficking. During his time as mayor, Honduran intelligence sources said he worked with the Sinaloa Cartel. In their coverage of Jose Inocente's capture, El Heraldo makes reference to security forces looking to dismantle the ""Cartel de Alex."" A reporter from El Heraldo told InSight Crime that police have just recently begun to use this term to describe the drug trafficking operation that Ardon is believed to lead. Ardon's brother, Hugo Ardon, used to run the government's Highway Fund (Fondo Vial), which was responsible for the building of major roads in the country. This latest move against the clan in Honduras is another strong sign that the Valles' high-level contacts may no longer be protecting them. It follows on a chain of actions against the group in both Honduras and the United States, which began with the July arrest of the Valles' sister, Digna , in Florida. She was accused of conspiring to illegally traffic cocaine to the United States along with her brothers. Then, in mid-August, Honduran authorities seized 52 of the Valles' properties in the Copan and Cortes provinces. On August 20, the US Treasury Department placed the Valles and its leadership -- Miguel Arnulfo, Jose Reynerio and Luis Alonso -- on its ""Kingpin List"" as significant foreign narcotics traffickers. The press release detailing the action called the group ""one of the most prolific Central American narcotics trafficking organizations"" and claimed that the organization was moving more than 10 tons of US-bound cocaine each month using a ""combination of brutal violence and public corruption."" The Treasury also blacklisted four businesses owned by the Valle Valle family for money laundering: three coffee producers and a cattle and milk company. While the capture of Jose Inocente is notable, he was not considered among the top leadership of the clan. It still remains to be seen whether authorities will do what it takes to reach the brains behind the Valle Valle operation."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Can Crocodile and Turtle Farms Reduce Mexicos Eco-Trafficking?Government-regulated crocodile and turtle farms have helped reduce illegal hunting and protect endangered species in Mexico, but the illicit trade continues. Illegally hunted and possibly illegally bred animals and their byproducts still circulate, and are also leaking out into the international market. The humble house in the rural village of Simon Sarlat in the tropical Mexican state of Tabasco has a sign hanging outside offering fish for sale. Inside, the front room is dark, the walls robin egg blue and dirty. In the corner sits a large freezer, full of frozen fish, but there are other goods available if the right questions are asked. After a query about turtles and crocodiles, a short, stocky fisherman with stubby, hard hands and weathered skin disappears into a side room. He emerges carrying a small plastic washbowl containing six live turtles of varying shapes and sizes. He offers all of them for 280 pesos -- around $15. The largest turtle is of the jicotea species. The rest are pochitoques. Both are some of the region's most trafficked. All are now officially protected species but Chico, the hunter, caught them in the wild. Chico also tells us that he can find us a crocodile. The raw skin will cost us a mere 400 pesos -- less than $20 -- even though it's some three full days and nights of arduous work for him in the nearby swamps of Centla, a protected biosphere that's home to the moreletii crocodile species, the primitive-looking pejelagarto fish, and a number of other plant and reptile species. *This article is the result of research on eco-trafficking in the region done in conjunction with American University's Center for Latin American and Latino Studies ( CLALS ). Tabasco accounts for a big chunk of the seizures of illegal turtle and crocodile products in Mexico. Data requested by InSight Crime showed that on a national level, the country's environmental protection agency PROFEPA (Procuraduria Federal de Proteccion al Ambiente) seized 12,081 turtles and 20,346 crocodiles between 2006 and 2015. Of those, around 20 percent of turtles and more than one-third of crocodiles were seized in Tabasco. The other seizures were in Mexico City and the state of Sinaloa. Humble fishermen like Chico struggle to feed their families by selling fish and rely on the modest income generated by hunting crocodiles and turtles clandestinely. But Chico's is a dying trade in Mexico. This is in part thanks to the prohibition of crocodile hunting in 1970, but more so the subsequent creation of a government-regulated farming system for turtles, crocodiles and other animals, known as Environmental Management Units (Unidades de Manejo Ambientales -- UMAs). The new farms established a legal framework for the breeding and commercial sale of animals that were particularly vulnerable to trafficking. Crocodile and turtle populations in Tabasco are still far from returning to past levels after being ravaged by hunting for decades, but they are recovering. The Gulf state has an important history and culture of turtle and crocodile hunting. The meats of both animals have long been consumed by local communities, who also believe that some of their by-products have curative properties. Crocodile fat, for example, is believed to be good for asthma when cooked with garlic and orange, placed in a freezer, and then heated up again later to eat. One bottle costs around 800 pesos (about $40). Hundreds of thousands of crocodiles were commercialized regularly in decades past, but only some 80,000 adult crocodiles roam the wild across Mexico today, according to Marco Antonio Lopez-Luna, a professor who specializes in crocodiles at the Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco (UJAT). The government farming system, prohibition and cultural shifts, including a declining demand for crocodile skin products, have all contributed to the break away from the illegal hunting of these animals as a way of life. Eloy Ramirez, who runs Mexico's first ever UMA in Buenavista nestled alongside the lush Pantanos de Centla biosphere reserve, said that these units have significantly brought down illegal hunting in the region. ""The crocodile skins we cultivate here are of the best quality,"" Ramirez told InSight Crime during an interview, where he showed off the wallets he produces, as well as a thick, cured skin of a six-foot crocodile. ""They're free of parasites and the process is much quicker [than on the black market]."" The UMAs have created standards and rules in a once-illegal industry, according to Ramirez, where regulated skins and meat reach higher prices and standards than what's available on the black market. Carlos Villar, the director of Pantanos de Centla at Mexico's Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales -- SEMARNAT), says the UMAs have been instrumental in conserving endangered species and protecting populations. ""The UMAs here in Mexico are very good, they require the same documentation as those in the United States,"" Villar said. ""Crocodile hunting today isn't organized crime. It's largely nothing more than locals selling to other locals."" But the number of illegal crocodile and turtle products seized in Tabasco over the last few years suggests that animals could also be leaking from the legal farms into the black market. It's hard to account for the thousands of products and animals seized over the years through illicit hunting alone. Although hunting continues, interviews and field research suggest that it is at a very low level compared to years past. In 2016, a PROFEPA inspection of an UMA run by Industria Moreleti -- one of the main international exporters of crocodile products in the region -- resulted in the seizure of more than 3,000 moreletii crocodiles. PROFEPA reported this was due to improper documentation, which could point to potential liberties being taken at these sites. Official production quotas could be exploited, feeding the illegal trade and helping explain the volume of seizures in recent years. And despite praise of the UMAs from academics, workers and government officials alike, there appears to be a disconnect between fishermen like Chico and the program's apparent success. Chico says he doesn't understand the point of the UMAs, that these programs don't buy from people like him and are robbing him of his livelihood. And he's not alone. Walking down the sidewalk in downtown Villahermosa through a stretch of small shops selling clothes, school supplies and other products, it wasn't hard to see that the illicit sale of crocodile skinned goods is still ongoing. A local salesman at one such shop selling crocodile belts, wallets, shoes and other goods, who wished to remain anonymous, told InSight Crime that the illicit industry is easy to enter. While the UMAs are required to provide a ""factura,"" or invoice, detailing the origins of the crocodiles they sell, this seller didn't have such documentation. He said that he buys his crocodile skins from many different sellers -- sometimes fisherman, sometimes UMAs -- but he never needs the legal paperwork.

"Colombia Investigation Reveals Workings of Wildlife Traffickers. Authorities in Colombia say they have dismantled the largest wildlife trafficking ring ever discovered in the country, lifting the veil on the shadowy networks behind a lucrative, but widely underreported transnational criminal activity. On July 7, Colombian police announced they had taken down a wildlife trafficking ring known as Los Pajareros (The Birders), which they accused of selling and distributing endangered wildlife across Colombia and internationally. In raids against the network, police arrested eight people and recovered 83 animals, among them parrots, turtles, flamingos, turkeys, toucans, gulls, storks, capybaras, canaries and parakeets. The arrests are the result of a yearlong investigation that began with a tip off that Heriberto Mateus, alias ""El Pajarero,"" was selling endangered species in a market in the city of Girardot, El Espectador reported. After putting Mateus under surveillance, police then traced his suppliers, the brothers Jairo and Jose Luis Algarra Gutierrez, who allegedly headed the gang. According to El Espectador, police believe vendors such as Mateus put in their specific requests with Jairo Gutierrez, who paid locals in rural areas between $10 and $17 to source the animals. The animals were then sedated and transported to farms or private houses that acted as distribution centers before being trafficked on to customers or sales points. The animals were kept at these wildlife warehouses in deplorable conditions, and subjected to cruel treatment such as birds having their feathers dyed to make them more attractive, the police stated. While many of the animals were then sold in Colombia, police say some were also moved on to Ecuador and Mexico. Police sources told El Espectador they believe the animals were trafficked internationally by sedating them and then concealing them on the person of ""mules"" or sending them directly to buyers by mail. Police estimate that 90 percent of the species trafficked by Los Pajareros were endangered and that their operations earned them between $27,000 and $48,000 a month. There are a variety of markets for illegally trafficked Colombian wildlife, both domestic and international. Within the country, there is large demand for turtles and iguanas, which are traditionally consumed over Lent. Internationally, Colombia has become a hub for illegally sourced reptile skins, with Colombian caimans sold on to be turned into clothing and accessories. However, seizures over the years suggest the largest markets, both domestically and internationally, are for birds, reptiles and fish that are sought after as exotic pets. Globally, wildlife trafficking is worth an estimated $19 billion a year, with 350 million plants and animals sold on the black market annually, according to the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. Aside from Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Bolivia and Brazil are also prominent sources of wildlife trafficked around the world, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) ( pdf ). Despite the huge sums of money on offer and the transnational nature of the crime, comparatively little is known about the criminal structures behind wildlife trafficking. And while Colombian police say that so far this year they have carried out 11,300 operations against wildlife trafficking, recovering 8,300 animals and arresting 1,553 people, these impressive sounding figures mask a broader failure to tackle these networks. The capture of Los Pajareros, therefore, is not only an unusually big win for the authorities, but it also offers a rare insight into the workings of these trafficking rings. The details revealed so far show how wildlife traffickers rely on residents in rural areas to source species. Such residents offer local expertise but their services come cheap and they may be unaware of the legal implications of capturing animals or the broader damage they are doing. The case also highlights the wide reach of traffickers' sale and distribution networks, which are essential for matching animals with buyers. According to the police, Los Pajareros maintained ""innumerous contacts"" in the urban centers of Bogota, Cucuta, Villavicencio and rural municipalities in the states of Cundinamarca and Tolima, as well as contacts abroad. In addition, the investigation illustrates the comparatively low tech smuggling techniques used, which rely on mules and standard postal services to transport sedated animals. While these methods have become steadily riskier over the years for drug traffickers, the comparative lack of awareness and resources to tackle wildlife trafficking mean they remain the easiest option for trafficking animals. Police sources talking to El Espectador admitted they were ill-equipped to detect animal trafficking in airports, although said they had begun training sniffer dogs for the purpose. Finally, the case highlights one of the main obstacles to tackling wildlife trafficking -- while the rewards are high the risks are low, even if you get caught. Sentences for wildlife trafficking range from four to nine years in Colombia. Under current sentencing guidelines, people convicted of sentences of five years or less are eligible for alternative penalties such as house arrest, meaning Los Pajareros may not even spend a day in prison, especially if they cut a deal and accept the charges against them."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Illegal Mining Behind Mercury Contamination Harming Colombias Indigenous. Mercury contamination caused by illegal mining in Colombia's Amazon is threatening the welfare of Indigenous communities who are now seeking legal action against the government. In November, a group of affected Indigenous communities presented a lawsuit against the government in a superior court in Bogota, claiming the violation of their constitutional rights, El Espectador reported. The communities say that the government has, either actively or by omission, permitted illegal gold mining and mercury dumping that has led to a humanitarian crisis affecting some 66 Indigenous communities. ""Although [the mercury contamination] is recognized by the state, it is negligently overlooked,"" the Amazon Indigenous Peoples Organization (Organizacion Nacional de los Pueblos Indigenas de la Amazonia Colombiana - OPIAC) stated. Mercury is frequently used by small-scale gold mining operations to extract gold from ore and to find small pieces of gold mixed in sediments. The chemical is toxic to humans and can have devastating effects on the environment. Reports of mercury contamination within the Caqueta river, as well as the Apaporis and Cotuhe waterways, have been seen since at least 2014. A study conducted by the national natural park service, the Ministry of the Environment and the Universidad de Cartagena recently identified an unusually high mercury content in 17 species of fish from the Caqueta river. Another report by government agencies and Corpoamazonia also found that the hair of inhabitants of the Caqueta, Apaporis and Cotuhe river basins exceed the mercury concentration threshold established by the World Health Organization (WHO). High levels of mercury have also been detected among children younger than two years old, indicating the consumption of breast milk with a high mercury content, according to Semana. An increase in children born with birth defects and illnesses has also been reported along the Caqueta river. Reported symptoms of mercury poisoning among these populations include increased heart rate, fatigue, weakness and decreased muscle strength. OPIAC claimed it is less about the government not having the economic resources to confront mercury contamination, but rather that it lacks the will to do so. ""The current administration does not have the will to respond to the situation of the Indigenous people, but it does show its interest in talking on international stages about protecting the Amazon and its inhabitants,"" said the Indigenous organization. The effects of mercury contamination on Indigenous groups in Colombia reflect a growing concern regarding the environmental devastation of illegal mining and other certain criminal economies, and the challenges governments face in combating it. In August 2019, the Colombian government re-signed the Minamata Convention , an international agreement to stop the production, importation and exportation of products containing mercury, with the goal of reducing domestic use of mercury by 180 tons per year and being mercury free by 2023. As around 55 percent of the mercury used in Colombia goes to gold mining, fulfilling that goal depends largely on the government's ability to control gold mining -- particularly illegal gold mining. While most large-scale regulated gold mining operations do not use mercury , it is common among small-scale and illegal operations that lack the capacity, funds and incentive to adopt cleaner and safer alternatives. Attempts to regulate mining-related mercury contamination in Colombia have been ineffective. In 2014, the Constitutional Court issued a judgment to protect Indigenous lands in the Sierra Nevada in Santa Marta by requiring reviews of mining permits. But the new regulation triggered a surge in illegal, unregulated mining operations. Two years later , in 2016, Indigenous groups in the Sierra Nevada filed a plea to extend the regulations to small-scale miners. To date, the judgment remains pending. The government's ability to protect the environment and vulnerable communities from organized criminal activities seems to lie not in environmental regulations, but on their ability to crackdown on criminal operations. The harmful effects of illegal mining-related mercury contamination are not only a concern in Colombia. Indigenous communities in Brazil and Peru are also denouncing the rising mercury levels caused by gold miners. In March 2019, authorities in Peru launched an operation to catch illegal gold miners and loggers that had cleared some 10,000 hectares of Amazon forest, leaving behind pools of mercury."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Perus Illegal Mining Hotspot Has Other Crimes to Worry About. Peruvian authorities dismantled a human trafficking network operating in the region of Madre de Dios, a territory known for illegal mining activity. The female trafficking victims were lured by promises of work, then exploited in night clubs in the cities of Lima, Callao, Madre de Dios, Trujillo, Huanuco and Ayacucho, the newspaper El Comercio reported. Authorities said a criminal organization called ""Los Brothers"" was behind the trafficking network, based in Madre de Dios. Fifteen people were arrested, including two officers with the Peruvian National Police (Policia Nacional del Peru - PNP). Among the arrested officers was Commander Manuel Morillo Cribilleros, chief of the Criminal Investigation Division (Division de Investigacion Criminal - DIVINCRI) in Puerto Maldonado, the region's capital. He was accused of providing information about police operations to the network. In March 2019, a massive operation was carried out to remove some 5,000 illegal gold miners from Madre de Dios -- a region of Amazon rainforest bordering Brazil and Bolivia. The intervention , however, revealed that the livelihoods of about 40,000 people were directly or indirectly dependent to illegal mining. The bust of the human trafficking ring shows just how deep corruption runs in Madre de Dios, where bars and night clubs have long catered to illegal miners. Sex trafficking has been rampant in this particular region. Recent busts include 44 victims rescued after the March mega operation against illegal mining. In 2017, authorities rescued six women and two underage girls forced into prostitution in the same region. In 2013, 300 women were rescued from a sex trafficking ring based in Madre de Dios. According to figures from Peru's National Institute of Statistics and Information (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica e Informatica - INEI), Madre de Dios ranked third in reports of human trafficking from 2011 to 2018. What's more, the latest bust revealed that the sex trafficking ring had operated since 2016 and received protection from a commander who was responsible for investigating the crime but was actually profiting from it."	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
"Southern Venezuela: A Gold Mine for Organized Crime. Drug trafficking, battles between state forces and armed groups, extortion and illegal gold mining have transformed southern Venezuela into a region where citizens live in a parallel state ruled by organized crime. Criminal gangs, members of Venezuela's Bolivarian National Guard (Guardia Nacional Bolivariana - GNB), Colombia's National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) and dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) are behind extortion rackets, contract killings, illegal gold mining and other illicit activities involving contraband and drug trafficking, according to a recent International Crisis Group report. These armed groups -- entrenched in Venezuela's border states of Amazonas and Bolivar -have stoked a climate of violence between rival criminal groups and civil society. The ELN continues to be the strongest criminal actor operating across 13 of Venezuela's 24 states, according to the report. In particular, the guerrillas earn some 60 percent of their illicit profits in southern Venezuela. Much of the profit comes from illegal mining, where the group controls an east-west corridor that runs across the main mineral regions. In the state of Bolivar, the ELN has seized a number of illegal gold mines from criminal gangs, known as sindicatos. While the ELN seems to be winning the battle there, the guerrillas have entered into a kind of alliance with the GNB and FARC dissidents to share illegal mining sites in neighboring Amazonas state. Groups of FARC dissidents are also financing at least 50 percent of their criminal activities through illegal mining. According to the report, the Acacio Medina Front -- reportedly led by Gener Garcia Molina Gener Garcia Molina, alias ""Jhon 40,"" and comprised of former members from nine FARC fronts -- controls some 40 dredging boats on the Rio Negro in southeastern Guainia department, which borders Venezuela. The dissidents tax miners on each boat 10 grams of gold per month, the market value of which is roughly $400, the report states. The report also highlights the well-known participation of members of Venezuela's military in illegal mining. These officials establish checkpoints in which they demand a percentage of the profits made by illegal miners, either in the form of gold, Colombian pesos or US dollars. In other cases, ELN guerrillas have had to bribe soldiers to be allowed to illegally extract gold, which has at times led to intense fighting among criminal groups. The conditions in Southern Venezuela have made it ripe for the presence of armed groups seeking to control illicit economies. From the border areas to the interior, the ""volatile and unpredictable"" loyalties of such groups put civil society in southern Venezuela at extreme risk, as citizens are caught in the middle of violent disputes, according to the International Crisis Group report. The report also warns of possible diplomatic confrontations stemming from the criminal actions of Colombia's ELN guerrillas. From their hideout in Venezuela, ELN guerrillas are able to continue attacks on authorities in different parts of Colombia. The report notes that these attacks could be interpreted as being coordinated and planned from Venezuela's capital Caracas. The ease with which the ELN moves across the Colombia-Venezuela border also allows them to traffic and launder illicit gold. These profits only further their criminal activities. The illegal mining, which requires the use of mercury, has also led to high levels of contamination in the Guainia, Inirida and Atabapo rivers. Mercury levels in these rivers are 60 times higher than the maximum amount the human body can handle, according to the report. International observers have also expressed concerns about criminal groups forcibly recruiting indigenous communities in the border region. All of these factors have created a perfect storm in which Southern Venezuela may well be South America's most vulnerable region to organized crime."	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
"Systemic Colombia Prison Corruption Reaches Top Officials. Two jail directors and 120 workers within Colombia's national prison system are accused of charging inmates for perks, including better housing, in a case that underscores the role jail authorities play in the vast corruption networks within Latin America's prisons. Last month, authorities arrested the jail directors at two Bogota prisons, La Picota and La Modelo, according to Cali's El Pais newspaper. Prosecutors say Luis Perdomo, La Picota's director, sought 30 million Colombian pesos (around $9,470) from prisoner and suspected drug lord Jose Bayron Piedrahita Ceballos. The payment was to allow family members to see Piedrahita before his pending extradition to the United States to face racketeering and corruption charges. Authorities arrested the jail director on January 27 at a meeting with Piedrahita's son, El Espectador reported. Perdomo has denied the charges. Three days later, Cesar Ceballos, the director of the La Modelo prison, was arrested on corruption and illicit enrichment charges. Prosecutors say he asked for cash payments from inmates and their family members for better housing assignments. Medical appointments, illegal drugs, alcohol and even guns could be had for a price, El Tiempo reported. Ceballos has denied the charges. In the last two years, some 120 people working for Colombia's National Prison Institute (Instituto Nacional Penitenciario y Carcelario - INPEC) have been arrested for bribery and extortion, according to an El Tiempo investigation published in the wake of the jail directors' arrests. The massive bribery scheme involving two of Colombia's top prison officials underscores how Latin America's prisons help spawn and reinforce organized crime structures. Prisons throughout the region are old, neglected and overcrowded. In some countries, deplorable conditions and underfunding have led authorities to largely surrender control to the inmates themselves. In the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, gangs run cell blocks or even entire jails. For example, in El Salvador, imprisoned Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Barrio 18 gang leaders use the country's prisons like their headquarters , directing extortion rings on the outside. In the case of Brazil's First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC) prison gang, members must pay dues to pay for lawyers and for protection from abuse by guards. Mafias known as ""pranes"" have set up an extortion system in Venezuela's prisons, where inmates who want to have visitors must pay. Colombia's prison system, while safer and better organized than most in the region, is nonetheless severely overcrowded and lacking oversight. This has long allowed for what are called ""caciques"" -- usually cartel kingpins, guerrilla commanders or paramilitary leaders -- to control certain spaces, or ""patios,"" within the prison, and to tax contraband such as cell phones, drugs and liquor. In this bribery scandal involving the national prison system, however, the guards and directors themselves became caciques. They handed out the perks, controlled the prices of contraband, and most importantly, held the keys to patio assignments and visitations. Several inmates described in detail the black market that flourished within Colombia's prisons. A prisoner at a jail in Barranquilla said that inmates paid for bags of rice, televisions and air conditioners. Inmates at Bellavista prison outside of Medellin were charged by jail authorities to be placed in study programs or on jobs that reduced prison time. At the Picota prison, inmates paid monthly rents of 3 million Colombian pesos (around $1,000) to be housed in more comfortable cell blocks. A guard also told El Tiempo that he had been threatened for revealing corruption within the prisons and that colleagues had been killed for similar whistleblowing attempts. Audio recordings revealed in a court hearing show just how systematic the bribery was within Bogota's Modelo jail. While speaking with a female relative of a prisoner, a subject in one recording tells her that to move prisoners to a better patio required a payment of 20 million Colombian pesos (around $6,500 to the director. ""You are not the only one paying,"" he tells her."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Gas Smugglers Busted as Colombia-Venezuela Contraband in Flux. Authorities in Colombia have dismantled what they claim to be the biggest gasoline smuggling network operating along the Venezuela border, a blow against smuggling that comes at a time when the reopening of the border is set to change the contraband dynamic in the region. On August 13, Colombian police announced the arrest of 28 alleged members of a smuggling network known as ""Los Coyotes"" in 25 raids in cities across northeast Colombia. According to the police, the gang sourced cheap Venezuela gasoline from around the state of Maracaibo then smuggled it into Colombia in what are dubbed ""caravans of death"" -- convoys of vehicles loaded with illegal gasoline that move at top speed along clandestine border crossings and rural roads. In Colombia, the network allegedly used the city of Maicao as a collection and storage point, then distributed the gasoline further to the south in municipalities of Cesar department. The blow against the smuggling network follows news that Colombia and Venezuela have reopened the border between the two countries, which had been officially closed for nearly a year. The plan announced by the two governments is for a gradual normalizing of border controls, beginning with the opening up of several pedestrian border crossings for 12 hours a day, reported the BBC. Smuggling Venezuela's dirt cheap subsidized gasoline is the mainstay of a contraband trade that is changing rapidly in the Colombia-Venezuela border region. While gasoline remains widely available, Venezuela's economic troubles have created severe shortages for the other subsidized and price-controlled goods that were previously smuggled into Colombia. This has not only reduced the flow of goods into Colombia but in some cases even reversed it, with goods smuggled into Venezuela from Colombia for those who can pay the higher prices. The decision to reopen the border will facilitate the legal movement of goods to make up for shortages in Venezuela. It also will likely be a blow to organized crime networks, which profited greatly from the Venezuelan government's unilateral decision to close the border in August 2015 following an attack on Venezuelan security forces it blamed on Colombian paramilitaries. The move essentially shut down small scale ""smurfing"" contraband operations -- individuals making multiple cross-border trips with small quantities of merchandise -- which accounted for the bulk of smuggling in the region. However, the lack of smurfs only fueled the larger contraband operations that smuggle bulk quantities along hidden border crossings away from urban centers. For organized crime and insurgent networks, this represented an ever more lucrative source of income , as the more far-flung crossings traverse their territories, allowing them to charge smugglers a toll for their use. As the border opens up, there is likely to be a shift back towards smurfing operations -- at least for the goods that are still available to be smuggled."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Bolivia Destroys 71 Tons of Contraband Cigarettes. Bolivia began the destruction of 71 tons of contraband cigarettes, the largest such operation in the country's history. On August 24, Bolivia's La Jornada reported that customs officials in Santa Cruz had begun the monumental task of destroying some 2.4 million cigarette packs illegally smuggled into the country. In total, an official said the load amounts to 71.1 tons of cigarettes that could have been sold on the black market for $347,000. The contraband cigarettes reportedly originated in Paraguay, and were seized in two large-scale operations launched in June. Because of the sheer number of cigarettes involved, authorities believe destroying them all will take at least a week and a half. Despite these successful operations, the Bolivia-Paraguay border remains largely unmonitored, and contraband smugglers generally cross with ease. As InSight Crime has pointed out , the eastern Santa Cruz department is a hotbed for organized crime and smuggling operations stretching into Paraguay and Brazil, largely conducted via small aircraft. A main contributor to this trend is the rampant corruption among Bolivian customs officials. To combat this, in June Customs Director Marlene Ardaya announced that all customs agents would have to carry special monitoring devices on them during work hours. While they function as pens, they are also equipped with small cameras and audio recorders, and random checks of employees' monitoring devices would be conducted periodically. While the sale of contraband seems like a lesser crime compared to cocaine trafficking, it is not so far removed from it. Contraband is actually quite commonly used by criminal structures to launder profits from other criminal activities. The lack of recorded transactions provides groups with an easy way to invest the bulk cash associated with drug profits, and allows them to diversify their income as well.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Brazil Security Surge Tries to Plug Leaks in Amazon Border. Brazil has deployed 8,700 troops to the northern Amazon frontier, its fourth ambitious border crackdown in less than a year. But questions remain about Brazil's ability to sufficiently plug the holes along its vast border, shared with 10 countries. The border security operation , code-named ""Agata 4,"" will employ 8,700 troops from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, supported by 11 boats, nine helicopters, and 27 airplanes. The troops will patrol 5,500 kilometers of a remote stretch of border (see map below) shared with Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana, between the mouth of the Oiapoque river and the municipality of Cucui, Amazonas state. The operation is designed to stem the trafficking of drugs, contraband, and humans through aerial surveillance and ground patrols. Another priority is the destruction of illegal mines and airstrips. The military side of the operation is reportedly intended to last no more than a month before giving way to a longer term law enforcement presence. Brazil's military conducted three other border operations, also codenamed ""Agata,"" in 2011, targeting the midwestern and southern frontier. Two additional similar operations are planned for 2012. The military argues that these security surges are already reducing the availability of narcotics in certain border regions. According to BBC Brazil , the last operation, Agata 3, resulted in a 60 percent rise in the price of cocaine paste in the city of Carceres and a doubling of the price in Cuiaba, both in Mato Grosso state. The Agata security surges are central to President Dilma Rousseff's $6.3 billion border security strategy , an effort to stifle the flow of illicit goods across the country's 17,000 kilometer border. While the crackdown has shown some results , mostly in terms of confiscated weapons, drug seizures, and arrests, there are concerns about the border plan's long-term impact. According to the BBC, traffickers are known to prepare large shipments of drugs or contraband in anticipation of the military's withdrawal, in order to compensate for the slow business during the security surge. In order to better ensure the permanent dismantling of these trafficking networks, the Ministry of Justice will reportedly oversee a more long-term deployment of law enforcement and intelligence officials to the Amazon, following the withdrawal of military troops, in an operation dubbed ""Sentinel."" In addition to the question of the border plan's long-term impact, the other key challenge facing Brazil's border security strategy is the scope it requires. The number of vunerable trafficking points -- the Amazonian north, the west, the south -- explains why the four ""Agata"" operations have taken place in so many different regions, rathern than focusing on a single area. Brazil is seeking to secure a border shared with 10 countries, including the world's three biggest cocaine producers (Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia), to say nothing of its 7,500 km coastline, which has made the country a prize for drug traffickers seeking access to markets in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. In additon to being a key transit point for drugs headed east, Brazil has become the continent's largest import market for drugs. Both factors contribute to significant pressure on Brazil's border authorities. Brazil may not be able to properly secure its border without some cooperation from its neighbors, as demonstrated by the wave of security partnerships recently brokered with its neighbors, including Bolivia , Venezuela , and Colombia (an agreement with Peru is also being considered). But in terms of military and economic resources, few of these partnerships are on equal footing, and Brazil may have a difficult time reducing the flow of illicit goods into its borders if its neighbors don't step up. This is particularly a problem along Brazil's northern border, where Operation Agata 4 is being carried out: the Amazon is dense and difficult to patrol, and much of it is shared with Guiana and Suriname, both particularly small, poor, and limited in their capacity to combat the flow of illicit goods.

"Brazil Arrests Smugglers after Ramming Plane to Stop Escape. Brazil's Federal Police arrested a group allegedly trying to smuggle electronic equipment from Paraguay into northern Sao Paulo state, driving a police car into the wing of the suspects' plane to stop it taking off. Police seized the plane, which was filled with contraband electronics, and arrested five individuals, including the pilot. Over the past five years, authorities have seized 11 other aircraft suspected of carrying illegal goods in Ribeirao Preto, which lies in Sao Paolo state. The operation was recorded on video from the police vehicle. As the smugglers became aware that Federal Police were in pursuit, they attempted to flee in the plane. However, the police car smashed into the wing of the aircraft, preventing them from taking off. Four passengers, as well as the pilot, were taken into custody. Federal Police investigations into the so-called "" hillbilly route ,"" which uses a sugarcane plantation as an off-loading point for smuggled goods, have been underway for a month. The contraband, which included 114 laptops, is valued at $200,000 dollars and suspected to have originated in Paraguay. Drug and contraband smugglers have been targeted by authorities in Brazil and Paraguay under a bilateral security agreement established in June of this year. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexican Cartels in Colombia: Setting Up Shop or Seeking New Partners?Colombian authorities have claimed that Mexican cartels are attempting to establish themselves in the South American country. However, the presence of suspected cartel members in Colombia is more likely an indication that Mexican organized crime groups are seeking new partners to fill the vacuum created by FARC's demobilization and the Urabenos' decline, two of their closest allies. Citing Colombia's Attorney General's Office, the counternarcotics police, and the Ombudsman's Office, El Tiempo reported that Mexican organized crime groups have established a presence in the Colombian departments of Antioquia, Cundinamarca, Norte de Santander, Valle del Cauca, Narino, Meta, Guaviare, Vichada y Cordoba. According to an intelligence report by Colombia's Anti-narcotics Police, Mexican cartels including the Sinaloa Cartel, the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion - CJNG), and the Zetas are attempting to take control of the drug trade after their Colombian partners ""failed to meet quotas for Colombian coca,"" El Tiempo reported. This failure to meet quotas, the report claims, was the result of FARC's demobilization and the weakening of the Urabenos. The report added that Mexican cartels are sending their members to the regions with the highest concentration of coca crops as well as to strategic ports within Colombia. According to El Tiempo, authorities have detected groups of as many as 10 Mexicans coordinating drug shipments from the Gulf of Uraba. Furthermore, in the beginning of 2017, Colombian authorities investigated 103 Mexicans involved in drug trafficking cases, according to statements made by the Colombian Attorney General, Nester Humberto Martinez, and published by El Tiempo. El Tiempo's report does not include figures from previous years to allow for comparison. The presence of suspected members of Mexican organized crime groups in Colombia should not be understood as an indication that Mexican cartels are attempting to seize control of the country's drug trade. Although it might be in the groups' best interests to create more vertical distribution chains, entering into a criminal landscape as complex as Colombia's would present enormous challenges. Since Mexican cartels' current business model has worked relatively well to date, these challenges would likely outweigh the potential benefits. Therefore, the growing presence of Mexican organized crime groups in Colombia should be considered within the context of the South American country's changing criminal landscape. The FARC, once Mexican cartels' principal partner in the region, have demobilized, and the Urabenos, who succeeded the FARC in that role, have been severely weakened by a sustained government offensive. As a result, Mexican cartels have been forced to seek new allies to ensure that the drug trade continues to flow smoothly. For years, Mexican organized crime groups have regularly sent emissaries to Colombia to scout new partners , supervise drug production, and ensure quality control. It is not a coincidence that Colombian authorities have recently detected a Mexican presence in regions that were formerly controlled by the FARC and the Urabenos. Narino, for example, a department that produces more coca than Bolivia or Peru , used to be a FARC stronghold. Following FARC's demobilization, dissident elements of the guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN), and hybrid groups called ""bandas criminals"" (BACRIM), or criminal bands, began to operate in the region. Similarly, the historically FARC controlled departments of Guaviare and Meta now serve as the base for the First Front of the FARC dissidence. It therefore makes sense that Mexican organized crime groups would seek to forge alliances with these actors in order to guarantee the continued flow of narcotics. Another example is the department of Cordoba which was historically the territory of the paramilitary groups that gave rise to the Urabenos. With the Urabenos facing threats from new criminal groups , it is likely that the Mexicans have begun looking for new alliances in this region as well. On the other hand, the face of drug trafficking in Colombia is changing. The time when a single cartel controlled the entire supply chain has come to an end, and now smaller groups control each separate link of the production and trafficking chain. Mexican cartels must now subcontract to different organizations in order to move their product from its origin to its destination, and must have an understanding of the dynamics between these organizations. *With additional reporting by Sergio Saffon."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Maritime Seizures of LatAm Cocaine Shipments to Spain on the Rise. Authorities in Spain say they have seen a marked increase in maritime seizures of South American cocaine destined for Europe in the past two years, highlighting the importance of this simple but efficient drug trafficking method. Spanish authorities told El Confidencial that maritime drug shipments ""have multiplied considerably"" in the last two years, with most coming from Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil and the Caribbean. Indeed, in just the past two months, the anti-drug and organized crime unit of Spain's police, in partnership with other anti-narcotic agencies, has seized nearly nine metric tons of Spain-bound cocaine. The amount was collected during three separate operations. The first took place on May 4 and led to the seizure of approximately 2.4 tons of cocaine in the Atlantic Ocean aboard a Venezuelan fishing boat. The second -- and largest -- took place on May 15, when over 5.5 tons of cocaine were seized aboard a cargo ship in Ecuador's national waters. According to Spanish authorities, who coordinated the operation with Ecuador's police, the ship was due to cross the Panama Canal before heading to Spain. The latest incident took place on June 4, when 1.2 tons of cocaine were seized aboard another Spain-bound Venezuelan ship sailing on the Atlantic. Spain's Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido stated that the recent seizures ""show that the fight against drug trafficking and the international organizations that bring drugs from Latin America to Spain is yielding results."" ""We shall not stop until we dismantle all groups trying to smuggle narcotics into Spain,"" he added. The recent multi-ton Spain-bound cocaine seizures serve as a reminder of the importance of maritime smuggling for drug traffickers. This is particularly true in the case of cocaine; Ana Lilia Perez, author of the book ""Seas of Cocaine,"" estimates that some 70 to 80 percent of cocaine consumed globally is at some point trafficked by boat. According to the US State Department's 2017 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, booming cocaine production in the Andean region has led to an increase in the amount of cocaine flowing globally, and a parallel growth in the amount of narcotics being smuggled via both the Atlantic as well as the Pacific. As InSight Crime has previously noted , drug trafficking organizations in Colombia -- the world's biggest producer of cocaine -- appear to have increased their smuggling operations via the Pacific as a result of crackdowns on drug vessels leaving through the Caribbean. Indeed, the percentage of cocaine seized in Colombia's Pacific departments reached 44 percent in 2016, compared to 21 percent in 2014. Still, the Atlantic is a more efficient route for shipments to Europe, and the recent seizures by Spanish authorities underscore the importance of not only Colombia, but also Venezuela and the Caribbean as crucial transit zones. However, it is Brazil that is the principal departure point for the bulk of South American cocaine destined to European, African and Asian markets. According to some estimates, the port of Santos in the state of Sao Paulo is the departure point for as much as 80 percent of the cocaine that reaches Europe."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Sinaloa Cartel Expands Reach in Peru, Australia. The Sinaloa Cartel reportedly maintains two armed cells at the border between Ecuador and Peru, according to a district attorney general's office. Another report by Australian press highlights the cartel's increased presence in major cities like Sydney and Melbourne. These accounts are another reminder of the Sinaloa Cartel's increasingly global reach, as the organization looks to reach new markets and ensure access to drug crops. According to La Republica , the Sinaloa Cartel's Peruvian operations are directed from Guayaquil and Cariamanga in Ecuador. The region's mid-level bosses are Colombians, and command two cells consisting of 40 to 60 people in the mountainous Ayabaca province, which straddles Ecuador and the Pacific ocean. One cell takes care of buying and processing coca at the border, and the second cell monitors the shipment of product from Peru onwards to the U.S. or Europe. The cartel's operatives are reportedly well-equipped with M-16 and Galil rifles, grenade launchers, hand grenades and satellite equipment. The newspaper adds that the Sinaloan operatives are believed to buy regular favors from local police and government officials. One lawmaker is believed to have tipped off the group after November 12, when police found a mega-laboratory for processing cocaine in rural Ayabaca. The lawmaker, Miguel Silva Burgos, allegedly received $5,000 a month for keeping the traffickers informed of police actions. The Sinaloan traffickers regularly move across the border between Peru and Ecuador, avoiding arrest, La Republica reports. The Sydney Morning Herald, meanwhile, has published a report about the Sinaloa Cartel's incursion into Australia, again demonstrating the cartel's growing sphere of influence. In September 2010, the newspaper reported that the Sinaloa Cartel was smuggling about 500 kilos of cocaine into Australia every month. The street price of cocaine in Australia is two to three times higher than the U.S. or Europe, the newspaper notes, creating an especially profitable market. Australia saw one of its biggest drug busts ever in June 2010, after police seized a 240 kilogram shipment of cocaine, believed to belong to the Sinaloans. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
El Salvador Accuses Ambassador of Arms Trafficking. Prosecutors in El Salvador have asked Congress to strip the country's ambassador to Germany and former Defense minister of immunity so they can pursue charges against him related to an alleged arms trafficking ring. The Attorney General's Office is accusing Gen. Jose Atilio Benitez of fraud, illegal possession of weapons, and illegal arms trafficking, La Prensa Grafica reported. The prosecutors alleged that Benitez ordered subordinates to fraudulently register firearms, allowing for their subsequent illegal sale. Attorney General Douglas Melendez filed the petition with the Legislative Assembly on June 2, alleging that Benitez was at the head of an arms trafficking ring. State prosecutors said the ring involved current and former officials essentially transforming a military logistics office into a gun shop. Investigations of Gen. Benitez have reportedly been ongoing since 2014. Prosecutors raided Benitez's home in July of that year, finding the registrations for 29 firearms that were supposed to have been destroyed. The general was serving as ambassador to Spain at the time. A simple majority of Chamber of Deputies is needed to remove Benitez's constitutional immunity. Prosecutor Rodolfo Delgado said the investigation has found no connection between the arms trafficking ring and organized crime, the Prensa Grafica reported. This is not the first time that higher ups in El Salvador's military have been accused of trafficking arms. In September of 2015, a retired colonel was arrested for weapons possession and trafficking. Military officials have traditionally experienced a high level of impunity when it comes to these types of crimes. While no links have yet been established between Gen. Benitez's alleged arms dealing and organized crime groups, active duty and retired military officials have sold weapons to transnational criminal groups in the past, including Los Zetas in Mexico and both the MS13 and Barrio 18 in El Salvador. Arms trafficking at the upper echelons of government can undermine the state's legitimacy and its efforts to crack down on organized crime. 	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
Officials: California an Ammo Pipeline to Mexican Drug Cartels. The amount of ammunition that Mexican police have seized in Tijuana has more than doubled since 2008, an official testified during a California Senate hearing. The Los Angeles hearing was meant to address firearms trafficking between California and Mexico. According to the city's police liaison with Tijuana, Alejandro Lares Valladares, Tijuana is now seizing significantly larger shipments of smuggled ammo. Authorities have seized over 11,000 bullets so far this year, compared with just 4,312 in 2008. Lares did not specify how much of this ammo has been successfully traced to the U.S. The amount of bullets seized in Tijuana suggests police may have improved their ability to track arms shipments. But it also indicates that alongside other southwest states, California may be becoming an increasingly important source of ammunition for Mexican gangs. In Arizona, authorities have reportedly seized over 95,000 rounds of ammo so far this year along the state's border, a 125 percent increase from 2007. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Hezbollah Laundering Money for Colombia Cartel: DEA. The DEA has revealed money laundering links between the Lebanese terrorist organization Hezbollah and Colombian mafia group the Oficina de Envigado. However, any assertions of a mass-scale narco-terrorism nexus should be taken with a pinch of salt. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has claimed that the Hezbollah's global drug trafficking network, known as the External Security Organization Business Affairs Component (BAC), has ""established business relationships with South American drug cartels, such as the Oficina de Envigado."" The assertion was made in a press release describing the arrest of various members of the BAC -- responsible for transnational criminal activities such as drug trafficking and the laundering of drug proceeds. The dirty money is reportedly used to buy weapons for use in the Hezbollah's activities in Syria. The Colombia-Hezbollah laundering system reportedly begins in Europe, from where millions of euros worth of profits from drug sales are transported to the Middle East, via an intricate network of money couriers. The funds are then sent back to drug traffickers in Colombia through Hawala -- an informal distribution system that uses brokers to transfer money and currency. A large amount of these proceeds reportedly transit through Lebanon, and a ""significant percentage"" remains in Hezbollah coffers. These revelations come as part of an investigation into the Lebanese Canadian Bank. ""These drug trafficking and money laundering schemes utilized by the Business Affairs Component provide a revenue and weapons stream for an international terrorist organization responsible for devastating terror attacks around the world,"" DEA Acting Deputy Administrator Jack Riley said in the press release. Links between drug trafficking and terrorist organizations is a reality in Latin America. However, assertions of wider narco-terrorism conspiracies should be approached with caution. The DEA has been criticized for inducing individuals to commit so-called narco-terrorist acts with the aim of ""exposing"" how drug trafficking directly funds terrorist activities. These operations against narco-terrorism are arguably a convenient way for the DEA to tap into more government funding -- a large amount of which has been redirected from drug enforcement to terrorism following the 9/11 attacks in the United States. In many situations, undercover DEA agents set up scenarios that could arguably be considered entrapment in order to catch culprits red-handed. These set-ups often constitute the only tangible evidence of ""narco-terrorism"" when it comes to prosecuting the case. That said, there is significant evidence that Hezbollah has indeed collaborated with criminal groups in Latin America, although links to established drug trafficking organizations have not been so evident. The United States has previously blacklisted Venezuelan and Colombian nationals for laundering money for the terrorist groups, and in 2014, it was reported that Lebanese traffickers were helping the Brazilian prison gang the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital -PCC) to access weapons. If the allegations of links with Colombia's Oficina de Envigado crime syndicate are true, this could be one of the more convincing arguments that the Lebanese terrorist group has active links with drug trafficking networks in Latin America."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"US Treasury Keeps Pressure on Reeling Zetas Leadership. The US Treasury has added two alleged Zetas financial operatives to its Kingpin List as it ratchets up the pressure on Mexico's most feared organized crime group following the arrest of its maximum leader, Miguel Angel Trevino, alias ""Z40."" The Treasury sanctioned Jose Odilon Ramirez Perales, who allegedly laundered tens of millions of dollars of drug trade profits smuggled from the United States to Mexico on the orders of Z40 and his brother and presumed successor, Alejandro, alias ""Z42"" or ""Omar."" Ismael Lopez Guerrero, alias ""Gilberto Godina Guerrero,"" was also added to the list for allegedly sending large quantities of smuggled cash to Ramirez after collecting the illicit funds from the Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo, along the US border. (See attached indictment below) The move to place the men, who were both captured in Mexico last year, on the Kingpin List means all their US-based assets will be frozen -- with the Treasury stating they expect to seize approximately $20 million in goods and cash -- and US citizens are prohibited from engaging in business with them. The US government's real target with this announcement is likely Z42, who is thought to manage a good part of the financial side of the Zetas' operations from Nuevo Laredo and surroundings. Omar's ability to keep control of what is left of this now disparate criminal group may hinge on his ability to find some cash to pay off would-be government protectors, as well as internal and external rivals. The US is putting the squeeze on anything Zetas-related it can find. The Zetas' financial operations have been in the sights of the US authorities since well before the capture of Trevino. Last year, nine alleged Zetas members were indicted in Texas on money laundering conspiracy charges, among them Eduardo Trevino, alias ""Aldo,"" -- Trevino's uncle, who is now in a US jail cell for these activities. With Z40's arrest, this process is now likely to speed up, as the US authorities act on whatever intelligence they can glean from both the Zetas kingpin and the two alleged money launderers that were arrested with him."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Argentinas Extortion Gangs Move to Virtual Kidnappings. The arrest of six members of a family running an extortion gang in Buenos Aires has drawn attention to a new trend in extortion in Argentina, known regionally as ""virtual kidnappings."" La Nacion reported these extortion networks gather information on potential victims through techniques such as running false promotions on the street where they gather names and telephone numbers, or by gleaning it from social media. The gang then calls the victims, usually in the early hours of the morning, and tells the person answering the phone a family member has been kidnapped. In the background another gang member cries, screams and pleads for them to send the ransom. If the person does not fall for the ruse, the gang immediately hangs up and moves on to the next number. Some gangs make up to 200 calls a night, according to La Nacion. There have been several such gangs dismantled throughout Argentina over the last year, including one in the city of Rosario. Since police dismantled the Rosario network, there have been no further reports of attempted ""virtual kidnappings"" in the city, but there has been a series of reports of extortion attempts in which callers say they are members of the notorious local drug gang Los Monos, reported La Nacion. The callers then threaten to take over their victims homes and make them into drug labs if they are not paid. Extortion in Argentina has yet to reach the epidemic levels seen in countries such as Colombia, Mexico and the Northern Triangle in Central America, but the growth of homegrown organized crime networks in the country means it may well become a major security concern in the future. As it becomes more prevalent, criminals are likely to develop new techniques to capitalize on a growing market, such as those exposed in the recent cases in Buenos Aires and Rosario. Both ""virtual kidnapping"" and impersonating drug gangs echo extortion methods employed elsewhere in the region. In Colombia, for example, extortion gangs have used techniques such as pretending to be police holding a family member under arrest and soliciting a bribe to let them go, or impersonating armed groups to intimidate victims. In Mexico, groups also use the specter of some of the country's most prominent criminal groups to scare victims into depositing money into a bank account."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Honduras Transport Extortion Generates $27 Mn Annually: Govt. New government studies have revealed extortion of Honduras' transport sector earns criminal groups more than $27 million each year, highlighting the extent of a crime that pervades Central America. Studies conducted by the Honduran Security Ministry found that over 15,000 buses and taxis in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, which are extorted and forced to pay a so-called ""war tax,"" contribute an estimated $27.4 million to criminal organizations, reported El Heraldo. The size of these profits has reportedly made extortion one of the most lucrative enterprises in Honduras, with the crime costing the transportation sector over $1.2 million monthly in the Honduran Central District -- Tegucigalpa and Comayaguela -- and over $1 million per month in San Pedro Sula. The investigation found owners of bus companies in these two places pay a daily rate of $15 to $30 per bus. Transportation workers in Tegucigalpa recently went on strike to demand government action in the face of rising extortion. Workers told El Heraldo they asked the Security Ministry for support, but that the state advised them to continue paying the fees until a solution is found. In the past four years at least 350 transportation sector employees have been killed, with 80 percent of these deaths related to extortion payments, reported El Heraldo. Transport extortion is part of a wider phenomenon that has devastating economic and social consequences in Honduras. Gangs in Tegucigalpa were estimated to extort $15 per week from the city's 14,000 street vendors and kiosks in 2013, and contributed to the closure of an estimated 17,500 businesses in a year. Extortion is also a major source of profit for gangs in Honduras' ""Northern Triangle"" neighbors -- Guatemala and El Salvador. In El Salvador, around 70 percent of small businesses have reported being extorted , and the activity earns gangs almost $1.5 million per month. Criminal groups also frequently target Guatemala's transportation sector and, as in Honduras, there are regular reports of transport workers being killed. The crime has proved difficult for Northern Triangle governments to combat. A program that placed undercover officers on El Salvador's buses was halted last year due to a lack of funds. In Honduras, attempts to tackle bus extortion with patrols have shown few results. New Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez has pledged to be tough on crime , but the question remains of whether he will more successfully address this rampant problem than his predecessor."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Colombias BACRIM Count More Than 3400 Fighters. Police in Colombia have stated that the country's major drug trafficking syndicates currently have more than 3,400 members, present in at least 15 of the Colombia's 32 provinces. The leading daily newspaper, El Tiempo, reported that Colombia's National Police registered 3,410 armed members of the BACRIM (from the Spanish ""Bandas Criminales""), the latest generation of drug trafficking organizations. The article went on to note that the BACRIM have a presence in 130 municipalities in 15 of the country's provinces. The government now recognizes the existence of three BACRIM, down from over 30 in 2008. These are the Urabenos, the Rastrojos, and the successor groups from the Popular Revolutionary Anti-Terrorist Army of Colombia (ERPAC). The Urabenos are far and away the most powerful BACRIM in the country now, with 2,650 members, over 70 percent of the total number of BACRIM registered by the police. They are the only BACRIM with national reach, as illustrated in our map below, which shows the group's presence based on data from 2013. However, the Urabenos are also under the greatest pressure from law enforcement, both national and international. The arrest yesterday of Cesar Daniel Anaya Martinez , alias ""Tierra,"" one of the group's senior commanders, is the latest sign of this pressure. The police believe they are closing in on the Urabenos top leader , Dario Antonio Usuga, alias ""Otoniel,"" and that his capture is imminent. The numbers given by the Colombian police are interesting, but perhaps slightly misleading. Such is the nature of Colombian organized crime today: much of the work carried out by BACRIM is subcontracted out to other lower-tier criminal groups, or common criminals. Thus while the core, armed members of the BACRIM number around 3,400, the total manpower the groups are able to call upon is actually a great deal higher. Also relevant is the recognition that the Urabenos are today the most powerful BACRIM in Colombia. The Urabenos not only dominate the drug trade within Colombia, but now have a presence in many other countries around the region , and further afield. If recent arrests are anything to go by, it seemed the Urabenos are working aggressively to exploit the European market , leaving Mexico's domination of the US cocaine market largely unchallenged. Of the other two BACRIM recognized by the Colombian government, the Rastrojos appear to be in terminal decline after the surrender of their leader Javier Calle Serna, alias ""Comba,"" while the ERPAC dissident group the Liberators of Vichada , under the leadership of Martin Farfan Diaz Gonzalez, alias ""Pijarbey,"" is aggressively expanding ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Cultivating More Coca Than Bolivia, Peru Combined: UN. The United Nations' latest estimate of coca cultivation in Colombia is again substantially lower than US government estimates, but both lead to the same conclusion: coca cultivation has surged over the past two years as growers are offered greater incentives at lower risk. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's (UNODC) yearly publication on illicit crops in Colombia estimates that cultivations shot up 39 percent from 69,132 hectares (ha) in 2014 to 96,084 ha in 2015. That follows an increase of about 43 percent in 2014. Bo Mathiasen, the UNODC representative in Colombia, said the country is now cultivating more coca than Peru and Bolivia combined. The UNODC report put Colombia's 2015 cocaine production potential at 646 metric tons, up 46 percent from the 442 it estimated in 2014. By comparison, US government figures obtained by InSight Crime in May 2016 estimated Colombia's 2015 coca cultivation at 159,377 ha. While the UN figure is 40 percent lower, the US and UN estimates produced similar year to year increases in the area under cultivation, at 42 percent and 39 percent, respectively. The difference between US and UN estimates is due to different methodologies used by each. The UNODC said four factors made significant contributions to the coca cultivation increase. Coca leaf reached its highest price in 10 years, shooting up 39.5 percent to $1.02 per kilogram (3,000 Colombian pesos). The report said 64 percent of Colombia's coca farmers sell their crop in leaf form, while the rest partially process the leaves into coca paste and 1 percent of producers make more refined coca base. The greater incentive was reflected by an 11 percent rise in the number of households involved in coca farming, to 74,500. Bigger than average production increases were noted in indigenous reservations (52 percent) and Afro-Colombian communities (51 percent). Coca farmers also faced lower risk of crop loss due to the government's decision to halt aerial spraying and because growers themselves mobilized protests that effectively blocked security forces from carrying out manual eradication in some areas. The UNODC also cited increased expectations that coca producers might benefit from more heavily funded crop substitutions programs as a result of the government's peace process with rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). Finally, the report cited local factors affecting other cash crops, like fuel shortages, localized drought, and the general lack of alternative development activities. Colombia's eradication and interdiction efforts provided mixed results in 2015. The UNODC reports the number of coca or cocaine processing laboratories destroyed increased 64 percent to 3,827, and cocaine seizures rose 71 percent to over 252 metric tons. Aerial fumigation, however, fell 33 percent to 37,199 ha in 2015, and UNODC-verified manual eradication dipped 8 percent to 4,905 ha. Total eradication statistics -- including forced eradication that was carried out in coordination with grower communities, and aerial fumigation -- have fallen 52 percent compared to the past five-year average. Departmental figures show that the department of Narino, in southwest Colombia, led the nation in coca cultivation with 31 percent of the total, or 29,755 ha -- up 72 percent from 2014. Putumayo, in the southwest, came in second with 21 percent, or 20,068 ha, followed by Norte de Santander in the north, which accounted for 12 percent of total cultivation. InSight Crime has reported on several factors cited by the UNODC as contributing to the current coca boom. For instance, coca farmers have been organizing to protest government efforts to suppress the activity for several years, and as the UNODC report notes, the government has not had much success in addressing their concerns through development alternatives. Citing police reports, the UNODC says there were 140 incidents in 2015 of farmers blocking law enforcement activities. Field research by InSight Crime supports government assertions that the FARC has been telling communities in their areas of operation that coca crops will result in greater benefits from the peace process, now in its final stages of negotiation. The FARC is estimated to control up to 70 percent of the country's coca fields, providing protection and market access to the farmers. In addition to prospects for peace affecting coca cultivation trends, dynamics of the drug trade are sure to affect guerrilla compliance with the expected final agreement to end the civil conflict. The cocaine trade is believed to generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the rebels, and these profits heighten the likelihood of some guerrilla fighters refusing to leave the field. In at least one FARC unit -- the Eastern Bloc's 1st Front -- rebels have already announced that they will not disarm, and FARC commanders themselves attributed this resistance to economic interests linked to the drug trade. The current administration has made it clear that coca crop substitution will be a top priority for Colombia's ""postconflict"" plans. On July 10, the government launched a pioneer campaign to replace coca with alternative crops in Briceno municipality, Antioquia, with the collaboration of FARC members. The effectiveness of such development initiatives -- which so far have only benefitted 32 percent of coca-growing areas, according to the UNODC -- will be key to suppressing drug production in the near future."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"In El Salvador, Bukeles CICIES Only Seems to Exist on Paper. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele is launching a commission to crack down on cases of corruption and impunity among the country's political and economic elite, but the lack of involvement of agencies responsible for criminal investigations raises serious questions. On September 6, Bukele, accompanied by an envoy from the Organization of American States (OAS), announced the creation of the International Commission against Impunity in El Salvador (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad de El Salvador -- CICIES). Without providing much detail, the agreement establishes that the future commission will be tasked with ""supporting, strengthening and actively collaborating with institutions responsible for preventing, investigating and sanctioning acts of corruption."" On September 24, the OAS named Guatemalan lawyer Ronalth Ochaeta as the commission's acting spokesperson. His mission for the next few months will be to establish relationships with members of the judicial system and El Salvador's Attorney General's Office in order to ""strengthen"" the final agreement. The CICIES has already opened its first two cases. The first is related to alleged corruption surrounding the construction of the hydroelectric dam known as El Chaparral during the administration of former president Mauricio Funes (2009-2014), who is currently a fugitive from justice in Nicaragua. The second case is addressing the potential misappropriation of state funds during the construction of SITRAMSS, a public bus service in the capital, San Salvador. However, there is confusion about the CICIES' jurisdiction in such cases. President Bukele has not clarified the role the Attorney General's Office will have alongside the new body. The Attorney General's Office, for example, has had an ongoing case about El Chaparral since 2016. The CICIES announcements, made within the first 100 days of the new presidency, are an attempt to check the box on one of Bukele's main campaign promises. Bukele was elected in large part because of his promise to rein in endemic corruption in a country in which three of the last four presidents have been investigated for the misappropriation of public funds. But neither Bukele nor his officials have responded to the most important question surrounding the CICIES: how will the new commission co-exist with the Attorney General's Office, the only agency constitutionally mandated to carry out criminal investigations and prosecutions? While there has been at least one meeting between Bukele's representatives and the Attorney General's Office about the CICIES, days after the commission was set up, Attorney General Raul Melara declared that his office ""is the only entity that can investigate and prosecute crimes in the country."" The participation of public prosecutors has been crucial in other instances of such anti-corruption commissions in Central America's Northern Triangle, including the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala ( Comision Internacional contra la Impunidad en Guatemala -- CICIG) and the Support Mission against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras ( Mision de Apoyo contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad en Honduras -- MACCIH). In the case of the CICIG, an agreement between the United Nations and the presidency gave the commission independence in its investigations and accompanied Guatemala's Attorney General's Office in prosecutions. But public prosecutors remained in charge of criminal prosecution. The MACCIH, also supported by the OAS, can also support Honduran prosecutors with criminal litigation, but does not have the independence to decide which cases to investigate. Therefore, a CICIES without the participation of the Attorney General's Office does not seem to make much sense. In addition to this lack of clarity, another factor calls the CICIES' efficiency into doubt as long as it remains under the supervision of the executive branch. President Bukele is facing corruption allegations of his own. While Bukele has enjoyed a rapid rise to the top, his short political resume already has several potential blemishes. The most recent was the discovery that he personally received $1.9 million from Alba Petroleos , which receives funds coming from Venezuela's state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA). He was in turn investigated for potential money laundering in El Salvador and the United States. In 2018, El Salvador's Supreme Court found indications that Bukele received illicit funds. This included close to $850,000 given as a donation by a family business that also worked as a government contractor, on which he also did not pay taxes. The Supreme Court decided not to indict him but did order an investigation into tax evasion and handed the case over to the Finance Ministry. However, it is unlikely that the case will be pursued as Bukele is the chief of the ministry. Questions about the CICIES extend beyond El Salvador's borders. In early October, a UN mission visited the country's capital and met with the president to discuss the CICIES. Little came out of this visit and an international official with knowledge of what was discussed in that meeting told InSight Crime that it's still unclear if the UN will participate in the creation of the future Salvadoran commission. In Washington DC, four Democratic members of Congress, led by Norma Torres, released a statement in which they expressed support for the idea of the CICIES, but insisted on the importance of its independence from the Executive Branch. ""It is critical that CICIES be politically independent but with strong oversight, preferably from multilateral institutions,"" the statement read."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Weekly InSight: Argentina Takes a Step Towards Militarization. In our July 26 Facebook Live session, InSight Crime's Spanish Editor Ronna Risquez and Managing Editor Josefina Salomon discussed recent changes to the role of Argentina's armed forces and their impact on the country's fight against organized crime. On July 23, President Mauricio Macri announced a series of changes to the role of the armed forces in Argentina. In a speech Macri gave at one of the largest military bases in the country, he said the armed forces will be deployed for use in a "" deterrent or effective "" way against any kind of external threat. On the same day, he repealed a 2006 decree that had limited the use of the armed forces to defense against threats from other nations. Macri stated that on August 1 a total of 500 army soldiers will join members of the gendarmerie at the country's northern border to support logistics and to deter criminal organizations from taking root in local towns. Risquez and Salomon talked about the various reactions to the announcement, which included misgivings regarding the need to deploy the armed forces when the country already has two militarized security forces (the gendarmerie and the coast guard) in charge of policing the border. People also asked about the lack of established protocols for how the forces should act under the new circumstances they will face. Salomon explained that several experts consulted by InSight Crime said important changes such as this should be based on a wider consensus, which can only be accomplished through a debate and vote in Congress. The experts also highlighted the experiences of other countries in the region -- Mexico , for example - where security strategies based on militarization to combat organized crime and violence have backfired. The editors finished up by examining the details of the security strategy the government is implementing to combat the real threat that drug trafficking poses in Argentina, which has gone from being a transit country to one of increasing consumption and production. They also pointed out to the lack of sufficiently effective measures to fight corruption, which allows criminal groups to operate freely within the country.

"Pirates Threatening Brazilian Amazon Highlight Regional Security Concern. Marauding pirates represent a growing threat along the Amazon river in Brazil, the New York Times reports, but this remote outpost is not the only place in Latin America where piracy is becoming a greater security concern. Police forces in Brazil are struggling to curtail river piracy in the Amazon river basin, as a series of recent attacks have terrorized riverboat crews and their passengers, reported the New York Times. This September, nearly a dozen men raided a ship near the port city of Belem, robbing some 260 passengers. The following month, armed pirates commandeered a fuel ship, stealing more than 2,600 gallons of diesel fuel, along with the crew's personal items. ""Every riverboat captain knows they're at the mercy of these bastards,"" said Merinaldo Paiva, whose passengers were held up at gunpoint by pirates in April. While piracy is a longstanding issue in the Amazon, boat operators told the Times they fear the groups are becoming more savvy in choosing their victims. Galdino Alencar, the president of a boater's union in the state of Amazonas, said that pirates are now focused on going after large cargo ships, especially those carrying fuel. Due to the expansive and remote terrain that the Amazon encompasses, as well as the sparse police presence, combating river piracy has proven elusive for authorities. ""There's no law on the Amazon River,"" one local fisherwoman told the newspaper. Many of the factors fueling piracy on Brazil's Amazon are also contributing to robberies on rivers, lakes and the high seas in other parts of the region. In the last few years, there have been multiple reports of armed pirates boarding ships and looting passengers in the near-by Peruvian Amazon region. Meanwhile, Venezuelan pirates involved in a host of criminal activities have attacked fishermen and stolen machinery from petroleum platforms on Lake Maracaibo, causing delays in oil production. And off Ecuador's Pacific coast, pirates strapped with AK-47s have reportedly taken to hijacking fishing boats , using the vessels to transport drugs or other contraband items. Fishermen say the pirates offer large sums of money in exchange for their complicity. Those that refuse the offer are rarely heard from again."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Venezuela Pilots Extradition Could Lead to Cartel of the Suns Revelations. Colombia has extradited a Venezuelan former army captain with ties to the administration of President Nicolas Maduro to face drug trafficking charges in the United States, in a move that likely has Venezuela's government worried over what stories he might tell US authorities. On June 24, Yazenky Lamas was flown to the United States where he will be tried for his alleged role in coordinating over 100 drug flights from Venezuela to Central America and the Caribbean, reported Semana. Prosecutors allege that Lamas played a central role in organizing drug flights by obtaining air traffic codes that allowed the planes to pass themselves off as commercial flights, among them a flight that travelled from the Venezuela-Colombia border region to Honduras with 1.6 tons of cocaine in 2015, according to Semana. Lamas, who used to be the personal pilot of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores, according to El Nuevo Herald, was arrested in Colombia in June last year. He claimed to be sourcing pedigree dogs, but Colombian investigators told Semana they believe he was in the country to make contact with the powerful paramilitary mafia known as the Urabenos. Lamas is a figure with political connections that run to the very top of the Venezuelan government, and if he decides to turn informant he could potentially provide devastating information on the Cartel of the Suns -- the term used to describe drug trafficking networks inside Venezuela's military. There have already been strong indications of concern on the part of the Maduro administration; the Nuevo Herald reported that late last year government envoys pleaded with their Colombian counterparts not to extradite the former military man to the United States. Such tactics have succeeded previously, most notably in the case of Walid Makled, a now-convicted drug trafficker with high-level state connections, whom the Colombian government extradited to Venezuela instead of the United States in 2011. However, the political context is very different now. In 2011, Colombia was keen to improve relations with Venezuela -- which at that time was politically polarized and economically struggling, but far from the collapsing state seen today. Colombia also reportedly had favors to ask in return , namely, the extradition of Colombian guerrillas and the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of trade debt. In contrast, the Venezuelan government today is increasingly internationally isolated over its brutal attempts to put down a wave of political protest, and its inability to resolve an economic crisis and rampant corruption. In this context, pressure over the Venezuelan government's alleged collusion in drug trafficking has been steadily building, with US authorities prosecuting cases such as the ""narco nephews"" case involving the first lady's nephews, and levying a series of sanctions against state actors, including placing Vice President Tareck El Aissami on its ""Kingpin List."" Colombia therefore would have little to gain and much to lose by cooperating with a government that is not only approaching pariah status internationally, but -- depending on what Lamas tells US authorities -- could also be on the verge of being exposed as a criminal state."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
Record Homicides in Argentina City Points to Criminal Spillover, Feuds. Record level homicides in Santa Fe, Argentina have prompted a reshuffling in the local security command along with a ban on weapons, amid growing concerns over insecurity in this northeastern city, which is located along the country's principal route for trafficking cocaine. On October 18, the number of homicides in the Santa Fe metropolitan area rose to 119 thus far this year, with the shooting of a 19-year-old youth. This number has now surpassed the previous record high of 116 violent deaths in 2007, reported La Nacion. In the midst of the city's security crisis, the provincial vice minister of security has resigned and has been replaced with retired Gendarmerie General Gerardo Chaumont, reported La Nacion. Chaumont has experience training police in war zones and is expected to emphasize improving police operations in Santa Fe. The city's mayor, Jose Corral, has also temporarily prohibited the sale of firearms and ammunition, according to news site Ambito. In addition to the 119 murders, 1,200 people in Santa Fe have been injured in attacks this year, 760 with bullet wounds, reported El Litoral. This pattern of homicides in Santa Fe follows a similar trend seen in the neighboring city of Rosario, where murders reached record levels in 2013 as gangs struggled for control of the local drug markets. Santa Fe may be seeing some spillover violence, as the remnants of Los Monos -- a gang that was largely dismantled in Rosario -- reportedly began expanding operations to Santa Fe as of May 2014. Santa Fe is located just to the east of the Ruta 34, the principal highway used to traffic cocaine down from Bolivia into Argentina, which ends in Rosario. This geography likely makes it vulnerable to many of the same influences that have affected Rosario. As Argentina's status as a drug transit nation has grown, and the presence of foreign cartels has deepened, local drug gangs have been bolstered by the growing domestic drug market. Some of these gangs -- like Los Monos -- have begun showing signs of sophistication , operating with networks of hired assassins and issuing threats to officials. One member of Los Monos even attempted to begin producing his own cocaine.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Journalist Gunned Down in North Mexico Border State. The director of a news website has been gunned down in northern Mexico, raising the question of whether the country's new administration will begin to tackle the country's plague of violence against journalists. Jaime Guadalupe Gonzalez Dominguez, who ran the website Ojinaga Noticias, was shot 18 times in the street in Ojinaga municipality, Chihuahua's state, on March 3, with bullets that can pierce bullet-proof vests, reported El Financiero. Attackers stole his camera before escaping in two vehicles, according to the local prosecutor's office. Gonzalez was accompanied by a woman who was apparently unhurt in the attack. The late journalist's news website posted an announcement of his death, stating that it would likely be the publication's last posting. Later, it was shut down , leaving just a message reading ""This site has been suspendedplease come back later."" The Juarez City Journalist Association (Asociacion de Periodistas de Ciudad Juarez) said Gonzales was the 18th journalist murdered in Chihuahua since 2000, and that in most cases no one had been arrested for the murders, reported El Diario. The organization has demanded that the government investigate this most recent crime, which is the first journalist homicide case faced by the new administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto. Gonzalez' murder adds to a list of journalist killings that occurred over the course of 2012. Among these were the November murder of a Puebla journalist and a wave of six murders of journalists in spring 2012 , with four of these occurring in Veracruz, one in Sonora and one in Morelos. All of these states are among those seriously afflicted by the country's violent drug war. Federal agents responsible for security for Chihuahua newspaper El Siglo de Torreon were also attacked over the course of three days in late February 2013. InSight Crime has reported on the state's failure to provide protection to members of the press in Mexico, which became the world's most dangerous country to be a journalist under previous President Felipe Calderon. Journalists are often targeted by criminal organizations for publishing damaging information, with many now resorting to self-censorship to protect themselves. Reports vary on the numbers, with the National Human Rights Commission reporting 81 homicides since 2000 as of May 2012 and press freedom advocacy agency Article 19 counting 95 murders since 2006, as of November 2012. As of July 2012, there had only been one prosecution in the cases of 67 journalist murders and 14 disappearances since 2006. In June 2012 a law providing special protection to human rights activists and journalists was signed by Calderon , following pressure from members of these organizations. However impunity remains widespread. This case will be the first test of President Pena Nieto's commitment to those who stand for freedom of speech, in an administration that has made improving national security a top priority."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"US-Mexico Cooperation Falters to Advantage of Gun Runners. Cooperation between Mexican and U.S. authorities on arms trafficking has dropped off in recent years, even as traffickers continue to move huge quantities of arms across the border while taking advantage of legal loopholes. Since Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in 2012, cooperation between the U.S. and Mexican authorities on ending arms trafficking has decreased, reported the Global Post. The Global Post cites a January 2016 United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that noted that in 2011, US officials evaluated 22,097 guns seized in Mexico, compared to just 15,142 in 2014. According to officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) this shift in the numbers does not necessarily mean that there are fewer guns being trafficked to Mexico. Instead, it likely points to a fluctuation in cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico. The GAO noted that in 2011, when the number of guns evaluated by the U.S. was the highest, the Mexican government had widely implemented a software program called Etrace which allows Mexican officials to enter information on seized weapons for U.S. officials to evaluate. However, in 2012, when Pena Nieto took office, he pulled access to the program for many Mexican officials. This was part of Pena Nieto's broader strategy to reevaluate law enforcement cooperation with the U.S. On the U.S. side, the GAO report also points to continued hesitation by U.S officials to collaborate with Mexican officials due to perceived corruption. Some analysts believe that the decrease in collaboration is a sign of lack of political will: ""I don't get any sense of 'the fierce urgency of now' from any of the parties on the Mexican or US side when it comes to dealing with the issue,"" Joy Olson, executive director of the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) told Global Post. Insight Crime Analysis Lack of political will and cooperation may be part of the reason that up to 85 percent of the 15 million guns in Mexico are illegal, but other factors also play a role. Legal loopholes make it easier for innovative traffickers to import guns. The GAO report details how gunrunners now legally buy firearm parts which they smuggle to Mexico and assemble there. Other reports have noted how loopholes in U.S. laws regarding foreign guns have allowed traffickers to move Romanian and Bulgarian weapons into Mexico. In addition, illegal trafficking from external providers is hardly the only source of weapons in Mexico. Mexico's legal arms imports grew by 331 percent over the last five years, compared to 2006-2010. Paulina Arriaga, the director of gun control advocacy group Desarma Mexico, told the Global Post that Mexican tracking of legal firearms is ""rudimentary"" at best, making it is easy for these legal weapons to slip into the illicit market."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
"Infiltration of Chile Air Force Emails Highlights LatAm Cyber Threats. A group of hackers from Peru has infiltrated email accounts from Chile's Air Force containing sensitive information on strategic weapons, underscoring Latin Amercia's vulnerability to cyber crime. On August 14, the Chilean Air Force (FACH) confirmed that two of its institutional email accounts had been infiltrated, days after Peruvian hacker group Lulz Security Peru took responsibility for the attack on its Twitter account (see below), reported El Mostrador. The FACH told El Mostrador the institution first noticed the breach in May 2013 and took immediate security measures. Although the FACH claimed the information in the emails did not pose a risk to national security, El Mostrador reported that one of the infiltrated accounts belonged to the logistical command's Department of Contract Administration and contained information on negotiations with various international defense companies. Emails between the FACH and an Israeli defense company, for example, revealed information on strategic weapons as well as improvements made on a fleet of F-16 fighter planes. Lulz Security Peru stated in a message that the cyber attack was revenge for a 2009 incident in which Chilean hackers posted a painting depicting the War of the Pacific -- which the two countries fought in the late 1800s -- on a Peruvian government website. Hoy esten al tanto Leak de correos de la FUERZA AEREA DE . contratos militares secretos, comunicaciones, inteligencia. by LulzSecPeru -- Lulz Security Peru (LulzSecPeru) August 6, 2014 The public report of this cyber attack comes amid growing concern about the region's vulnerability to cyber crime. Last week, the Police Community of the Americas (Ameripol) announced the creation of a regional cyber security center to evaluate threats and provide support to law enforcement bodies. Several Latin American countries have also recently updated their criminal codes or created special security units to address this issue. The FACH is far from the only Chilean government institution to fall prey to cyber attacks. According to the website Zone-H -- which reports on hackers -- Lulz Security Peru has also attacked the websites of Chile's Justice Ministry and the Army's Non-Commissioned Officer School. Additionally, the hacker group ""Anonymous"" has infiltrated Chile's national library and Ministry of Education websites , as well as the website of Colombia's former intelligence agency and the Facebook page of Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. These cyber attacks highlight the potential political and security concerns hacking presents, but many cyber criminals have financial motives. In 2013, Colombia and Brazil were among the top 10 countries in the world for economic losses from phishing -- the online theft of financial or personal information -- which cost both countries close to one hundred million dollars ( pdf ). Meanwhile, a cyber crime scheme discovered in Brazil in July this year targeted around $3.9 billion in online transactions and is believed to be the largest electronic theft case ever reported."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Mexico Captures Sinaloa Cartel Head in Central America. Authorities in Mexico have captured the head of the Sinaloa Cartel's Central American operations, likely provoking even greater upheaval in Honduras' criminal underworld. On April 11, Mexican security forces captured Cesar Gastelum Serrano, alias ""La Senora,"" in the southeastern resort city of Cancun, reported The Associated Press. Less than four months prior to his arrest, the US Treasury Department had designated Gastelum Serrano to its ""kingpin"" list for being one of the Sinaloa Cartel's largest cocaine suppliers. According to the US Treasury , Gastelum Serrano used a ""vast criminal network to lead a cocaine trafficking organization capable of moving tons of cocaine per week through Honduras and Guatemala to Mexico."" Gastelum Serrano operated out of Honduras in the city of San Pedro Sula, where he allegedly collaborated with the Valle drug clan, one of the country's largest transport groups, reported Excelsior. According to Mexican authorities, Gastelum Serrano also worked with Sinaloa Cartel leader Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada. US officials believe Gastelum Serrano was the most prolific drug trafficker in Central America, and his arrest will only increase the state of flux in Honduras' criminal underworld. A significant number of Honduras' major drug traffickers have been captured over the past year, and top leaders of the country's two biggest drug transport groups -- the Valles and the Cachiros -- are now in US custody. This may lead to increased drug-related violence in what is already one of the world's deadliest countries. A string of killings in 2014 in San Pedro Sula was attributed to infighting between Sinaloa Cartel factions, and Gastelum Serrano's capture will likely further weaken the cartel's ability to maintain order among its operatives in Honduras. Gastelum Serrano's arrest will also likely incite fear among some of Honduras' elites, given the previously exposed close ties between drug traffickers and the country's political establishment. At least four Honduran traffickers extradited to the United States have already signaled their willingness to offer authorities information on their accomplices in the hopes of receiving a reduced sentence or other benefits. Finally, Gastelum Serrano's capture indicates that Mexican authorities are likely cooperating with their Honduran counterparts in operations targeting high-profile drug traffickers. This would represent an important development, given the expanding influence of Mexican cartels in this Central American nation."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombias New Generation Drug Gangs: The Power to Corrupt. Defectors from the Rastrojos, one of Colombia's most powerful gangs, have revealed a payroll of corrupt officials in one region of the country, giving a glimpse of the ability of these neo-paramilitary groups to penetrate the security forces. The leader of the Rastrojos in northern Antioquia, Angel de Jesus Pacheco, alias ""Sebastian,"" was killed after a heated argument with his two bodyguards on July 25. After shooting their boss six times and tying him to a tree, the gunmen, known respectively by the aliases ""El Negro"" and ""Guadana,"" turned themselves in to the authorities. Asides from telling the story of how Pacheco died -- after he reportedly had three of his former bodyguards killed, suspecting them of betrayal -- El Negro and Guadana brought with them a more valuable source of intelligence: the group's payroll records. The documents describe how branches of the security forces in the Bajo Cauca received regular payments from the Rastrojos in return for allowing the group to operate with impunity. According to details published by El Tiempo , the local office of the police intelligence agency, known as DAS, received 15 million pesos (about $8,400) in January alone. This is the same sum received by the military's anti-kidnapping unit, known as GAULA. The police station in Caucasia, one of Antioquia's most violent municipalities, received double that amount, 30 million pesos (about $16,800). The books also name individuals on the Rastrojos' payroll: one police officer in the anti-narcotics unit, for example, was allegedly paid two million pesos ($1,120) between November 2010 and January 2011. It is possible that, in exchange for the cash, these corrupt elements in the security forces actively aided the Rastrojos, instead of just taking a passive stance towards the group's illicit activities. This could have involved providing the Rastrojos with weapons from official stockpiles, a common way that groups arm themselves in Bajo Cauca, or else slipping them valuable intelligence about security operations, perhaps including the identity of police informants. The Rastrojos have demonstrated a substantial ability to buy off local authorities, especially in their areas of influence in southwest Colombia and along the Pacific coast. In November 2010, six naval officers, including three lieutenants, were arrested in Tumaco, Narino, charged with receiving up to five million pesos (about $2,700) in bribes from the Rastrojos every month in return for allowing drug shipments to pass through. The Rastrojos have also proved they are capable of corrupting political and judicial officials: in May, 39 people, including a member of the municipal council and a court secretary, were arrested in Choco province , accused of links to the group. According to El Tiempo , the payroll books provided by Pacheco's bodyguards also list local government officials in Bajo Cauca. So far this year, there are 100 police officers under investigation for their links to criminal gangs, Defense Minister Rodrigo Rivera recently said. InSight Crime's Spanish-language media partner, Verdad Abierta , counts 700 members of the security forces under investigation, including 350 members of the military, and close to 300 police who've been removed from duty for suspected links to groups like the Rastrojos. The Colombian government has tried to distinguish the new generation of criminal groups from their paramilitary predecessors, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC ) paramilitary group, by describing them as ""criminal bands"" (bandas criminales - BACRIM). But as Verdad Abierta notes, evidence of collaboration between the security forces and the BACRIMs points to a common thread running from the AUC era. When groups like the Rastrojos prove they have the ability to thoroughly penetrate state insitutions, this raises the question of how accurate it is to describe such a highly organized and powerful group as a mere ""criminal band."" But it is important to note that the security forces' current collusion with the BACRIMs looks very different from that with their AUC predecessors. Now, the emphasis is on the business of drug trafficking: corrupt elements of the police and military are enlisted to actively help move and protect drug shipments , or else to turn a blind eye to the group's operations in a given area. The AUC, on the other hand, worked with the military and police to persecute suspected members of leftist guerrilla groups. Across the country, elements in the security forces lent the paramilitaries helicopters and trucks for transport and fed them intelligence about their rivals , which sometimes included other paramilitary factions. The AUC and the Colombian military are also known to have conducted joint operations together, although in some cases, like the massacre of Mapiripan which left 50 civilians dead , the army ""supported"" the operation by refusing to take action against the AUC. Northern Antioquia, which includes the Bajo Cauca region, was the birthplace of the AUC and the site of several noted cases of collaboration between the paramilitaries and government forces. But the primary interest of the paramilitary blocs active in Bajo Cauca, led by warlords "" Macaco "" and "" Cuco Vanoy ,"" was drug trafficking, not the ideological war against the guerrillas. As a result, there is a tradition here of authorities accepting an extra million pesos, or more, in return for leaving the cocaine trade in peace. Things could get worse in Bajo Cauca. So far there are no signs of the security forces sharing vehicles or equipment with groups like the Rastrojos. Nor is there evidence that the military or police are favoring one BACRIM over another, as occurred in the Eastern Plains, where rival AUC blocs battled for territory while the government took sides. Bajo Cauca is a key transit area for cocaine passing from Medellin to the Caribbean coast, or for coca base entering from coca-rich municipalities like Anori. So long as the BACRIMs continue to fight over control of this region, they will look to gain an advantage by buying off members of the security forces. Judging from the records of slain drug lord Angel de Jesus Pacheco, he found it a very worthwhile investment. "	0	1	0	1	0	0	0
"Mexico Strikes Blow Against Caballeros Templarios Gang in Michoacan. Mexico's Federal Police have reported successes in their struggle against the emerging Caballeros Templarios drug gang, including the arrest of a key financial operative. On Saturday, the Public Security Ministry (SSP) reported the arrest of Cristina Guadalupe Iniestra Medina , alias ""La Cris."" She was captured in the city of Zitacuaro, in the group's home state of Michoacan. According to the authorities, Iniestra was responsible for managing a portion of the group's funds, reporting directly to German Ivan Rivera Aguilar, who received orders from gang head Servando Gomez Martinez, alias "" La Tuta ."" Earlier in the week federal forces detained Victor Chavez Gomez, alias ""El Ruso,"" in the Michoacan municipality of Lazaro Cardenas. He was a driving in a car that was found to have been stolen from the state of Tamaulpias. Gomez allegedly admitted to being a member of the criminal group, and having taken part in an attack on federal agents on July 7 in the city of Apatzingan. The Caballeros Templarios (Knights Templar) is an offshoot of the Familia Michocana , a drug trafficking organization which operates mainly in the state of Michoacan. Like its progenitor, the Caballeros promotes a quasi-religious ideology. The group is currently a priority target of the Mexican government. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"US Plays Catch Up With Engagement Strategy in Caribbean. A new US engagement plan for the Caribbean is a sign that the major drug-consuming nation has started to plug a hole in its security and drug trafficking prevention strategies in the region. On June 21, the United States unveiled a new aid program, "" Caribbean 2020: A Multi-Year Strategy To Increase the Security, Prosperity, and Well-Being of the People of the United States and the Caribbean ,"" to a region in the Americas that has increased in importance as a drug trafficking hub and transhipment point in recent years. The strategy establishes the priorities of the State Department and US Agency for International Development (USAID) ""in the areas of security, diplomacy, prosperity, energy, education, and health."" Regarding security, the plan is to work to ""dismantle illicit trafficking networks, enhance maritime security, confront violent and organized crime, and increase the sharing of threat information among countries,"" according to the US Department of State. To achieve this, the plan will rely on bilateral and regional cooperation, strengthening partnerships between government and civil society, and reinforcing crime-monitoring institutions. With this new focus, the US is finally giving some much-needed attention to a neglected region that has recently regained enormous importance in the international drug trade. A recent string of large drug seizures has confirmed a growth in trafficking -- in March, US Coast Guard officials seized almost 1.5 metric tons of cocaine in two operations in the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and in June, authorities offloaded 1.1 metric tons of cocaine in Puerto Rico, seized from Dominican traffickers. In addition to increased coca production in Colombia, the Caribbean region has become increasingly important as a drug trafficking hub and transhipment point thanks in part to the growth of transnational drug trafficking in Venezuela. The movement of cocaine from its western coasts to nations in the Caribbean has grown in line with the political and economic crisis ravaging the country, which has fed criminality throughout the regime and also created a poor, desperate, eager workforce prepared to take high risks for low pay. InSight Crime research in the Dominican Republic shows Venezuelans are replacing Colombians as either drug mules carrying product via flights or as crew on the many speed-boats arriving on its shores. Four out of the five speedboats arriving on the DR's coasts carrying cocaine shipments now have Venezuelans on board, according to interviews with law enforcement officials in the DR. Verny Troncoso, the lead prosecutor in charge of narcotic cases for the province of Santo Domingo, told InSight Crime that every week since late October 2016, officials have captured three to four Venezuelans arriving at the country's airports with drugs either ingested or hidden in suitcases. Dominican transnational criminal organizations are expected to ""remain a viable threat"" to the US drug market, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration's 2016 National Drug Threat Assessment. Official sources on the island suggested to InSight Crime that the country was handling up to 130 tons of cocaine per year, a large percentage of which is destined for European markets. Another factor driving traffickers back to the Caribbean are other US-funded anti-narcotic initiatives in the region. A focus on Mexico through the Merida Initiative and on Central America through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) has encouraged drug traffickers to seek less-policed routes."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Brazil Deploys Military to Rio Favelas for Local Elections. Brazil has sent 3,000 troops to occupy favelas in Rio de Janeiro which were not included in the government's ""pacification"" program, a move aimed at protecting candidates and voters from interference by drug gangs and militia groups during Sunday's local elections. The plan, which was initiated in response to reported threats from drug traffickers, involves reinforcing security in at least 28 Rio localities in the run up to Sunday's elections, reported EFE. The operation began on October 1 in Gardena Azul, a favela located in Jacarepagua, a neighborhood in the western part of Rio de Janeiro, and will end on Sunday. According to O Jornal do Brasil , the military will only operate between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Two thousand soldiers will patrol neighborhoods in the western part of the city with a high presence of vigilante groups comprised of former and current police, known as ""militias."" Favelas which are predominantly controlled by drug gangs will be occupied by 1,000 Navy troops, according to EFE. The president of the Regional Electoral Tribunal of Rio, Luiz Zveiter, told Veja that the armed forces will not enforce public security, but will help election officials deal with possible threats to free and fair elections, particularly illegal propaganda. Zveiter also stated that cell phones will be prohibited inside voting booths to help cut down on militia or gang intimidation of voters. Since 2008, Brazilian authorities have been attempting to ""pacify"" Rio's favelas, in order to reduce crime ahead of the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games. This process has involved first ""invading"" favelas with large numbers of police and military troops, then installing Pacifying Police Units (UPPs) who are trained in community policing techniques. Besides cutting down on crime, the goal of pacification has been to break the control of militias and drug gangs, who often virtually run the favelas. In the absence of state authority and services, criminal groups often serve as the de-facto government. These groups, along with community organizations, also often serve as the go-between for politicians wishing to essentially buy the votes of favela residents. This latest move shows that, despite successes in UPP areas, the government still has an enormous amount of work to do in order to fully implement state control in Rio's favelas. The favelas that have received soldiers this week may not be violent enough to warrant a UPP unit, but the fact that militias and drug gangs pose a serious threat to elections there raises questions about how the government will address these areas in the long term."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Journalist Killed While Reporting on Stolen Fuel. The latest death of a reporter in Mexico, who was gunned down in broad daylight in the state of Puebla this week, highlights the incredible risks faced by journalists in the country and the difficulty in finding the motives that led to their murders. On November 14, Adrian Silva Moreno was killed by three unknown gunmen as he returned from reporting on a story, according to El Universal. A 27-year-old former municipal police officer who was accompanying Silva was also killed. Silva had just finished covering a military raid on a warehouse allegedly filled with stolen fuel. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) , just minutes before his death, Silva called a fellow journalist to tell her that he had just witnessed a shootout between the military and gunmen at a roadblock. It is unclear whether this shootout was connected to the military raid in the warehouse. Silva then added that he had found ""something very important"" while reporting on the fuel theft story. Criminal groups are known to steal fuel from the pipelines of national oil company Pemex, and resell it to local gasoline vendors. Silva was a freelance reporter for various local media outlets, and also covered the crime beat for the online news and radio website Global Mexico. His murder marks the first time a journalist has been killed by an armed group in Puebla, according to CNN Mexico. Over the course of President Felipe Calderon's six-year term, which ends in two weeks, Mexico has become the most dangerous country in Latin America for journalists. Article 19, a press freedom advocacy organization, has compiled a map of threats and violence against the Mexican press (see below), and counts 95 journalists murdered since 2006. The frequent attacks have stifled press freedom in the country , and fear of reprisals either from criminal groups or corrupt officials have forced many media outlets to engage in self-censorship. While Mexico did pass the so-called Law for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists in June, making violence against journalists a federal crime , a climate of widespread impunity remains. As of August, a special government investigative body set up to prosecute crimes against journalists had yet to obtain a single conviction. More recently, the official investigation into the murder of journalist Regina Martinez Perez, who was killed in Veracruz while working for the muckraker magazine Proceso, raised questions , as officials have not yet acknowledged the fact that Martinez may have been killed due to her extensive reporting on organized crime and police corruption."	0	0	0	1	0	1	0
"An Economic Approach to Fighting Mexicos Drug Cartels. Formulating effective strategies to combat Mexico -based crime organizations requires a nuanced understanding of their economic structures, says award-winning Mexican journalist Carlos Loret de Mola. At a November 23 event hosted by the Americas Society/Council of the Americas (AS/COA), Loret gave a presentation entitled "" The Evolving Economics of Mexico's Drug Cartels ,"" in which he argued for an economic approach to tackling organized crime. ""I am totally convinced that there [can be] no war against drugs, there [can be] no law enforcement in terms of cartels, if you don't first of all understandthe economy of the cartels,"" he said. Loret, a columnist for El Universal who also hosts a television show and a radio program, began studying Mexico's drug trade as a university student in the late 1990s. Since then, he says, several factors have combined to create ""a whole new world"" for organized crime in Mexico. The defeat of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Mexico's 2000 election cycle disrupted long-standing arrangements between cartels and corrupt politicians that had formed during the PRI's 71 years in power. At the same time, some criminal groups that previously focused mainly on drug trafficking began branching out into more violent criminal activities , like kidnapping and extortion. Additionally, Loret argues, due to increased US border security after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, ""a lot of drugs stayed in Mexico,"" leading to the growth of domestic retail drug markets. Over the past two decades, Mexican crime groups also deepened their relationships with foreign suppliers of precursor chemicals used for drug production, which has helped them meet rising demand for heroin and methamphetamine on both sides of the border. These shifting market dynamics, combined with the implementation of a ""kingpin strategy"" aimed at taking out top cartel leaders, contributed to the ongoing fragmentation of Mexico's underworld , which, according to Loret, set the stage for the development of several distinct business models for Mexico-based crime organizations. One is the model of "" La Tuta ,"" the recently captured leader of the Knights Templar , who concentrated his organization's efforts on using coercion to extract profits from individuals and industries in areas under the group's control. The other model is that of "" El Chapo ,"" the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. ""He avoids confrontation with the government"" and focuses almost entirely on drug trafficking, Loret said. ""He doesn't go into kidnapping. He doesn't go into extortion."" ""In between,"" Loret added, ""you can find something like Los Zetas "" or the Gulf Cartel. ""They do not work like El Chapo in terms of not messing around with anybody. They do not work like La Tuta , seizing almost every activity of the local economy. But they tax,"" he says, charging ""protection"" fees to local businesses and other criminals seeking to operate in areas they control. For Loret, money laundering is ""the key issue"" when it comes to fighting the cartels. And he says policymakers have been slow to recognize this, continuing to rely instead on an outdated strategy of attempting to capture kingpins and deploying large numbers of security personnel to areas with high crime rates. Such policies often fail to have a long-term impact on crime and violence while contributing to the migration and decentralization of criminal networks , thereby making them harder to dismantle. Although it may sound simple in theory, tackling the issue of illicit financial flows has proven difficult in practice. Criminal groups have adopted sophisticated methods of laundering their profits. Moreover, banks and other financial institutions have an incentive to resist enforcing or adopting strict anti-money laundering standards. ""We can expect, except for a few cases of unprecedented honesty, for banks to cover up the origins of dirty money,"" Loret told InSight Crime. ""Raising penalties for banks who engage in these types of activities would work if the government is capable of detecting the illegal flows of cash and those institutions that allow them to come through, but this isn't the case: governments fail to detect these, so who is left to sanction?"" In addition to improving the capacity of law enforcement to clamp down on illicit financial flows, Loret argues, governments should concentrate their efforts on investigating and understanding criminal economies. ""For the poor farmers that work for the narco cartels, whenever they have a choice, it's a surviving choice. It's not an ambition thing,"" he said. ""It's because of the state not being able to provide good jobs, good opportunities, and some sort of future for them that they become farmers for the local cartels."" ""When looking at the narcoeconomy, we can conclude that the government's aim is not to completely eradicate drug cartels,"" Loret said. ""The sudden disappearance of drug cartels would trigger a brutal economic crisis that no government wants to have in their territory. I believe governments are actually trying to reduce the negative externalities of the illicit activities: less violence (executions, extortions, kidnappings, etc.) and less hard drugs available in the internal market."" In his presentation, Loret also stated that he supports drug legalization. He pointed out that drug prohibition amplifies the profitability of substances like marijuana and heroin, which are cheap and easy to produce but can be sold at high markups once they are trafficked to foreign markets. ""I think the strategies that have been implemented so far have failed. So why not try something different?"" he said. Loret also highlighted the necessity for international cooperation in combating organized crime, specifically citing the United States as the country best positioned to provide financial and technical assistance. ""These are international organizations who can have people across not only the continent but in Asia and EuropeThese are multinationals, and they work as multinationals,"" he said. ""No country can fight this by themselves."""	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
UN Secretary General Visits Guatemala. As Latin America prepares for President Obama's visit , Guatemala will receive the United Nations (UN) Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, IPS News reports. While Obama will be in El Salvador next week as a final stop in his three-country tour of Latin America, the UN's Secretary General will be visiting Guatemala mainly to sign an agreement to extend the mandate of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG ). He will also attend a summit with representatives of the Central American Integration System (Sistema de la Integracion Centroamericana - SICA ). Issue regarding drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) and organized crime also rank high on the agenda. La Razon reports that a major laboratory was found and dismantled yesterday by Bolivian anti-drug authorities. According to the Special Antidrug Task Force (Fuerza Especial de Lucha Contra el Narcotrafico - FELCN) it is the fourth major lab found so far this year, and was able to produce at least 400 kilos of cocaine per week; it was found some 110 kilometers near the country's most populated city, Santa Cruz. Some four Colombians were reportedly arrested but so far there have been no indications of their possible relationships to Colombian DTOs. Authorities also noted that the lab was technologically more advanced than the previous ones found in Bolivia. At least 6,500 liters of chemical liquid precursors were also seized at the scene. The Naval Forces from 11 countries in Latin America, as well as the U.S. Coast Guard, are meeting in Guayaquil, Ecuador, on March 15 and 16 for the Ninth Multilateral Maritime Anti-drug Summit (Novena Cumbre Maritima Multilateral Antidrogas). The forum will primarily concern better strategies to tackle maritime drug trafficking in the hemisphere. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Peru Destroys Record 50 Tons of Marijuana Plants. Police burned over 200,000 marijuana plants in plantations in central Peru, in the biggest ever operation against the drug crop. According to Peru's Interior Minister, Wilfredo Pedraza, the 50 tons of marijuana destroyed in the five-day operation amounted to 17 times more than the police had destroyed in the whole of 2011, the BBC reported. The destroyed crop, valued at $15 million in the US market, represents a record for the Peruvian National Police, according to La Republica. Pedraza said the operation, dubbed ""Mono Rojo"" (Red Bow), was evidence of the success of the government's intensified fight against drug trafficking. It began on July 27, and covered sites in the central regions of La Libertad and Huanuco. (See Reuters' video report on the operation, below.) Although Peru is most notorious for its coca production, some reports indicate that marijuana growing in Peru has been on the rise in recent years. The United Nations' International Narcotics Control Board's (INCB) 2011 annual report called on the Peruvian government to examine a trend of increased cannabis herb seizures. The US State Department's 2012 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report indicated a rise in cannabis seizures in recent years, but noted that the total area of cultivation is still unknown. Last month, the police destroyed 34,000 marijuana crops in Huanuco. Milton Rojas of the Peruvian Center for Information and Education for the Prevention of Drug Abuse (CEDRO) told the BBC that domestic consumption drives most marijuana production in Peru and that unconfirmed accounts indicated that the plants were being grown alongside coca crops.

"Will Synthetic Drugs Replace Cocaine in Latin America?A high-ranking official in Peru has suggested synthetic drugs will fill the void left by a shrinking market for cocaine, a perhaps exaggerated claim that nonetheless reflects changing patterns in drug consumption. ""The cocaine market is going to be reduced over the next two decades but the world will have a very dangerous synthetic drug market that is going to need to be regulated,"" said Peru's anti-drug czar , Alberto Otarola, on November 10. The official's comment came one day prior to the start of the 58th session of the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission ( CICAD ) being held in Trujillo, Peru. Otarola offered as evidence for his claim the huge variety of synthetic drugs being produced, which has frustrated interdiction efforts. According to the CICAD, authorities from around the world have so far detected 300 different classes of synthetic drugs. ""A new [synthetic] drug is being created every day,"" Otarola said. Otarola added that trafficking synthetic drugs is ""now much easier"" than smuggling cocaine, since many of the drugs are not expressly prohibited by law. Otarola's remark reflects the growing concern over a burgeoning synthetic drug market in Latin America. A 2014 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime suggested that synthetic drug consumption is increasing throughout much of Central and South America, particularly Brazil and Argentina. The growing synthetic drug threat has been compounded by authorities who find themselves unprepared to respond to the wave of new drugs reaching the market. In fact, this is not the first time synthetic drugs have been seen as usurping cocaine's importance in Latin America. Following the seizure of over 3,000 capsules of the drug 2CB in 2013, a Colombian police chief claimed synthetic drugs are "" gradually replacing cocaine ."" But the predicted fall of the cocaine industry may be overblown. To be sure, cocaine usage in the United States -- long the world's top consumer of the illicit drug -- has fallen by an estimated 50 percent during the past eight years, while European markets also appear to be contracting. However, US drug official William Brownfield recently stated that cocaine consumption is once again on the rise , paralleling a huge jump in coca production in Colombia. Cocaine is also becoming increasingly popular among South American teenagers, suggesting it will remain a drug in high demand for the foreseeable future."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"High-Ranking Bolivia Police Gave Protection to Wanted Drug Trafficker. A number of high-ranking police officials in Bolivia have been arrested for their suspected links to a drug trafficker wanted for years by police in Brazil, but the full extent of their collusion has yet to be revealed. Authorities in Bolivia arrested Gonzalo Medina, the former head of the country's anti-crime force (Fuerza Especial de Lucha Contra el Crimen -- FELCC) in central Santa Cruz department, and former captain Fernando Moreira on drug trafficking and criminal association charges, as well as allegedly engaging in a cover-up, the Interior Ministry announced during a press conference last week. The announcement came after authorities discovered that Medina and Moreira had allowed suspected drug trafficker Pedro Montenegro Paz -- wanted in Brazil since 2015 for trafficking drugs from Sao Paulo to Europe -- to attend two official FELCC events in Santa Cruz while Medina was head of the unit, La Razon reported. Medina's stepson, Robin Oscar Justiniano Meruvia -- who has also since been arrested on drug trafficking charges, though he denies the allegations -- appears in a photo with Montenegro at one such official event. Montenegro allegedly attended alongside departmental and national authorities despite his arrest warrant. (Pedro Montenegro Paz (left) and Robin Justiniano, Medina's stepson (right), c/o El Deber ) What's more, Moreira's wife was allegedly pictured with Montenegro in Cartagena, Colombia, during the Carnaval celebration last year. Montenegro reportedly bankrolled the trip for himself and nearly 20 others, including Medina and Moreira. The expenses surpassed some $19,000 and Montenegro used a fake identification card to travel, according to El Deber. Members of Interpol's Bolivia office allegedly deleted data on Montenegro's arrest warrant from the system. The decision was originally annulled before later being approved by the Supreme Court, according to La Razon. Since these revelations came to light, the two former policemen have been put in pre-trial detention and a number of other officials have also been arrested. In addition, the entire anti-crime unit in Santa Cruz, made up of some 150 officers, has been suspended so authorities can conduct an audit. Lie detector tests and family vetting will also now become mandatory for police chiefs. ""The General Command of the Bolivian Police will not allow any corruption within their ranks, we prefer to stay with 100 honest policemen. Those who do not share this criterion will logically be sent to the Attorney General's Office or, where appropriate, to [prison],"" said Bolivia Police Chief Yuri Calderon. Evidence of high-ranking police officials colluding with drug traffickers is not a new dynamic in Bolivia. It is one of the main reasons that the Andean nation has become a key player in the international drug trade, not only for cocaine production , but also as a transit country and a hub for transnational criminal groups. Indeed, Bolivia's former anti-narcotics czar, Rene Sanabria, was arrested in Panama in 2011 on charges he and other police officials helped move drug shipments from near the country's southwest border with Chile to Panama and then onto the United States. In 2015, the country's former police chief, Oscar Nina, was arrested for suspected illicit enrichment and ties to the drug trade. It's unclear what the relationship between the recently arrested officials and the wanted drug trafficker was, but it may be related to the location of Santa Cruz department in a criminally strategic region bordering Brazil to the east and Paraguay to the south. The department is home to one of the country's centers for coca base production and has in the past been the scene of drug disputes driven by the criminal migration of traffickers from Brazil and Colombia. The low risk of interdiction due to a combination of police corruption and porous borders, among other factors, makes Bolivia an attractive place for the region's drug traffickers."	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"Bolivia Provides Less Than 1% of US Cocaine: Interior Minister. Bolivia's interior minister has stated that Bolivian cocaine makes up less than one percent of the cocaine sold in the United States, a figure that is likely too low, but nonetheless highlights the fact that Bolivia's drug exports mostly supply a different market from the U.S. Interior Minister Jorge Perez made this comment in response to a recent White House memorandum criticizing Bolivia and Venezuela for failing to comply with counternarcotics agreements, reported La Razon. He added that Bolivia's current administration has carried out a record number of anti-drug operations and arrests and seized an unprecedented amount of cocaine paste. He did not provide figures to support these statements. Perez's comments came shortly after Bolivian President Evo Morales rejected the White House report and said the United States no longer had the authority to scrutinize Bolivia's anti-drug efforts. Although it is not clear how Perez calculated the ""one percent"" statistic, his assertions do reflect the fact that the United States is not Bolivia's main market. The country is principally a supplier of cocaine to Argentina and Brazil. Aside from feeding the domestic market in these Southern Cone nations, Bolivian cocaine is often trafficked onwards to Europe. US authorities estimate that 80 percent of the cocaine in the United States comes from Colombia, and international intelligence sources have told InSight Crime that around 12 percent comes from Peru. Based on these calculations, approximately eight percent of cocaine on the US market would originate in Bolivia -- significantly higher than the one percent cited by Perez, but still a low figure. Perez's comments were made in the context of an ongoing political tit-for-tat with the United States. President Morales expelled the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) from Bolivia in 2008, after accusing the agency of conspiring to overthrow his administration. Since then, the White House has singled out Bolivia for failing to meet its anti-narcotics obligations in its yearly memorandums on major drug transit countries and producers. The Bolivian government claims that, to the contrary, the country has increased cocaine seizures and made considerable strides in the fight against drug trafficking since Morales took office in 2006."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Bolivia Says No to Brazil Cross-Border Coca Eradication. Bolivia's government said it will not allow Brazilian police to eradicate illegal coca crops within its borders, resisting Brazil's increased efforts to police drug trafficking in the region. In response to press reports that Brazil*wished to begin carrying out eradication operations in Bolivia, Bolivian Interior Minister Carlos Romero stated that the country had its own drug control policy and would not permit interference from outside forces. Romero did say Bolivia would continue to coordinate its border control actions with Brazil, La Razon reported. Brazil recently conducted cross-border eradication operations in Peru , destroying some 100 hectares of coca plants. On August 20, a representative from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Bolivia called on La Paz to accept international aid in the fight against drug trafficking, alluding specifically to Brazil's federal police efforts, according to the Council on Hemispheric Affairs. A Brazilian embassy official in Bolivia stated last December that up to 80 percent of the cocaine produced in Bolivia ends up in Brazil, Latin America's largest consumer of the drug. As US security aid in the Latin American has shifted its focus to Central America and Mexico, Brazil has stepped up its efforts to halt drug trafficking along its borders, becoming a major player in regional securit y. Despite Bolivia's rejection of Brazilian federal police entering its territory, it has accepted Brazil's technological assistance in the past to combat drug trafficking and illicit coca cultivation: in January, Brazil donated helicopters and drones to help Bolivia gather intelligence on illegal coca plantations. The incursion of Brazilian police may be viewed as too expansionist, however, for a country that has historically been very protective of coca consumption's place in its cultural identity. By keeping Brazilian police out of Bolivian territory, the Bolivian government can retain more control over its ""Coca Yes, Cocaine No"" policy instituted by President Evo Morales, which allows for up to 20,000 hectares of legal coca production each year."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Predicting the Fall of Guatemalas President. Although the walls are closing in on Guatemala President Otto Perez Molina, due to new revelations of his involvement in a massive corruption case, he may yet avoid prison. Guatemala's Supreme Court unanimously approved the Attorney General's motion to strip the president of his immunity , forwarding the case to Congress, where lawmakers will decide what happens next. Top prosecutors from Guatemala have accused Perez Molina and ex-Vice President Roxana Baldetti of running a customs fraud network known as La Linea. Perez Molina's center-right Patriotic Party, and its ally, the Lider party, currently hold a majority in Congress, which helped put an end to a previous attempt -- spearheaded by the opposition -- to vote to remove his immunity. However, with Guatemala's general election two weeks away, Lider party leaders may find it difficult to defend Guatemala's ""most disputed president ever,"" argued investigative news website Nomada. The president has repeatedly said he will not resign. Under Guatemalan law, Perez Molina's presidency will end the moment a judge decides to place him in preventative detention. At that moment, Vice President Alejandro Maldonado Aguirre will become the new head of state. While La Linea and other scandals have certainly created chaos and public outrage in Guatemala, there's no guarantee this will translate into prison time for Perez Molina. Guatemalan courts are notoriously easy for special interests to corrupt and manipulate. As InSight Crime has documented , this has allowed elites to turn the country into what is practically a mafia state. If Congress decides to strip the president of his immunity, the case will then be heard before a judge, who may decide the case doesn't merit a trial. And even if Perez Molina's case does make it that far, previous trials involving Guatemala's top political elites set a poor precedent for justice. For example, ex-dictator Efrain Rios Montt was convicted in 2013 of genocide and crimes against humanity. His 80-year sentence was then overturned on a technicality and he was later declared mentally unfit for sentencing. If genocide can go unpunished, Perez Molina may have a chance of escaping prison time over alleged customs fraud. On the other hand, if a sitting president in Guatemala is impeached and sentenced, this would send an unprecedented message to Guatemala's corrupt elites that the days of de facto impunity are over."	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Councilmen Describe Life of Fear Under Knights Templar. Councilmen from Michoacan have recounted life under a mayor who was in cahoots with Mexico's Knights Templar criminal organization, exemplifying how corruption and criminal control of local politicians works in practice. In an interview with Milenio , eight out of 12 councilors from the municipality of Apatzingan discussed their experiences working with municipal president Uriel Chavez Mendoza, who was recently arrested for extortion and ties to organized crime. Serving as the group's spokesman, Jose Martin Gomez Ramirez, Apatzingan's councilor for Industry and Business, nervously described two fearful years living at the mercy of the Knights Templar. ""It was a presidency full of threats,"" Ramirez said. ""From the moment we entered the council, the first day, they explained to us they were going to deduct $1,530 from us monthly,"" representing over a third of their $4,290 monthly pay. The councilors protested, and were taken to meet with the Knights Templar in a remote area. There, accompanied by men with guns and a municipal police patrol, Mendoza introduced Rigo Diaz Soto -- the Templar boss for the local plaza -- saying, ""He is my friend, but more than my friend, he is my brother."" Rigo explained to the councilors business was bad and they would have to comply with a temporary salary deduction. However, anyone with economic problems could write a letter to recently killed Knights leader Nazario Moreno Gonzalez , alias ""El Chayo,"" who Rigo said had a good heart and would support them if their concerns were legitimate. For the next two years Ramirez said they were indoctrinated with fear, with the Knights Templar and municipal officials threatening his family members and all those ""not supporting the movement."" In February 2012, the municipal council even held a meeting with the Templar leadership, shaking hands with El Chayo, Enrique ""El Kike"" Plancarte, and Dionisio Loya Plancarte, alias ""El Tio."" The corruption and intimidation of local politicians is a standard strategy used by criminal organizations to gain influence in their areas of operation, not only in Mexico but throughout the region. Over recent weeks, the level of corruption in Michoacan was highlighted by the investigation and arrest of two high-profile politicians, Jesus Reyna Garcia and Jose Trinidad Martinez Pasalagua , for links to the Knights. This new report highlights just how effective the Knights have been at infiltrating local corridors of power, a tactic that goes hand in hand with the direct threats against politicians the group has also been known for. It also underscores the pressure local and regional politicians commonly find themselves under to comply with criminal groups."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Arrest Shows Overlap of Legal, Illegal Mining in Colombia. The arrest of a Brazilian national who is both a registered miner in Colombia and the alleged ringleader of an illegal mining structure illustrates the nebulous division separating the country's legal and illegal mining sectors. Colombia's National Police arrested Jose Antonio Cavalcante, one of two Brazilians authorities say ran an illegal mining network in the northwest department of Choco. Nine other suspects were arrested in the sting. The group that authorities have dubbed ""The Dragons"" allegedly used 40 dredges to conduct gold mining operations along the Quito River in Choco. Police Gen. Jorge Rodriguez Peralta told El Tiempo that the operations produced roughly 20 kilos of gold per week with a market value of approximately $672,000. Authorities say the group's illegal mining caused significant environmental damage. Up to 37 children have reportedly died in the area due to consuming water contaminated by mercury, a harmful by-product of illegal mining. According to police, illegal armed groups -- including the Urabenos and the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) -- provided Cavalcante's network with armed protection in exchange for a cut of the mining profits. The government reported on April 26 that it had carried out almost 300 operations against illegal mining in the first four months of 2016 and had destroyed or confiscated more than 100 pieces of heavy equipment used for illegal mining, according to El Tiempo. Cavalcante embodies the tangled nature of Colombia's legal and illegal mining sectors. He is hardly an unknown figure in the illegal mining world; he was arrested in 2014 on similar charges. In 2012, the head of a sustainable development organization in Choco was sanctioned for soliciting bribes from Cavalcante, who had been fined for illegal mining on the Quito River. Despite Cavalcante's notoriety, he is also the legal representative of a registered gold mining company in Colombia. That the representative of an official mining company can allegedly double as a serial, flagrant violator of mining laws indicates a high degree of crossover between the illegal and legal mining sectors. It also reflects how poorly the government has regulated this industry. Criminal groups take advantage of this lack of oversight by charging illegal miners extortion fees, which are known locally as ""vaccinations."" This legal gray area is not just limited to Colombia's gold mining sector. For decades now, authorities have struggled to rein in the influence of armed groups and criminal actors over the lucrative emerald industry. The one-time ""Emerald Czar,"" Victor Carranza, even built his own paramilitary organization to protect his business empire."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"LatAm Leaders Call for Analysis of US Marijuana Legalization Initiatives. In a sign of increasing discontent with the dominant anti-drug strategy in the hemisphere, the heads of state of three Central American countries and Mexico have issued a joint statement calling for an analysis of the effects of recent votes to legalize marijuana in two US states. On November 12, the leaders of Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico and Belize released a statement declaring: ""It has become necessary to analyze in depth the implications for public policy and health in our nations emerging from the state and local moves to allow the legal production, consumption and distribution of marijuana in some countries of our continent,"" reported the Associated Press. The leaders have called on the Organization of American States (OAS) to review the potential effects of the votes in Colorado and Washington, with Mexican President Felipe Calderon calling the move a ""paradigm shift,"" in global drug policy. They also requested the United Nations General Assembly to hold a special session on drug prohibition within the next three years. Though the sale and distribution of marijuana for personal use will be legal in the two states, it remains illegal under US federal law. This joint declaration follows comments made by the head of Mexican President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto's transition team last week that Mexico will have to review its drug policy in light of the move to legalize, stating that the incoming government would find it difficult preventing marijuana trafficking if its consumption is permitted north of the border. According to a report by the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, Mexico provides about 40 percent of US's annual marijuana consumption. Calderon and Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla have both been critical of the existing punitive framework for drug policy in the past, with each saying a debate on new strategies, including legalization, is required. Honduran President Porfirio Lobo, on the other hand, has previously come out against legalization (See InSight Crime's map on drug policy positions throughout the region). The fact that the Colorado and Washington votes are causing drug policy hardliners -- Pena Nieto included -- to start calling for a review suggests the backlash against the US could grow over its perceived hypocrisy, as the country remains strictly opposed to drug decriminalization abroad."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"WhatsApp Led to 100 Crime-Free Days: Argentina Police. An Argentine police official says neighborhoods using a popular text messaging application to report suspicious activity have been crime-free for 100 days, an innovative strategy for improving citizen security that relies on strong police-community relations. In March, Police Commissioner Marcelo Guerrero installed a neighborhood watch program in several communities in the southern city of Rio Grande that enable citizens to alert police to suspicious or criminal activity via the text messaging platform WhatsApp. Guerrero -- dubbed by local media the ""WhatsApp Commissioner"" -- recently told Todo Noticias the six participating neighborhoods have gone over three months without crime. (See video below) These neighborhoods have a total population of nearly 20,000 people, according to Clarin. Each of the six neighborhoods have their own WhatsApp chat group, and individuals can join the network by presenting documents that verify they live in the community and do not have a criminal record, reported Clarin. High-level security officials in Tierra del Fuego -- the province where Rio Grande is located -- are analyzing the situation and are considering implementing the program in other police jurisdictions, reported Telam. Guerrero's claims that the new WhatsApp initiative has basically eradicated criminal activity over the past three months may be exaggerated, especially since many crimes committed in Latin America go unreported. Nonetheless, the apparent success of the program is a good example of how police can leverage popular social media platforms to improve citizen security. Unlike other attempts by governments in the region to lower crime via smartphone apps, in this case most users don't have to download a new application; 74 percent of mobile internet users in Argentina already have WhatsApp, according to Statista. However, these types of neighborhood watch programs require strong police-community relations. If citizens do not trust police, they are unlikely to report crimes, thus reducing the effectiveness of a security strategy that relies on a high level of cooperation between police and the public. The numerous reports of police corruption and brutality in Argentina suggests that the WhatsApp program could struggle to deliver similar results in other parts of the country. WhatsApp enjoys widespread popularity throughout much of Latin America, most notably Mexico and Brazil. Unfortunately, the same issues that could prevent the program from being successfully replicated in other areas of Argentina are all too common in both Mexico and Brazil ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Disappearance Statistics Highlight Turmoil in Tamaulipas, Mexico. Tamaulipas has some of the highest missing persons rates in Mexico due to major migrant routes that traverse the border state and an ongoing territorial battle between the Zetas and Gulf Cartel organized crime groups. Data released by Mexico's National Security System (Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Publica) show that Tamaulipas has the highest number of reported disappearances of any Mexican state with 5,583 missing persons. Following Tamaulipas were the states of Mexico state and Jalisco, with 2,830 and 2,390 disappearances respectively. A small percentages of cases are reported to federal courts, which provide a breakdown of disappearances by nationality as well as location. Tamaulipas accounts for the third highest number of those cases, with 149, behind the states of Guerrero, with 273, and Veracruz, with 190. The data represents the number of disappearances brought before state and federal courts up to April 30, 2016. A majority of the missing persons reported are Mexican, but there is a significant number of missing persons from various other nations. Federal court filings include reports of missing people from nations as varied as Poland and India. In Tamaulipas, the federal court system reported missing persons from Guatemala, Colombia, Brazil, Honduras, the United States and Peru. The publicly available data can be downloaded here. The high number of missing persons in Tamaulipas is disturbing, but unsurprising. Given that the state is both a major route for migrant traffic heading to the United States and a key battleground between two organized crime groups, the number of people who have gone missing in Tamaulipas could possibly be much higher than the cases reported to state and federal officials. Currently, both the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel are vying for control of Tamaulipas. The Zetas, who in 2014 operated in 5 federal jurisdictions, are now only present in Tamaulipas according to a government assessment, and the Gulf Cartel is reportedly contesting their control. Migration through Tamaulipas has long been dangerous , with multiple actors taking advantage of migrants. The issue made international news in 2010 with the infamous ""San Fernando Massacre"" of 72 migrants. As the Mexican government continues to crack down on migration in coordination with United States policy, migrants are being further squeezed by criminal actors. As long as Tamaulipas remains both a contested territory for highly aggressive organized crime groups and a major migration route, the number of disappearances will remain high."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombias Least-Known But Most-Wanted Public Enemy No. 1. Ex-FARC commander ""Gentil Duarte"" has risen to the top of Colombia's most-wanted list, but the relatively unknown figure turned public enemy number one may be a less significant threat than the hefty price on his head suggests. The Colombian government has named Miguel Botache Santillana, alias ""Gentil Duarte,"" as its top target and offered a reward of nearly $2 million for information leading to his arrest, El Tiempo reported on February 19. According to official documents and other sources accessed by El Tiempo, Gentil Duarte has amassed a following of more than 500 armed dissidents after breaking away from the peace process between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) at the end of 2016. He reportedly commands six dissident fronts of the now-demobilized guerrilla group that have traditionally had the deepest involvement in the drug trade. The former FARC leader is reportedly seeking an alliance with Gustavo Giraldo, alias ""Pablito,"" a top figure in the FARC's guerrilla cousin group, the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN). Pablito is thought to operate along Colombia's border with Venezuela, a key drug trafficking corridor. Gentil Duarte has also reportedly established contact with powerful Brazilian crime groups including the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) and the Family of the North (Familia do Norte - FDN), allegedly trading Colombian drugs for powerful weapons from Brazil. However, in contrast to the picture reportedly painted by Colombian authorities, InSight Crime field investigations suggest that Gentil Duarte is not the top leader of all dissident elements of the FARC. Rather, he is part of a ""board"" of rebel commanders that run the FARC dissidence much like a federation. The Road to Dissidence Before joining the FARC dissidence, Gentil Duarte was an important part of the peace process and served as a member of the initial delegation sent to attend negotiations in Havana, Cuba. In June 2016, when the commander of the FARC's 1st Front, Nestor Gregorio Vera Fernandez, alias "" Ivan Mordisco,"" became the first guerrilla commander to declare himself dissident, the FARC's ruling body sent Gentil Duarte to quell the rebellion. Naming Gentil Duarte, a member of the FARC's General Staff (Estado Mayor Central) with more than 30 years of experience in the organization, as the envoy to the 1st Front seemed like a logical choice. But shortly after he arrived at the unit's stronghold in the department of Guaviare, Gentil Duarte disappeared. As months went by, rumors began to circulate that he had been murdered by the rebels under Ivan Mordisco's command. The truth, though, turned out to be quite the opposite. Apparently, Ivan Mordisco had made Gentil Duarte an offer he could not refuse: join the dissidence and continue controlling the lucrative drug trade in Colombia's Eastern Plains. In December 2016, Gentil Duarte deserted the peace process and escaped with nearly $1.5 million and six of his most trusted men. In response, the FARC expelled Gentil Duarte along with four other dissident commanders operating in the Eastern Plains. The Ex-FARC Mafia Although Gentil Duarte is the most senior of the ex-FARC commanders in Colombia's Eastern Plains, he is not the leader of all dissident elements in the region. While there was a clear hierarchical command structure under the FARC, the dissident factions operate much more like a federation. InSight Crime field investigations suggest that Gentil Duarte is just one of several important commanders who make up the leadership of this federation. In fact, recent reports that Gentil Duarte is expanding his influence into the Amazon region and forging criminal alliances with Brazilian crime groups are likely the product of misconceptions about the structure of the FARC dissidence. As commander of the 7th Front, Gentil Duarte controls extortion and the drug trade in the central department of Meta. This may have put him in contact with Mexican criminal groups like the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, which has reportedly sent emissaries to the region. It is Ivan Mordisco, though, who commands the 1st Front and controls the criminal economies in the coca-rich departments of Guaviare, Vaupes and Guainia , the two strategic trafficking routes into Venezuela and Brazil. If the FARC dissidence is forging alliances with Brazilian cartels, it is likely the doing of Ivan Mordisco or one of FARC's most notorious drug traffickers, Gener Garcia Molina, alias ""Jhon 40"" or ""John 40,"" the former head of the 43rd Front who was expelled from the FARC in 2016 alongside Gentil Duarte. John 40 is likely based in the Venezuela state of Amazonas, on the tri-border area between Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. Reports of ex-FARC elements working with the ELN to traffic cocaine in Venezuela point to John 40's direct involvement. Two of the other expelled commanders, alias ""Giovanny Chuspas"" and alias ""Julian Chollo,"" are likely those spearheading the expansion into the Amazon. The Face of the Ex-FARC This is not to say that Gentil Duarte plays an insignificant role within the FARC dissidence. Regardless of the number of fighters he commands or the proportion of illicit revenue he controls, Gentil Duarte has become one of the most prominent faces of the FARC dissidence. A senior member of the organization, Gentil Duarte is well-respected by rebels both inside and outside the peace process. As such, his example could serve as inspiration for guerrilla elements that were never interested in peace or have become disillusioned by the peace process. Just a few months ago, the commander of the 27th Front, Edgar Mesias Salgado Aragon, alias ""Rodrigo Cadete,"" deserted the peace process to follow in Gentil Duarte's footsteps. The Colombian government's struggle to uphold its commitments under the peace process is likely to continue to undermine ex-combatants' commitment to demobilization. High-level defections like that of Gentil Duarte further threaten the still fragile peace process, and cast doubt on the government's ability to negotiate peace with Colombia's largest active armed group, The National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN)."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Peru Overhauls Criminal Code To Tackle Cyber Crime. Peru's government has proposed a raft of new laws to tackle cyber crime, a promising step in a region where law enforcement has failed to keep up with advancing criminal technology. The Repression of Cyber Crime Law, sent to Congress last month, aims to ensure that anyone who violates security measures to access part or all of a computer system without authorization will face legal sanctions. Anybody accessing information without having been given necessary passwords will automatically be committing a crime, reported La Republica. The law will impose jail sentences of differing lengths according to different types of information accessed or activities carried out. Those illicitly intercepting computerized data will face up to six years in jail -- ten years if the information is classified. Those using the internet to sexually proposition minors will receive sentences of up to eight years, and those distributing child pornography up to 12 years. Identity theft, including phishing and card cloning, will incur a penalty of up to five years. The law will also target those providing or creating equipment for other people to commit cyber crime, reported El Peruano. Existing laws were 15 years old and needed updating, and judges had complained they were not clear enough, lawyers told the newspaper. Cyber crime has become a major issue in Latin America, with more than half of all companies reporting some kind of attack in 2012. Malware -- computer software used to enter and damage or disrupt computer systems -- is a particular problem. A study released earlier this year which looked at 20 of 32 members of the Organization of American States found that incidents of cybercrime had risen between 8 percent and 40 percent in different nations from 2011 to 2012. The study also found that Latin American countries were struggling to keep up with criminals' advancing use of technology, and specifically cited a lack of adequate legislation as ""one of the main impediments to curbing illicit cyber activity in 2012."" Peru's efforts to overhaul its cyber crimes laws should thus be welcomed."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Mexico Not in League with Sinaloa Cartel, Insists Government. The latest in the Mexican government's series of ""myth-busting"" blog posts challenges the idea that authorities aren't doing enough to hunt down Joaquin Guzman, alias ""El Chapo,"" leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. Guzman heads Mexico's biggest drug trafficking organization, and is now the most wanted man in Mexico, if not the world. He has been on the run since escaping prison in 2001, and was recently described by an official from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as the biggest drug trafficker in history. Guzman's decade of liberty is an ongoing embarrassment to the Mexican government, especially with the emergence of claims over the years that the drug lord was living openly in the mountains of the Sierra Madre. There are stories about him marrying in a public ceremony in a local village, zooming through the region in a convoy of cars, and going out to eat in restaurants accompanied by his entourage. Meanwhile, there are suspicions that the government is focusing on pursuing members of other drug-trafficking organizations, at the expense of targeting the Sinaloa Cartel. An investigation by the U.S. radio station NPR in 2010 found that the number of Sinaloa members captured is disproportionately low, relative to those arrested from other criminal groups. All this, together with the rising fortunes of the Sinaloa Cartel, has led to suspicions that law enforcement may be on Guzman's side, perhaps working to eliminate the Sinaloa Cartel's rivals at the expense of targeting Sinaloan operatives, with ""El Chapo's"" unofficial blessing. Even the U.S. government has referenced such doubts; a cable sent by U.S. embassy staff in January 2009 and released by WikiLeaks referred to the ""widely held"" view that the army was allowing the Sinaloa and Juarez Cartels fight it out in Cuidad Juarez. The cable also noted that many thought the government would prefer Sinaloa to win, and that the army and federal police ""rarely"" had direct confrontations with the drug gangs. In one previous ""myth busting"" blog post , the government blamed previous administrations for their ""inaction and tolerance"" towards crime. The question is whether the Calderon adminsitration deserves suspicion that the Sinaloa Cartel is now facing similar ""inaction and tolerance"" from the authorities. It is true that the group probably enjoys close relationships with powerful elements in Mexico's law enforcement, perhaps more so than its rivals. However, rather than being evidence of a conspiracy, this is more likely a product of the Sinaloa Cartel's longevity and wealth, as well as the fact that it favors a more quiet, low-key approach than groups like the Zetas, who are more prepared to use violence to gain authority. An important distinction should be made between Calderon's administration and elements in the army, police, and local government. Clearly it would be impossible for such a famous fugitive to remain at large for so long within his own country without support from some sectors of the security forces. There are many areas of the county where officials, even at the highest levels, are in the pockets of traffickers such as the Sinaloans, but this does not mean that Calderon's government is backing the Sinaloa Cartel as a matter of policy. This is more a sign of the federal government's lack of control over their forces than of their complicity with Guzman. It's also possible that the Mexican government is simply attacking the groups strategically, going after the weakest first and leaving Sinaloa until last. Another factor is that the Sinaloans are simply using corruption rather than violence as their preferred business strategy, in contrast to the Zetas, known for burying scores of people in mass graves. This means by default, the Sinaloa Cartel must attract less attention from authorities, who must prioritize targeting the cartels who use brutal, attention-grabbing tactics that are most disruptive to public security. U.S. law enforcement may have its own part to play in allowing Guzman to remain at liberty. A group of hackers recently released documents which seemingly showed that in 2009 U.S. authorities had failed to alert Mexican law enforcement about a tip-off that the Sinaloa head and his associates had been gathered at a ranch near the Arizona border. However, this could itself be evidence that the U.S. authorities do not sufficiently trust Mexican forces to feed them information about Guzman. Recent reports have also placed Guzman outside of Mexico, suggesting that it is increasingly uncomfortable for him to operate in his home country. One unsubstantiated report claimed that the kingpin had moved many of his operations to Argentina , and had been living there for some months until March 2011. More recently, and perhaps more credibly, President Alvaro Colom said that he had repeatedly received intelligence reports saying that Guzman was in Guatemala, and that he was thought to move between Guatemala and Honduras. In a sign of how deep Guzman's influence goes, or how far people believe in the drug lord's boundless ability to corrupt, even Colom appeared to feel the need to emphasize his government is not protecting the Sinaloa leader (Guzman was arrested in Guatemala in 1993). ""We are behind him,"" said the president, ""and if we have not captured him it is simply because the information was incomplete or not timely."" (See a video accompanying the blog post, below.)

"Northern Triangle Now Deadliest Place on Earth. In a briefing at the Pentagon, Commander General Douglas Fraser of the U.S. Southern Command ( Southcom ) stated that the 'Northern Triangle,' made up of Honduras, Guatemala , and El Salvador, has likely become the deadliest region on earth outside of active war zones. He said that the United Nations (UN) put Iraq's 2010 murder rate at 14 per 100,000, whilst Honduras and El Salvador's rates soared to 77 and 71 per 100,000 respectively. The commander attributed this to the influence of the transnational crime organizations (TCOs) which are active throughout the region. Beginning in August, Brazilian drones will carry out surveillance over Bolivian territory as part of an agreement to help combat drug trafficking in the Andean country, La Razon reports. Brazil will deliver financial aid and offer training to Bolivian anti-narcotics authorities, cooperation that will start this year and run until 2013. It will also help combat related crimes such as money laundering, with special training for police and targeted anti-laundering software. With this move Bolivia joins Colombia and Mexico , which have also been allowing foreign unmanned aircraft, from the U.S. in their cases, to help tackle organized crime in their territories. According to a cable released by WikiLeaks via the Washington Post, Colombia has been using the drones since 2006, but Mexico only began doing so this year. El Colombiano reports that despite Colombian President Santos' declaration that this month would be a ""Dark March"" for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ), the guerrilla group was able to strike blows at the security forces, killing 21 and carrying out some 20 attacks nationwide. In the same period the authorities killed some 40 guerrillas. Experts consulted by the newspaper said that the rebels' counter-offensive could be a way to distract attention and trick the public into thinking they are not weak. InSight considers that, in either case, the FARC certainly saw an important loss when the security forces killed Arquimedes Munoz, alias 'Jeronimo,' and since it's a regional election year it is most likely that they will keep up attacks in key municipalities. In other news from Colombia, Caracol Radio reports that the Integrated Electoral Intelligence Center (Centro Integrado de Inteligencia Electoral), led by the ministers of the interior and defense and the National Electoral Council, has identified certain municipalities that are being targeted in the upcoming regional October elections, by the BACRIM (criminal bands, heirs to the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia, Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC ). According to the body, the BACRIMs want to place mayors in key municipalities with big revenues in order to take advantage of the royalties paid by foreign companies, such as oil firms in Vichada and Putumayo.

"UN Urges Mexico to Take Soldiers off Streets. The United Nations has urged Mexico to begin removing military personnel from policing functions, yet doing so may prove difficult in a country where soldiers have come to play a key role in providing domestic security. Speaking at a press conference on October 7 following a three-day visit to Mexico, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called on Mexico to ""adopt a time frame for the withdrawal of the military from public security functions."" (See video below) In his statements, Zeid said that during his visit he had encountered a ""very bleak"" picture of a society ""wracked by high levels of insecurity."" This includes an estimated 151,233 people killed between December 2006 and August 2015, and at least 26,000 missing since 2007. ""The citizens live in fear and don't feel they have the protection of the law,"" Zeid stated, adding that the police need a major reform and Mexico's attorney general's office needs to be strengthened. Detailing a conversation he had with Mexico's military leaders, Zeid told the audience he found there was agreement that having the military perform policing functions is not ideal, with Defense Secretary Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos unhappy about military units being ""dragged into"" policing work. Zeid therefore called on the Mexican government to ""act with urgency"" in reforming police and working towards providing stronger legal protections for citizens. The sooner this happens, the sooner the Mexican military can ""return to barracks,"" Zeid declared. Under former President Felipe Calderon, and continuing under current President Enrique Pena Nieto, Mexico has come to rely heavily on military units instead of police for providing security. In the face of Mexico's violent drug cartels -- and a police force nearly 90 percent of citizens perceive as corrupt -- deploying the military presents an attractive stopgap measure for Mexican leaders. Yet soldiers are trained to kill enemy combatants, not engage in standard policing behavior -- such as investigating crime scenes -- and the militarization of Mexico's domestic security has been linked to human rights abuses , massacres , and forced disappearances. The solution is better trained and funded police. But this is difficult in practice to achieve, and requires long-term investments and changes in institutional cultures that take time to demonstrate results. In the meantime, a side effect of Mexico's use of the military in domestic security is that state governments may come to rely on soldiers -- which are paid for by the federal government -- thereby disincentivizing local leaders from investing in police reform. Unfortunately, the military appears to be mutating into a more permanent feature of Mexico's domestic security apparatus, and extracting them from their policing roles will likely prove difficult."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Gang Breakdown Coincides with Kidnapping Rise in Mexico States. A sudden spike in kidnapping in Guerrero and Baja California has coincided with the ongoing deterioration of the organized crime structures that dominate the two west Mexico states. According to statistics published by the NGO Observatorio Virtual , the kidnapping rate in Baja California and Guerrero ticked upward in the first three months of 2016 even as the national rate has continued the decline it began in 2013. In Guerrero, the registered figure of 2.34 kidnappings per 100,000 residents is only a slight bump from the 2.27 registered last year, but it bucks a long-term trend, as Guerrero registered substantial declines in 2014 and 2015. The figure is the third-highest of any Mexican state this year, and nearly three times the national average of 0.80 per 100,000 residents. The kidnappings reported by Observatorio Virtual are concentrated in a relatively small number of Guerrero's municipalities, largely along the coast and in several small inland towns. Over the past 12 months, General Canuto A. Neri and Pedro Ascencio Alquisiras, both inland towns with populations under 7,000, saw kidnapping rates of 16.03 and 14.17 per 100,000 residents, respectively. Cualac, a comparably sized town near the state's border with Oaxaca, registered a rate of 13.99. The figure for Chilpancingo, the state's capital, was 7.49. While the prevalence of the crime in these hotspots was more than enough to make Guerrero one of the nation's most dangerous states for abductions, 48 of the state's 81 municipalities reported no kidnappings at all. In Baja California, Observatorio Virtual's data indicates circumstances that are largely better than in Guerrero. The border state's kidnapping rate for 2016 is 0.68 per 100,000 residents, just below the national average and 10th among the 32 Mexican states. This would seem to indicate a situation that is under control. However, the recent trend is more alarming. Baja California's kidnapping rate has more than doubled in 2016, driven by a rash of abductions in Tijuana, the state's largest city. The kidnapping rate in Tijuana over the first three months of 2016 has more than doubled compared to 2015. Kidnapping statistics are notoriously difficult to track, as many victims, believing that a ransom payment without the involvement of the police is the safest way to secure freedom, have a powerful disincentive to reporting it. As a result, any official kidnapping statistic vastly understates the real figure. But assuming these statistics reflect a genuine trend, and they probably do, then there are a few different factors likely driving them, with one in particular standing out. One key factor specific to both states is the years-long decline of the dominant criminal groups in each: the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) in Guerrero and the Tijuana Cartel in Baja California. Both have suffered years of setbacks with captures and killings decimating the leadership that built the organizations. The Arellano Felix family, which built the Tijuana Cartel out of an offshoot of the Guadalajara Cartel in the 1990s, has virtually ceased to operate. Founders Ramon and Benjamin Arellano Felix were killed and arrested, respectively, in 2002. After inheriting the operation, their brothers Javier and Eduardo were arrested in 2006 and 2008. Other relatives and subordinates have also taken up the reins, but none -- including Enedina Arellano Felix, the sister of the founders and reputed leader today -- have managed to restore the group to its prior influence. The result has been a period of substantial reorganization in Baja California. Reports have been somewhat contradictory, with some sources describing attempts by Arellano Felix veterans to recapture their influence, while more recently a government official indicated that the Jalisco Cartel was moving into the area. Whatever the case -- and these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive -- no single group has control of Baja California. Similarly, the BLO, once a dominant force along Mexico's southern Pacific coast, has declined precipitously. The erstwhile boss of the family, Arturo Beltran Leyva, was killed in 2009 in a shootout with security officials in Cuernavaca, a tourist haven between Mexico City and Guerrero. His brother Alfredo was captured shortly before then in an arrest that sparked the group's split from the Sinaloa Cartel, while Carlos was arrested shortly after. The last holdout, Hector Beltran Leyva, was arrested in 2014. The disintegration of the BLO has spawned a tangled network of splinter groups, such as Guerreros Unidos, Independent Cartel of Acapulco, Los Ardillos, Los Rojos, and many others. Without a hegemonic actor organizing these groups and divvying up responsibilities and profits, they have naturally come into conflict with each other, as well as other new actors tempted by the power vacuum. The absence of a single controlling entity at the top of the local food chain has long contributed to the rise of small-time crime, from bank robbery and car theft to extortion and kidnapping. There are different explanations for this phenomenon, which has manifested itself around the country. One is that the single hegemonic group is able to outlaw certain behaviors among local criminals, acting as a sort of underworld police. But when the hegemon loses its control, and the real police aren't able to step in to adequately punish kidnapping or other such crimes, then criminal actors are free to pursue actions that were previously beyond the pale. Another related explanation is that the big groups tend to have the readiest access to drug producers, whether South American cocaine or Mexican heroin, and the means to move major shipments. In effect, this means access to high profit margins. When a larger organization disintegrates, the revenues that come with trafficking substantial amounts of drugs dry up as well. As a result, the smaller cells that operate within the newly weakened group must find ways to replace their lost income, with extortion and kidnapping in particular emerging to take the place of drug shipments. It remains to be seen if the recent uptick in Guerrero and Baja California is a blip or the beginning of a new trend, but the collapse of the BLO and the Tijuana Cartel has certainly created the conditions for kidnapping to continue to rise in these troubled states.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Is Uruguay the New Argentina of Drug Trafficking?The recent arrest of individuals linked to Mexico's Los Cuinis criminal organization has drawn attention to organized crime's presence in Uruguay and the role of foreign drug traffickers in the deterioration of the country's security indicators. A report by Uruguayan newspaper El Observador traces the growth of violence and crime in Uruguay in recent years, highlighting how warnings from officials regarding criminal evolution have largely been borne out. For instance, drug seizure statistics back predictions by local security officials that Uruguay would become a transit nation for cocaine trafficked to Europe. According to El Observador, 10 kilograms of cocaine were seized in 1991, compared to 135 kilograms seized so far in 2016. Around 1.5 tons were seized in 2013. Increased drug transit has also contributed to an increase in Uruguay's drug consumption. Citing the International Narcotics Control Board, El Observador reports Uruguay now has the third largest cocaine consumer rate in South America, behind Chile and Argentina. These trends have been accompanied by an increase in violence as criminal groups compete for local drug markets. El Observador notes how, in the past, homicides in Uruguay consistently totaled about 180 to 190 per year, but that 2015 saw 289. Uruguay's Interior Ministry attributed a third of all homicides in 2013 -- around 80 -- to disputes between criminal groups, known colloquially as a ""settling of accounts."" For instance, on May 19, police discovered the tortured and dismembered bodies of two teenagers that had been missing since August 2015. Paid assassins typically carry out such murders, something officials note breaks with Uruguay's traditional violence trends, whereby homicides have typically been the result of domestic disputes or armed robberies gone awry. Fueling microtrafficking and violence is the presence of seasoned foreign criminals -- including drug traffickers from Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil -- in Uruguay's prison system. Such convicts bring with them important criminal contacts and methods that get passed on to fellow inmates and applied locally. This is partly reflected in Uruguay's recidivism rate of released prisoners, estimated at 60 percent. According to El Observador, Uruguay's Interior Minister Eduardo Bonomi said the majority of released prisoners who reoffend commit crimes that are more violent than those for which they were initially convicted. Outside prisons, Uruguayan authorities also fear a reported increase in the number of foreign drug traffickers visiting and living in places like Punta del Este may lead to violent criminal battles seen in cities like Acapulco, Mexico. The presence of foreign drug traffickers in Uruguay is under scrutiny following the April arrest of 11 individuals linked to Mexican criminal organization Los Cuinis, thought to be in alliance with the powerful Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG). Those detained include Gerardo Gonzalez Valencia -- brother of Los Cuinis leader Abigael Gonzalez Valencia -- who was allegedly laundering money through real estate properties in Punta del Este. Surprisingly, Gerardo is reported to have been living in Uruguay since 2011. Criminals from Mexico and Colombia looking for a refuge to unsuspectingly conduct business have been known to settle in South America's Southern Cone countries, particularly Argentina. Yet, as drug related violence in Argentina has escalated in recent years -- partly a result of the presence of foreign criminals -- it may be foreign drug traffickers are drawn by the relative calm of neighboring Uruguay. Indeed, that such a prominent Mexican drug trafficker was able to maintain residence in Uruguay for so long and avoid arrest hints at Uruguay's allure. Despite a small population of around 3.5 million limiting its status as a major drug consumer, Uruguay offers access to money laundering opportunities , as well as links to major drug markets across the Atlantic and in neighboring Brazil and Argentina."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Ecuador Makes Biggest Cocaine Bust of 2016 as Drug Seizures Rise. Ecuador has seized around 10 metric tons of cocaine at the Guayaquil port in the space of a few days, suggesting that the country may be growing in importance as one of Latin America's key drug transit hubs. Ecuadorean police made their biggest cocaine seizure of the year on December 2, when officials intercepted 7.5 metric tons of the drug in Guayaquil. The cargo had been destined for Honduras and was concealed in a container that should have contained 400 kilograms of shrimp feed. On November 29, Interior Minister Diego Fuentes announced the seizure of 2.5 metric tons of cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) in a banana shipment headed to the Netherlands, also in the Guayaquil port. The bust followed three months of investigations. Eight people were arrested. The following day, Fuentes told the press that security forces had seized 81.15 metric tons of total drugs so far this year, surpassing the 72 metric tons of drugs seized over the same period in 2015. Of this year's seizures, 68.45 metric tons correspond to cocaine HCl, higher than the 59 metric tons of crystalized and base cocaine intercepted over the whole of 2015, according to US figures. Ecuador's seizures have been rising over the past few years. The country intercepted nine metric tons more cocaine and coca base in 2015 than in 2014, according to US statistics, and the difference this year may be even steeper. The US State Department reports that maritime seizures have also followed this rising trend, ""despite the Ecuadorean Navy's lack of resources."" This suggests that Ecuador's role as a Pacific transit hub for drugs heading to consumer nations such as the United States and European countries may be growing in importance. While Ecuador itself does not produce any significant amount of cocaine, it is sandwiched between the world's two main producers of the drug -- Colombia and Peru -- and receives shipments from both ends. Central to this dynamic is Guayaquil, one of the continent's most important ports and an exit point for illegal drugs that has long been under the influence of transnational organized crime. The volume of legal traffic through the port greatly facilitates this movement, as only 20 percent of containerized exports are inspected, according to the US State Department. Guayaquil is also a meeting place for international criminal groups and a storage center for drugs. Indeed, seizures of the size seen recently are unusual, suggesting that a number of smaller drug loads were pooled together by different suppliers. There are indications that the Sinaloa Cartel is operating from this port city, and past seizures have been linked to Colombia's most powerful criminal organization, the Urabenos."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Authorities Have Institutionalized Contraband: Venezuela diplomat. A Venezuelan official has asserted Colombian authorities are responsible for rampant cross border smuggling, yet this finger-pointing ignores the dynamics of this illicit trade, much of which lie firmly on the Venezuelan side. On September 3, Venezuelan Chancellor Delcy Rodriguez lashed out at her Colombian counterpart Maria Angela Holguin over the ongoing border crisis between their two nations, asserting in a message posted to her Twitter account that the cross border contraband trade ""has been institutionalized by Colombian authorities."" 10.En cuanto al combustible y el contrabando a Colombia ha sido institucionalizado por sus autoridades. Venezuela exige apego a la ley! -- Delcy Rodriguez (DrodriguezVen) September 4, 2015 The message was part of a series of Tweets responding to criticisms by Holguin of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his handling of border closures in the state of Tachira. Declaraciones d Canciller Holguin es un compendio d imprecisiones erraticas, falsedades y confesiones d Estado apoyando crimenes en frontera -- Delcy Rodriguez (DrodriguezVen) September 4, 2015 Previously, during a meeting between the two chancellors in Cartagena on August 26 , Holguin said price differences created by subsidized goods and gasoline in Venezuela ""makes it very difficult to control contraband,"" reported El Espectador. ""It's unbelievable, to say the least, that (Holguin) uses Venezuela's policy of subsidization to hide the responsibility of Colombia in the fight against contraband,"" retorted Rodriguez. 2.Es insolito, por decir lo menos, que se excuse en las politicas de subsidios implementadas por Venezuela en funcion de su pueblo para -- Delcy Rodriguez (DrodriguezVen) September 4, 2015 3.escurrir la responsabilidad d Colombia en el combate al contrabando.Se les ha solicitado revisar Ley Anticontrabando q PROMUEVE est delito -- Delcy Rodriguez (DrodriguezVen) September 4, 2015 Blame for the contraband trade between Venezuela and Colombia can be placed on both sides of the border. It is undeniable Venezuelan price controls on basic foodstuffs and gasoline has encouraged smuggling of such goods into Colombia, where they fetch much higher prices. However, criminal networks in Colombia -- such as neo-paramilitary groups known as BACRIM (short for the Spanish ""criminal bands"") -- have propagated the contraband trade, earning profits by charging a ""tax"" on smuggled Venezuelan goods. Additionally, cocaine flowing into Venezuela from Colombia -- along with contraband moving in the opposite direction -- have had a corrupting influence on each country's border officials , facilitating illicit traffic moving in both directions. For instance, there are rumors this border crisis was set off by a clash between the Venezuelan military and National Guard over the drug trade. Nonetheless, as long as artificial price differences exist between the two countries, the cross border contraband trade will continue to flourish ."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Peru Drug Flights Shift North As Pressure Builds in Cocaine Hub. The destruction of nearly two dozen clandestine airstrips in central Peru suggests aerial drug traffickers are migrating away from the country's main hub for cocaine production in response to stepped-up interdiction efforts. Peru's Interior Ministry announced that the anti-drug unit of the National Police demolished 23 airstrips between September 3 and September 7. The airstrips were located in six municipalities that span the regions of Pasco, Huanuco and Ucayali. (See InSight Crime's map below) Members of Peru's aviation police, state agents specializing in the eradication of illegal coca, and representatives from the Attorney General's Office also participated in the operation as part of a new security plan for the first 100 days in office of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, whose term began in late July. The objectives of the 29-point plan are grouped into five categories : citizen security, organized crime, corruption, policing and institutional reform. The remote jungle valley known as the VRAEM has traditionally doubled as Peru's main hub for cocaine production as well as drug flights leaving the country. In just the first nine months of 2014, for example, Peruvian security forces destroyed 185 drug airstrips in the VRAEM region. One security expert told InSight Crime in 2014 that some 90 percent of the estimated 200 tons of cocaine produced in the VRAEM each year is flown out of the country on the crude runways hidden deep in the Peruvian forest. But the demolition of almost two dozen airstrips north of the VRAEM suggests that may be starting to change. In May 2016, the head of Peru's anti-drug police force, known as DIRANDRO, said that the majority of cocaine now leaves the VRAEM by land following the implementation of a drug plane shoot-down law last year. The continued destruction of clandestine airstrips has also made it increasingly difficult for cocaine traffickers to export their product using drug planes. Security analysts say increased interdiction in the VRAEM may have pushed more drug flights into areas such as the Masisea district in Ucayali. In addition to lighter security pressure, drug traffickers in Ucayali benefit from having the option of shipping cocaine on the Ucayali River. According to a 2015 report on Peru's coca cultivation from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( pdf ), airstrips in the region are located along the banks of the Ucayali, which renders them unusable when the river floods. But during the rainy season traffickers can simply send the drugs down the river, which connects to the Amazon and eventually reaches Brazil, the world's second-largest consumer of cocaine. The apparent shift from the VRAEM to Ucayali and other nearby regions highlights the limited long-term impact that destroying clandestine airstrips has on the illicit drug trade. New airstrips are easy to set up, and even those that are destroyed can be restored on the cheap in as little as 24 hours. Moreover, destroying airstrips has little impact on the profits made by illegal armed groups involved in the country's cocaine trade, as traffickers simply find other ways to smuggle the drug shipments across borders.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Canadian Company Custom-Made Encrypted Phones for Cartels: FBI. US authorities have arrested the head of a Canadian company that allegedly made millions of dollars selling mobile phones optimized for concealing criminal activities, showcasing the growing importance of encrypted communications for crime groups. Vincent Ramos, the founder of Phantom Security Communications, also known as Phantom Secure, was arrested on March 8 in the US state of Washington on charges that his company operated a secure telephone communications network that knowingly supplied encrypted phones to organized crime groups, including the Sinaloa Cartel. In a complaint filed in a federal court, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) alleged that ""Phantom Secure's networks were specifically designed to prevent law enforcement from intercepting and monitoring communications on the network,"" and that the company provided services intended to aid transnational drug trafficking organizations. The company allegedly sold Blackberry phones that had their cameras, microphones, and standard internet and text messaging removed. Instead, the devices came pre-loaded with encrypted email platforms. Phatom used servers based in Panama and Hong Kong in the belief that those countries would be less likely to scrutinize the communications or cooperate with foreign law enforcement authorities. The company also used other techniques to mask their customers' digital footprints. Phantom claimed to be able to remotely wipe any device that fell into the hands of authorities, according to the complaint. The phones cost between $2,000 and $3,000 each for a six-month period. Many of Phantom's clients also used encrypted email addresses associated with narco culture, like ""The.cartelfreedomsecure.me"" and ""Elchapo66lockedpgp.com"" Encrypted email platforms are not illegal, and there are many legitimate reasons people use encryption to protect their electronic messages. Similarly, it isn't necessarily illegal to sell a phone installed with encryption technology. But in this case, authorities say Phantom's entire business model revolved around selling encrypted phones to crime groups. ""Authorities are alleging Ramos' business was part of a conspiracy to sell drugs, based on what he said to undercover agents,"" journalist Joseph Cox told InSight Crime. Previously, many criminals used ""burner phones,"" or cheap, pre-paid cell phones to limit authorities' ability to track their communications. However, crime groups appear to have kept abreast of advances in technology, and are willing to pay for top-of-the-line products like those offered by Phantom. Indeed, Cox uncovered a number of similar operations distributing specialized phones through a network of resellers who advertise through social media accounts. Many of these accounts feature images associated with drug trafficking like guns, drugs and cash. Criminals aren't just buying an encrypted device, Cox said. ""They're buying into the network A Phantom Secure device can only communicate with another Phantom Secure device."" This isn't the first time an encrypted messaging service has come under fire in Latin America for making criminals' messages hard to trace, and other emerging technologies like the dark web have also been known to empower criminal groups operating in the region. The use of legal technologies for illegal purposes raises tough questions for authorities, who have to balance customers' right to privacy with their mandate to prevent and prosecute illegal activities. Going after crime groups is nothing new. But ""what's been missing from the debate is the companies that have been selling these devices to criminal groups,"" Cox said."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"5 Challenges Criminal Economies Pose for Post-Conflict Colombia. A recent investigation by the independent think tank Fundacion Ideas para la Paz (FIP) reveals that while peace negotiations between Colombia's government and rebel group the FARC advance in Cuba, other illegal groups and their sources of financing have already begun to adjust to a post-conflict environment. In the midst of heightening excitement and expectations regarding advances in the negotiations in Havana, which could end with the signing of a peace agreement on March 23, the FIP has published an investigation that warns authorities to adequately prepare its strategy in post-conflict regions following a demobilization of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ). After six months of research and a look back at investigations in past years, the FIP published its report: ""Criminal Economies in Light of the Post-Conflict: Current Trends and Proposals to Address Them."" In its report, FIP states that during ""the development of talks between the Colombian government and the FARC, a new or renewed illegal order is being configured, with multiple illicit economies taking hold in the territories."" In the last three years, coca cultivation has increased, illegal mining has expanded, extortion has become recurrent, and other illegal economies like timber trafficking have been consolidated. This article was originally published by VerdadAbierta.com. It was translated, edited for clarity and reprinted with permission, but does not necessarily reflect the views of InSight Crime. See Spanish version here. The publication warns that ""the power vacuum that the peace process with the FARC could generate is being filled before the signing of the peace agreement, especially in the municipalities in which it shares presence with other guerrilla groups and criminal factions of different sorts. Insurgent groups such as the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) and the Popular Liberation Army (Ejercito Popular Nacional - EPL) have taken advantage of the situation to strengthen themselves and solidify new alliances, while dozens of local criminal groups have organized around existing criminal economies. A new or renewed illegal order is being configured in the midst of the peace process."" A new or renewed illegal order is being configured in the midst of the peace process."" For Eduardo Alvarez, coordinator of Conflict Dynamics for FIP and one of the investigators for the report, criminal groups are more prepared for the post-conflict than the government itself. ""While organized crime is preparing for the post-conflict, the state is having a difficult time organizing and generating holistic responses. We believe that the state continues with an unbalanced approach with a strong repressive component that creates conditions that are not apt for consolidation, the construction of peace, or the implementation of the accords,"" Alvarez told VerdadAbierta.com. For this reason, the FIP advises that once the FARC disarms, the Colombian government should implement a holistic strategy to recuperate territorial control in areas with criminal economies, attacking their roots instead of the weakest links in the criminal structure. ""A repressive strategy focused on dismantling structures has proven insufficient. Sporadic offensives, with operations that enter and leave the area do not change the conditions that allow for criminal activities to be carried out or for illegal groups to control the territory,"" the report emphasizes. For Maria Victoria Llorente, Executive Director of the FIP, territorial control is vital for peace building, and this should not be solely predicated on sending troops to the region and coordinating better with the public prosecutor's office. Instead, it consists in state building in the territories so that something besides criminal economies can prosper. ""The problem is that in what has been made public, we don't see a different focus than what we have had in the past. If we're going to do the same thing, we will have similar results: the organizations will change, maybe they will become less violent, but the conditions in the territory, which make these illegal economies prosper and that hook the populations, will not change,"" she told VerdadAbierta.com. FIP also identified around 200 municipalities in which the FARC has a presence and where the government will have to contend with illegal economies that could be transferred to other criminal groups or insurgents, and/or remain under the control of dissident factions of the FARC. The FIP analyzed five dynamics that have occurred in these contexts since the peace process began in Cuba: 1. Alliances Between Insurgent Groups and Criminal Factions The investigation found that alliances between insurgent groups and criminal factions have been consolidated in recent years, which is reflected in the territorial division of criminal economies, with invisible borders that define who controls towns and municipalities. It also is reflected in the role that each group plays in the criminal economy. As an example of this, the report points to how the different stages of drug production and trafficking have been divided up: ""The FARC maintain the manpower and military capacity to occupy and control the territories where coca, marijuana and poppies are grown. In the meantime, criminal groups have tended to get involved in the processing and commercialization stage. This way, a division of labor is created that facilitates alliances and decreases the risk of confrontation."" The report also notes that: ""Disputes between the FARC and local factions of organized crime are less frequent, which, in some ways, reflects the process of consolidation of the criminal economies. In this context, the actors that are involved in these criminal activities increase profits while avoiding the indiscriminate use of violence and confrontation."" 2. Recycling Insurgency: Transferring Capacities from the FARC to the ELN or EPL This is perhaps one of the most alarming points of the report, because in addition to better coordination between the FARC and ELN, and the territorial expansion of the latter, there are cases of members of the FARC transferring to the ranks of other guerrilla groups. According to testimonies gathered during field work by FIP investigators, FARC guerrillas have supported the ELN in various confrontations with criminal groups in the region of Bajo Cauca, while in Catatumbo, FARC deserters transferred to the EPL. In other regions it is believed that the increase in ELN activities is due to a process of ""changing ranks and transferring capacities"" from the FARC. The report hypothesizes that: ""While the conflict with the FARC could end, the ELN could strengthen its presence in some territories, using the process in Havana to their advantage, especially the cease fire and the recycling of insurgents. In a scenario like this, the threat of guerrillas could stay active and be revitalized in some areas of the country."" The report adds: ""It is a challenge for the FARC to maintain cohesion among their fronts and structures; however, for mid-level commanders and foot soldiers this could be a way to continue with illegal activities. It is important to note that there is not a systematic strategy for re-utilizing insurgents; this is just a cautionary statement regarding possible scenarios in various territories."" 3. Expansion of Drug Trafficking, Mining, and other Criminal Economies Between 2013 and 2014, there was a 44 percent increase in hectares used for coca cultivation, and a 52 percent increase in cocaine production, according to the latest monitoring report from the United Nations. One of the possible reasons for this considered by the FIP has to do with some fronts of the FARC that are ""in a process of accumulation, taking advantage of this window of opportunity that could end with the signing of the peace agreement."" The report adds that marijuana and poppy production has also become important, the former for local consumption and the latter for commercialization of heroin abroad. In terms of illegal mining, although there are not records to verify this, the report notes that the control the FARC and organized crime has on mining activity is not uniform. In some areas they only charge extortion fees, while in others they directly manage legal and illegal activities. ""The scope of this phenomenon has surpassed the specific participation of the insurgency and organized crime; a social order has developed that revolves around the extraction of minerals,"" the report indicates. The report goes on to specify that: ""The extraction of rents is favorable because of high levels of informality (in terms of labor and land ownership, principally) and the state's low capacity to regulate the territories. In a large part of the territories that will enter the post-conflict stage, large sectors of the population receive income from these economies, not only those individuals who participate directly, but also their families."" Another challenge for authorities in a post-conflict environment, in addition to combating illegal resource extraction and environmental damage, is to not criminalize the people who rely on informal mining for survival and have no links to criminal structures. 4. Proliferation of ""Predatory"" Activities, Especially Extortion The report found that extortion provides guerrilla and criminal groups a mechanism to maintain territorial control while also serving as a source of income; in some regions extortion fees are the equivalent of taxes in a formal economy. Extortion has two purposes: the parasitic extraction of resources from victims, and a guarantee of security against retaliations by the perpetrator and actions from the authorities. ""In areas with strong presence of illegal organizations, the majority of legal and illegal activities are taxed. This spans from the small shopkeeper, to motorcycle taxis and business people, to extractive companies with a large reach and state infrastructure projects. Extortion fees are charged differently, based on established quotas linked to the economic capacity of the person being extorted,"" the report states. 5. State Interventions Strengthen Links Between Populations, Criminal Economies On this point, the report questions the government's strategy for confronting criminal economies, which has been based on targeting the weakest links of a criminal structure, motivated by boosting arrest rates and short term results. For the FIP, the impact generated by the arrests of visible figures and high value targets within criminal groups is also reduced because, ""The armed groups have the capacity to restructure and recycle combatants to maintain their territorial influence."" Furthermore, the report states: ""From the point of view of the communities, while criminal factions change their name and leadership, the conditions of vulnerability stay the same. The illegal economy continues to be the center of social relations and power, despite incursions by police and the army."" The report also indicates that the repressive actions of the state can even be counterproductive and strengthen links that the communities have with illicit activities and illegal organizations. For this reason, the FIP claims that the challenge for the state is not only to disband local factions with the capacity to use violence and corruption, but rather build a new relationship between communities and formal institutions, that permit them to reestablish their legitimate authority. The report concludes that: ""In operative terms, the state is facing three main problems: lack of coordination, inappropriate interventions and lack of capacity to consolidate its presence in the territories, beyond sporadic operations by authorities. The existence of the armed conflict, the challenge of organized crime, and the situations of violence have generated a confusion in roles, priorities, and functions of the police and the military. This is exacerbated by the lack of a real crime-fighting policy that orients the use of State force, guarantees the effectiveness of punishments, and responds proportionally to the seriousness of crimes. ""The spotlight has been more on criminal organizations and less on the territories, which has resulted in repressive action with diminishing success and the consolidation of criminal economies in different areas of the country."" *This article was originally published by VerdadAbierta.com.

"Haitis Revived Military Could Pose More Security Risks Than Solutions. Haiti is reconstituing its previously disbanded army after more than two decades, amid concerns about growing insecurity as a United Nations peacekeeping force is set to withdraw later this year. And while politicians have justified the move as a step toward combating contraband trafficking, the real motivations behind the decision may be political. The recruitment effort for the new army was announced by the Defense Ministry in early July and has seen more than 2,200 candidates sign up in the first round, reported Haiti Libre. Due to budget constraints, the force will have fewer than 500 members. Defense Minister Herve Denis said the army's mission would be to fight against contraband smuggling and provide relief in case of natural disasters, according to the Miami Herald. The minister argued that the cost of the force will be outweighed by its impact on smuggling from the Dominican Republic, which he estimated causes lost tax revenues for Haiti of between $200 million and $500 million per year. However, critics have said that the recruitment process has lacked transparency and has been conducted in the absence of a command structure for the force, reported AlterPresse. Others have questioned the logic of investing in an army instead of dedicating increased resources to Haiti's 15,000-strong National Police. An August 2016 report by the UN Secretary General noted significant shortcomings in planned improvements to the force, including ramping up its border control capabilities. Several experts consulted by InSight Crime raised concerns about the potential efficacy of the army in terms of the proposed anti-contraband efforts, while pointing to possible political motivations for re-establishing the force. And all warned of the risk that the violent and abusive history of Haiti's military repeat itself. ""Sending a poorly-trained, underpaid military to the border to confront a massive corruption scheme appears destined for failure,"" said Jake Johnston, a research associate at the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) who has done extensive research and reporting on Haiti. Indeed, an inadequate fiscal framework and corruption within an inefficient customs agency are the two primary drivers of contraband along the border -- not the lack of a military presence. ""The push to restore the military is not a rational one based on Haiti's needs, but an ideological one,"" he told InSight Crime. ""This is a party with close connections to the old Duvalierist and militarist clique that had ruled Haiti for decades and whose power and influence was threatened by previous governments. It would be difficult for the government to turn its back on its source of power now that it is in office,"" the CEPR researcher said, referring to the governments of Francois ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude, also known as ""Baby Doc."" The authoritarian political dynasty, which lasted from the 1950s to the 1980s, was associated with the use of armed forces as a tool of political repression -- a fact that contributed to the decision of then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to disband the army in 1995. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Haiti Johnston's comments echoed those of Brian Concannon , the executive director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti advocacy organization. ""I have seen nothing that would indicate that the army would do a better job of policing the borders or responding to natural disasters than civilian police,"" Concannon said. He added that other examples of militarized security initiatives across the Americas suggest a better course of action may be to strengthen the civilian police rather than create a new, military institution. ""That is especially true considering the Haitian army's history of corruption and professional misconduct,"" the human rights advocate told InSight Crime. Concannon also pointed to political motives at play, arguing the army would help the government ""exert control over its political opponents,"" evidenced by ""the initial army proposal of [former] President [Michel] Martelly that specifically included spying on journalists and others, to the current efforts to recruit soldiers before there is even much structure."" Interestingly, both Concannon and Johnston noted underlying socioeconomic factors behind the public's support for the army and the seemingly widespread interest in the recruitment effort. ""This has gained some additional traction because of the high level of youth unemployment, where any opportunity for steady pay is welcome. Also, given the high proportion of Haiti's population which is quite young, many lack the historical experience that others have of the Haitian military and its repressive actions,"" Johnston explained. ""People are signing up because they are desperate for jobs and meaning,"" Concannon added, and warned that ""once [members of the new army] have the position, they will do what they need to do to preserve that status."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"US Treasury Blacklists Guatemalan Trafficker Working for Zetas. The US Treasury Department has added an alleged Guatemalan drug trafficker and ally of Mexico's Zetas to its kingpin list, in a case that highlights the strong connections between Guatemalan organized crime and Mexican cartels. Jairo Estuardo Orellana Morales, alias ""El Pelon,"" was labelled a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker under the US Kingpin Act. In addition to cocaine trafficking, Orellana has been linked to a number of drug trafficking-related murders in Guatemala, and officials stated that he ""employs extreme violence"" in his operations. Orellana also has links to the Lorenzana crime family, specifically Marta Julia Lorenzana Cordon, with whom he had a child, and who was sanctioned under the same act in November 2012. According to the Treasury chart (see map below), Orellana uses three principal routes to traffic cocaine into Mexico, all originating in Guatemala's Zacapa department near the eastern border with Honduras, and moving up through the northern and western Peten, Quiche and Huehuetenango departments, respectively. The Zetas have established a firm territorial presence throughout Guatemala, and as of 2011, Orellana was believed to be in charge of their operations in the Zacapa department. His role appears to go significantly beyond serving as a local drug transporter -- as is commonly the case with local traffickers working for Mexican cartels in Central America's Northern Triangle countries. Orellana reportedly participated in the Zetas takeover of the Peten department in 2011, and was one of two people identified by prosecutors as ordering the massacre of 27 farmworkers in the department. Orellana has also directed ""tumbes"" -- the theft of cocaine shipments from rival groups -- in both Guatemala and neighboring Honduras. Earlier this year, he was targeted for assassination after allegedly stealing 1.5 tons of cocaine linked to Zetas' rivals the Sinaloa Cartel. Orellana's links to the Lorenzanas, local drug transporters who have received a number of blows in recent years, are consistent with his Zetas connections. Although the Lorenzanas initially worked with the Sinaloa Cartel, the Zetas are believed to have now built alliances with key members of the fractured clan."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Haiti Police, Senator Implicated in US Arms Trafficking Case. A Florida gun shop owner was recently convicted for trafficking firearms to Haiti with the help of a senator and several other top government officials, raising questions about government corruption in the Caribbean nation's illegal arms trade. Gun shop owner Junior Joseph was found guilty of conspiring with a Haitian senator and other individuals to illegally traffic 166 semi-automatic firearms and 30,000 rounds of ammunition hidden in the back of a truck shipped to Haiti in August 2016, the Miami Herald reported. In early August 2016, prosecutors say that Joseph delivered the Mitsubishi truck containing ""household goods, an unlocked safe, ammunition, 159 shotguns, five AR-15 rifles"" and other semi-automatic weapons to a shipping company in Port of Palm Beach, Florida, according to the indictment. Days later, Joseph allegedly sent copies of the shipping information regarding the weapons stash hidden inside the truck to Haitian Senator Herve Fourcand and one of his associates. In one of the messages intercepted by prosecutors, Joseph tells another individual in Haiti that he ""would like to get help"" to ""remove a truck from customs,"" adding that the help should be ""inspection free."" The contact in Haiti said they should be able to ""clear it without any problem."" However, Joseph later received a message from this same associate in September 2016 advising him that ""everything went south today, the car was confiscated and the police know what they are going to do,"" the indictment states. The truck had reached the western port of St. Marc in Artibonite department, outside of the capital Port-au-Prince. The cache of illegal weapons was found during a routine inspection. Joseph also allegedly exchanged messages with Senator Fourcand's brother, Edouard ""Dollar,"" the ""pseudonym of a close associate of the country's recently replaced police chief [Godson Orelus] who has been jailed on weapons charges in Haiti in connection with the smuggled shipment,"" according to the Miami Herald. Fourcand was not charged in the criminal case, but his name and that of former police chief Orelus were ""prominently mentioned"" throughout the US trial. A Haitian judge charged eight others, including the former police chief and several officials, with crimes ranging from illicit firearms and ammunition trafficking to money laundering, according to the Miami Herald. Junior's brother, Jimy, is also facing charges in connection to the case. Lawyers for both brothers declined InSight Crime's request for comment. The arms trafficking cases unfolding in the United States and Haiti highlight the amount of illegal weapons flooding the Caribbean nation despite the United States' arms embargo against it , and the role that political elites play in facilitating the safe passage of such arms. Junior Joseph applied for licenses through the US State and Commerce departments for authorization to ""engage in training and support activities for private security contractors"" approved by Haiti's National Police and Interior Ministry, according to court documents. He was first granted a license by the US Commerce Department, which controls the importation of shotguns into Haiti, in April 2016. This authorized him to import guns, shells, bulletproof vests, and other items to his Global Dynasty Corp. S.A. in Haiti, a subsidiary of his eponymous US company. However, the Commerce Department later revoked the license, saying the exports were ""no longer deemed to be in the foreign policy interests of the United States,"" according to court documents. Joseph was officially notified of this in May 2016. Shortly after being made aware that his license had been revoked, emails show Joseph discussing the importation of bulletproof vests into Haiti. Among the documents Joseph cited as authorizing the shipment was a ""weapons import certificate"" signed by the recently jailed former Police Chief Orelus, according to the Miami Herald. However, under the US arms embargo, any firearms sent into Haiti must go through the US State Department. An analyst with the State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) said during Junior Joseph's trial that when officials contacted the US Embassy in Port-au-Prince, ""Haiti's National Police and government denied they had any contract with Global Dynasty Corp,"" the Miami Herald reported. A 2016 Haiti National Police investigation, according to the Miami Herald, found that Global Dynasty, S.A. in Haiti ""only existed on paper."" What's more, the company was never even listed as the receiver of the arms. As part of the investigation into the illegal firearms shipment, it was discovered that one of Joseph's cousins who helped him ship the truck from Florida to Haiti had ""listed himself as the shipper and receiver,"" according to the Miami Herald. The implication is that Global Dynasty may have been taking purchase orders for weapons and then shipping these weapons to third parties in Haiti and not the police, the alleged intended recipient. Politicians in Haiti have long been accused of helping direct firearms into the country to arm gangs and politically connected militias in exchange for their backing and support. Still, it's unclear who was ultimately going to receive the weapons shipped from the United State and into Haiti with the help of Senator Fourcand. That said, the location of the seized weapons in Haiti may offer some clues. The port of St. Marc is in Artibonite department where Senator Youri Latortue was in power for many years. In the past, colleagues and other sources have accused Latortue of being the ""most brazenly corrupt of leading Haitian politicians"" and a ""drug dealer,"" in addition to ""distributing weapons in an effort to destabilize the government,"" according to a November 2006 WikiLeaks cable. The cable says Latortue's ""close associations with armed gangs and drug traffickers"" contributes to his ability to ""manipulate the region."" Latortue's name has not yet been mentioned at all. Both he and Fourcand also have not been arrested or charged with any crimes in Haiti or the United States. With the trial of Junior Joseph's brother, Jimy, set to begin this week in the United States, it is possible other high-ranking Haitian officials may be implicated."	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
Guatemala Arms Trafficking Routes Mirror Drug Trafficking Hot Spots. A new report has provided additional information on arms trafficking routes in Guatemala, showing that they appear to mirror the drug trafficking hot spots utilized by the country's criminal groups. Between July and September, Guatemala's National Police (Policia Nacional Civil - PNC) carried out a series of operations to identify organized crime groups and arms trafficking routes, elPeriodico reported. The three-month operation saw authorities seize explosive materials and several high-powered rifles , among other contraband. According to authorities in charge of the operations, the two departments that saw the largest number of firearms seized were Guatemala's northernmost Peten department and southern Escuintla department along the country's Pacific coast. (Graphic c/o elPeriodico ) The concentration of seizures in these two areas is due to their strategic location and ability to connect to the rest of the country, according to Guatemala's Weapons and Explosives Investigation and Deactivation Division (Division de Investigacion y Desactivacion de Armas y Explosivos - DIDAE). Many of the trafficking routes identified by authorities funneled into Guatemala City, the capital and largest metropolitan area. National police official Stu Velasco told elPeriodico that the areas of Zona 18 to the north of the capital and Villa Nueva to the south were two of the most impacted by the operations. Somewhat unsurprisingly, the new data suggests that the guns in Guatemala tend to go mostly to where the country's criminal groups operate. Pacific routes have grown in importance lately as Atlantic trafficking routes originating in Colombia are becoming increasingly targeted by authorities. Escuintla is an ideal place for trafficking, and criminal groups have long battled for control over the coastal province due to its proximity to the capital and it being home to the country's largest Pacific port, Puerto Quetzal. And Peten, on the border with Mexico, is an important overland trafficking hub as much of the cocaine destined for the United States passes through this region. Indeed, the arms trafficking routes identified by authorities correspond with areas some of Guatemala's most notorious criminal families formerly concentrated their criminal operations. For example, the Mendozas, who smuggled contraband before becoming one of Central America's major drug trafficking organizations, had their base of operations in Peten before losing much of their territory to Mexico's Zetas. The link between arms trafficking and the drug trade may seem obvious, but it is important for authorities to understand and address, as guns remain a driving force behind violence in Latin America. As InSight Crime reported in an April investigation , most of the murders in Guatemala between 2014 and 2015 were committed with firearms.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"El Salvador Gangs Wielding More Weapons of War. The government of El Salvador's militarized campaign against the country's street gangs has been met by an increasingly heavily armed reaction. El Faro's investigation indicates that the gangs' growing use of assault rifles is an echo of the civil war that ended almost 25 years ago. ""Our presumption is that many are from the civil war,"" responds Mauricio Ramirez Landaverde, the Minister of Public Security, when questioned on the origin of the weapons that Salvadoran officials seize from the gangs with increasing frequency. The minister's response refers to all firearms in general -- shotguns, pistols, revolvers, etc. -- but applies to one type of weapon in particular: assault rifles. Salvadoran law classifies these automatic weapons -- primarily US M-16s and Russian AK-47s -- as ""weapons of war,"" and their possession by the general public is strictly prohibited. *This article was translated, edited for clarity and length and published with the permission of El Faro. It does not necessarily represent the views of InSight Crime. See the Spanish original here. Between 2011 and 2014, the National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil - PNC) confiscated, on average, a rifle each week. Through the first five months of 2016, however, this average rose to one every three days. And these are just the official figures, meaning they do not include weapons that security forces confiscate from criminals but do not report. ""When the war was only with the other gang, it was better to have a pistol or revolver, because those are easier to hide,"" says a veteran member of the Barrio 18 gang over the sound of gunshots in the neighborhoods of Salado. ""And now? Now we are fighting a war against the government, and it is better to have more powerful weapons because we know the police are coming to kill us."" The war between the state and the gangs was tacitly declared in January 2015 , when President Salvador Sanchez Ceren, a former guerrilla commander, closed any options for dialogue and opted for armed repression. ""Some say we're at war, but there is no other way. They are criminals, and should be treated as such,"" Sanchez Ceren declared in March 2016. During wartime, weapons of war are used. Until 2014, the PNC reported annual seizures of approximately 50 to 60 assault weapons, the vast majority confiscated from gangs. In 2015, that figure jumped to 92. And if the pace of the first few months of 2016 holds, the year will finish with around 125 seizures of such weapons. The gangs increasingly prize assault files. According to a gang member who served as a witness for the Attorney General during the ""Opicio Massacre"" case, in April 2016 the Barrio 18 Revolucionarios in Quezaltepeque had eight M-16s and three AK-47s. That's at least 11 assault rifles for a small gang faction operating in just two municipalities. ""The arms market is like that for tomatoes. The price goes up and down depending on demand and supply. Sometimes there is a shortage, as with drugs, which is when the price rises,"" Shadow, a veteran gang member, says ironically about the current situation. The historical paradox is that the same M-16s and AK-47s now being fired by gang members may have been wielded by fighters of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Marti de Liberacion Nacional - FMLN) three decades ago. The FMLN is today the political party in power that is fighting the gangs. FMLN rebels train with M-16s in 1983 that have been left in Vietnam by US. Photo c/o Giovanni Palazzo/MUPI Jose Miguel Cruz -- director of the Institute of Public Opinion (Instituto Universitario de Opinion Publica - IUDOP) at the Universidad Centroamericana Jose Simeon Canas (UCA) from 1994 to 2006, and current director of research at Florida International University -- has invested the most time studying the proliferation of weapons following the war and the phenomenon of the gangs. When asked if he thinks the same weapons used by guerrillas a quarter century ago are today in the hands of gang members, Cruz answered, ""No doubt, some are."" The nature of the phenomenon makes it imposible to know the exact number of gang rifles that were once carried by guerrillas, soldiers or members of death squads, but the most recognized experts agree that it is somewhat common. Minister Ramirez Landaverde's assertion that ""we presume that many are from the armed conflict"" carries significant weight given his position overseeing the police, who are in charge of confiscating and analyzing gang weapons. ""The type of weapons, the caliber and individual characteristics make us believe that they are from the war."" Defense Minister David Munguia Payes agreed. ""We have noticed in recent months that the criminal groups have increased their weaponry, and that is because there are a lot of weapons left over from the armed conflict of the 1980s,"" the general said. Cruz, who co-authored a book on firearms in El Salvador, said the country's black market for weapons is ""very vigorous"" as a result of ""the current war between the government and the gangs, and some of those guns come from our old armed conflict."" He added that some mid-level commanders sold weapons on the black market after the war and some individual combatants kept their rifles and have been selling them off with the passage of time. ""Nobody knows for certain how many weapons ended up in civilian hands after the war, because the institutional efforts to collect them did not work. They were totally flawed,"" Cruz wrote in his book. Sixteen years later, Cruz reiterated that opinion. ""In El Salvador, there was never a concerted effort to collect the weapons of the war,"" he said. Members of the different gangs confirmed that assault weapons are more sought after since the government delared war on them. They also say that many of their weapons date back to the 12-year civil war, which ended in 1992. An M-16/A1, a noted older model, can be purchased on the black market for $1,500. An original M-16/A2 in optimal condition can cost up to $2,500. An AK-47, a very versatile and lethal weapon, costs about $1,700, a relatively inexpensive price due to its use of 7.62 mm ammunition, which more scarce and expensive than the 5.56 mm founds fired by the M-16. Gang members get weapons left over from the armed conflict in a number of ways: conventional arms traffickers with ready inventories; a former guerrilla fighter who was put in charge of guarding a weapons cache during the war and decides it is time to sell them to the highest bidder; members of the police and military who steal confiscated weapons during the different links in the chain of custody, selling them back into the black market; or the gang member who is the son of a former combatant and brings the family weapon to the gang. Nevertheless, the ministries of Security and Defense also say gangs have rifles that were not in the country during the war. These weapons come from Central America's robust black market for arms and generally supply organized crime groups. Some were taken from the armed forces after the war, and others are stolen or bought from individuals and security companies that are licensed to legally purchase them. Ana Guadalupe Martinez, known as FMLN commander Maria during the war, acknowledged the possibility that rebel assault rifles have made their way onto the black market. ""More than one guerrilla kept their weapons for personal use. Other organizations might not have turned in everything,"" Martinez said. ""It also happened that people who were in charge of guarding caches died, and those arsenals remain hidden until a farmer or someone else finds them."" The guerrillas started to get their hands on large numbers of M-16s beginning in 1983 and 1984. The assault rifles formerly belonged to the US army and were abandoned in Vietnam when the United States withdrew. In terms of AK-47s, the varied models seen in El Salvador were imported towards the end of the war, after 1987. AK-47 assault rifles confiscated from gang members by the PNC. Some of the assault rifles being used by gang members can be traced back to the Salvadoran armed forces, according to congressman Rodrigo Avila Avilez, a former head of the National Civil Police and one of the country's foremost weapons experts. ""Weapons of the armed forces also ended up in the hands of criminals, of private citizens, especially at the beginning of the war when control over inventories were less strict,"" Avila Avilez said. ""But those guns are very few compared to the number the guerrillas were able to store in a clandestine manner."" Avila Avilez said there are four reasons why the gangs have so many weapons of war. For one, the FMLN hid some of its weapons in case the peace process did not pan out, and those guns eventually made their way onto the black market. Another reason is that middle- and high-ranking commanders of both the armed forces and the guerrillas kept their guns to make money off of them. A third reason is the underground weapons caches that were kept secret from all but a few individuals. And lastly, there were excombatants who held on to a weapon or two as souvenirs of the war. *This article was translated, edited for clarity and length and published with the permission of El Faro.

"The Impact of Obamas Gun Control Proposal in Mexico. President Obama's push to enact stronger gun control measures answers a long-held wish from Mexican officials, but how likely is it to change the security dynamic south of the Rio Grande? President Obama announced a new push to pass legislation limiting access to deadly weapons last week, adding, ""I will put everything I've got into this."" The proposal encompasses 23 executive orders, three of which Obama has already signed and went into effect immediately: an end to the moratorium on federal research related to gun violence, a mandate for federal agencies to recover and trace weapons encountered over the course of their investigations, and a mandate to comply with a 2007 act that requires agencies to update a federal database regarding the mental health of individuals. He also proposed various legislative changes: a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004, a ban on magazines that contain more than 10 bullets, mandatory criminal background checks for sales at gun shows, a crackdwn on the straw buyers who purchase guns for Mexican gangs, and a prohibition on armor-piercing rounds. While the increased interest in gun control from the White House stems largely from American tragedies like the Newtown, Conn., mass shooting in December, Obama's pledges also address a perennial concern of Mexican policy makers. While US officials have often acknowledged their country's role as a driver of the insecurity in Mexico, this is the first time that they have backed up the rhetoric with attempts to significantly alter domestic policy. The belief behind the Mexican complaints is that the easy purchase of firearms in the US is a major driver of Mexican violence. More specifically, as former President Calderon argued in an appearance before Congress in 2010, the 2004 expiration of the assault weapons ban has flooded Mexico with AR-15s and other weapons capable of mass mayhem. In the hands of groups like the Zetas , those guns have killed tens of thousands of people in Mexico and sparked a doubling of the murder rate under Calderon. Insight Crime Analysis While the exact role of US guns in Mexican violence remains a matter of passionate debate, there is certainly evidence to support the complaints. Between 2007 and 2011, Mexico sent roughly 99,000 guns to the US for tracing; the ATF reported that 70 percent, or 68,000, were purchased in the US. Reports of AR-15s being used in Mexican crimes are commonplace, and arrested criminals have discussed their reliance on the US as a source of guns. More detailed analysis supports the broader conclusions hinted at above. In 2010, Diego Valle-Jones , a specialist in statistical analysis, took a long look at the impact of the assault weapons ban in Nuevo Laredo and Tamaulipas, concluding that ""the expiration of the Assault Weapon Ban contributed to the violence in Nuevo Laredo with possible spillover effects in Nuevo Leon."" However, that doesn't mean Obama's announcement will reverse the tide of violence. The most obvious obstacle is political: Obama's announcement won headlines around the country, but his proposal remains a long way from approval, and he faces dogged opposition from the NRA and the group's Congressional allies. The shooting at Sandy Hook may indeed prove a sea change in the way the US views gun control, but it's certainly not a foregone conclusion, and it's worth noting that gun rights advocates have had the better of the debate for close to 20 years. Moreover, even conceding the importance of the US gun market to the recent wave of killings in Mexico (a finding that other studies have pushed back against), the imposition of the new controls proposed by Obama doesn't mean that Mexico will experience a corresponding pacification. Unfortunately, the US gun trade is not a condition for Mexican violence, but rather an enabler of it, and a replaceable one at that. To take but one example, the persistent violence in Venezuela demonstrates that access to American gun shops is not a requirement for jolts of criminal bloodshed. Furthermore, Mexico's foremost criminal groups are sufficiently wealthy and internationally connected that they surely have contacts among international arms dealers; for groups like the Sinaloa Cartel , if it's not AR-15s from Arizona, it'll be AK-47s from Azerbaijan. What increased controls and an assault weapons ban would likely do is raise the cost of black market firearms, so that some smaller gangs might be forced to abandon the use of guns. Since smaller gangs have been a substantial driver of violence, this alone would make the move worthwhile for Mexico. But it would be a largely marginal improvement, and it is wrong to expect a radically new landscape in Mexico on the basis of Obama's declaration."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Will Targeting CJNG Finances Help Mexico Break Powerful Crime Group?Authorities in Mexico are seeking to attack the finances of the country's most powerful organized crime groups, but questions remain as to whether the incoming administration has the institutional capacity and coordination to do so. Santiago Nieto, the head of the financial intelligence unit within Mexico's Finance Ministry (Secretaria de Hacienda y Credito Publico - SHCP), said that his office filed a complaint against three businesses and seven people linked to the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion - CJNG) that have already been blacklisted by the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), Reuters reported December 7. This comes after the Finance Ministry announced on December 5 that it had filed its first complaint with prosecutors to initiate judicial proceedings against organized crime members for money laundering. The US Embassy in Mexico said they ""welcomed increased collaboration"" with authorities in Mexico, according to Reuters. Both countries are offering multimillion-dollar rewards for information leading to the capture of the CJNG's leader, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes , alias ""El Mencho."" In October 2018, several US agencies announced new ""coordinated enforcement efforts"" to ""target and dismantle"" the CJNG. Prosecutors in Mexico under former President Enrique Pena Nieto proved woefully incapable of investigating and prosecuting members of the CJNG -- one of Mexico's most powerful criminal organizations -- fostering, in part, the group's rapid rise. It remains to be seen if the administration of newly inaugurated President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will be more capable of taking on the group. While Mexico has the institutional and legal framework to tackle money laundering, a low conviction rate suggests there is a ""low degree of effectiveness"" in how these cases are handled. This, combined with corruption at the state level, ""undermines their capacity to investigate and prosecute serious offenses,"" according to a January 2018 evaluation of Mexico's anti-money laundering measures from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global organization that sets standards for combating money laundering. In September of this year, for example, El Mencho's wife, Rosalinda Gonzalez Valencia -- who allegedly helps handle the CJNG's finances -- was released on bail just three months after she was arrested on organized crime and money laundering charges. Complicating matters, tensions also appear to be rising between Lopez Obrador and the judiciary over proposed budget cuts. The president wants to reduce the salaries of prosecutors while asking them to do more. Lopez Obrador called those fighting for their pay ""dishonest and insensitive,"" adding that they don't understand the ""new reality."" The money laundering prosecutions, however, could have an impact if implemented effectively. The CJNG has already suffered from authorities' increased attention and is ""worse off"" than a few years ago, according to Jaime Lopez, a security policy consultant and former Mexican police official. Indeed, authorities have in recent years arrested several members of the Gonzalez Valencia family -- who are thought to head Los Cuinis, the CJNG's money laundering wing. The US Treasury Department has also successfully seized a wide range of the cartel's assets. In addition, internal fighting has caused the CJNG to splinter , effectively jeopardizing its power in key criminal regions. Prosecutors' ability to track and seize laundered money and other assets is crucial to combating organized crime. Whether authorities in Mexico have the will and ability to do so, Lopez told InSight Crime, remains uncertain. ""Combating money laundering is notoriously complex,"" he said, ""but the instruments are there, and the capabilities exist."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Brazil Construction Giant Admits to Massive Bribe Scheme. Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht and its affiliate Braskem agreed to pay $3.5 billion in fines after pleading guilty to bribery charges, revealing the magnitude of the international scheme as well as the United States' growing involvement in prosecuting international corruption. The joint investigation by authorities in Brazil, the United States and Switzerland unveiled a ""massive and unparalleled bribery and bid-rigging scheme"" initiated in 2001 that was institutionalized within the company over the years, according to a December 21, US Justice Department press release. US Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sung-Hee Suh said that ""Odebrecht and Braskem used a hidden but fully functioning Odebrecht business unit -- a 'Department of Bribery,' so to speak -- that systematically paid hundreds of millions of dollars to corrupt government officials in countries on three continents."" The bribery unit grew such that it was officially baptized the ""Division of Structured Operations"" by 2006, and reported directly to the conglomerate's top executives. By the pleading parties' own admission, this unit transferred approximately $788 million to government officials and political parties in twelve countries in return for public contracts, favorable legislation and preferential prices on acquired material, according to the criminal information document that charged the Odebrecht conglomerate. According to the US Justice Department, the bribery unit ""utilized an entirely separate and off-book communications system, which allowed members of the Division of Structured Operations to communicate with one another and with outside financial operators and other co-conspirators about the bribes via secure emails and instant messages, using codenames and passwords."" No instances of corrupt US officials have been raised in the case, but the unit used US bank accounts at times to transfer the illegal funds. Prosecutors used this fact to establish the US courts' claim of jurisdiction in a case involving foreign companies and officials. Odebrecht agreed that an appropriate fine would be $4.5 billion, an amount Bloomberg described as ""the largest corruption penalty ever levied by global authorities."" However, the company argued that it was only able to pay $2.6 billion. The final amount the company will pay will be decided at an April court hearing. Eighty percent of the penalty will be paid to Brazil and the remaining 20 percent will be equally divided between Switzerland and the United States. For its part, Braskem has agreed to pay around $1 billion, of which 70 percent will go to Brazil, while the two other countries will obtain 15 percent each. These latest revelations linked to the ongoing Petrobras scandal indicate that corruption at Odebrecht was not only widespread, but institutionalized as part of the company's operations. This shows how ingrained the practice of bribery was at the company, and also how commonplace corruption of this kind is throughout Latin America. Apparently, Odebrecht decided that creating a criminal structure to buy friendly treatment from officials was more efficient than trying to compete with other firms without greasing the wheels of bureaucracy through corruption. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Money Laundering This case also highlights the United States' deepening involvement in prosecuting international cases of corruption with only a tenuous nexus to the United States itself. This dynamic was previously illustrated by the FIFA corruption scandal , the investigation into the state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PdVSA), and the various probes into the ties between Honduran elites and organized crime."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"The Guatemalan Trafficker Who Confessed to the DEA. Marllory Chacon Rossell pleaded guilty on December 12, 2014 to drug trafficking charges in Miami, but she had been collaborating with the DEA and the US Attorney's Office in Florida since 2012. It remains to be seen who she has named and if this act of contrition will reduce her sentence. The Guatemalan drug trafficker Marllory Dadiana Chacon Rossell is in purgatory. No one knows yet if she is in the waiting room for heaven or for hell. She could be given a light sentence, or she could spend up to four decades in prison. At 43 years old, the possibility that Chacon will grow old behind bars is in play. The fact that Chacon handed herself over to US authorities on September 10, 2014 and that she pleaded guilty to drug trafficking in a Miami court last December means she has betrayed important accomplices. In fact, her court file, number 11-20582-CR-MARTINEZ, reveals that she has communicated with US authorities since 2012. In March of this year, the file revealed that Chacon will be sentenced on May 5. That day will define her future. This article originally appeared in Plaza Publica and was translated, edited, and reprinted with permission. See Spanish original here. In January 2012, the US Treasury Department reported that Chacon had worked as a supplier for various Mexican drug cartels. The Treasury classified her as ""the most active money launderer in Guatemala,"" and one of the most prolific drug traffickers in all of Central America. In addition, the Treasury identified Chacon's husband as an accomplice, along with the Honduran Jorge Fernandez Carbajal; the Colombian Cesar Barrera, alias ""Nigua""; and the Guatemalan Hayron Borrayo Lasmibat along with his wife, Mirza Hernandez. Several local media outlets have revealed alleged links between Chacon and Borrayo and President Otto Perez Molina and Vice President Roxana Baldetti. There are even accusations the drug traffickers gave $2 million dollars to the political party Partido Patriota in 2011 for campaigns. Baldetti has denied meeting Chacon, and Chacon has insisted she met the Vice President, but that the two maintain no relationship. Headquarters of the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida In 2012, Guatemala's Attorney General's Office announced that it had not found any evidence against Chacon, and the National Civil Police (PNC) confirmed that they were not investigating her. Nevertheless, the US Department of Justice referred to her as a ""fugitive."" In 2015, after Chacon had pleaded guilty, Guatemala's Interior Minister, Mauricio Lopez Bonilla, said there were in fact several cases open against her for drug trafficking, but gave no further details. In June 2012, one of Chacon's accomplices, the Colombian Cesar Barrera, told the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that he wanted to ""amply"" collaborate with authorities. Public court documents do not reveal if he implicated Chacon, or if his collaboration facilitated the September 2012 capture of drug trafficker Daniel ""El Loco"" Barrera in Venezuela. Authorities described ""El Loco"" Barrera, an associate of another one of Chacon's accomplices, as one of Colombia's biggest drug capos. The DEA's Trailing of Chacon Chacon coordinated the receipt, purchase, transport, and distribution of multiple tons of cocaine headed for the United States. The DEA began following Chacon in November 2008, and began investigating her after receiving information about her from various informants. These include incarcerated drug traffickers who cooperated with US authorities and also helped locate Chacon's co-conspirators in Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico, among other countries. A confidential source told the US Attorney's Office in Florida that between 2008 and 2009, Chacon orchestrated the receipt of two cocaine shipments of 1,200 kilos from Honduras. One group, identified as ""the Caracoles,"" transported the drugs to Guatemala, ""to be later distributed to a Mexican cartel."" The document stated that while the confidential source was working with Chacon, she laundered $4 million dollars in drug proceeds in Guatemala and Panama. The Caracoles do not appear in the US Justice Department's public archive, nor in US State Department cables between 2008 and 2010 published by Wikileaks. But it is believed the group operated along Honduras' northern coast, where Hondurans call residents of African descent with English or other European roots ""caracoles"" (snails). Borrayo and Cesar Barrera appear in the court document 11-20512-Criminal-King, a distinct accusation from that against Chacon, from a court in the Southern District of Florida. Nevertheless, they had both been designated by the US Treasury, and shared a similar modus operandi. Between 2008 and 2009, Cesar Barrera was the representative of a drug trafficking organization in Colombia. According to his lawyer, Jay Allen White, he did not transport or negotiate the price of drugs. But, according to the US Attorney's Office in Florida, Cesar Barrera was ""the eyes and ears"" for his Colombian bosses in Guatemala and Mexico. He supervised the reception of drug shipments sent from Venezuela via Honduras, and their distribution to Mexican drug cartel the Zetas (who the US has linked to Chacon). Court document describing the role of Colombian trafficker Cesar Barrera ""Cesar Barrera's role required him to meet very high-level people face-to-face,"" prosecutor Monique Botero said at a hearing (according to court documents). ""He spoke with Guatemalan and Mexican drug traffickers, to assure them that the cocaine would arrive, and ensure that they were satisfied with the deal."" Two of those traffickers were Borrayo and Chacon. Cesar Barrera played his intermediary role until, in May 2009, his bosses sent less cocaine to the Zetas than was agreed upon. The Zetas kidnapped Barrera near the Guatemala-Mexico border, in order to kill him. He escaped, although he was shot in the head and in the back after a confrontation between his kidnappers and the Mexican soldiers who liberated him. Barrera fled to Colombia, where he announced years later that he would hand himself over to the DEA. But his leaving Guatemala did not stop Borrayo and Chacon's drug trafficking operations. A confidential source and former associate of Chacon -- registered in the court document as CS-2 -- told the US Attorney's Office that he or she was involved in three aerial drug shipments. The source revealed that Chacon organized the arrival of the drugs in Honduras, and owned a part of the shipment, 300 kilos worth. The last drug shipment CS-2 participated in was in November 2010. The document stated that while the source was working with Chacon, she laundered $4 million dollars in drug proceeds in Guatemala and Panama. At the end of 2010, another former member of Chacon's inner circle began cooperating with the US Attorney's Office. This ""confidential informant"" arrived at one of Chacon's residences in Guatemala with the Colombian Orlando Fernandez Barrero (partner to ""El Loco"" Barrera), and filmed the meeting between the three of them. The video revealed that Chacon was not just a link in the chain, but was responsible for important operational details. The informant, or ""CS-1,"" filmed Fernandez asking Chacon to ""provide her trafficking infrastructure in Honduras for the receipt of an 800 kilo cocaine shipment."" According to the court document, the video shows Chacon coordinating the arrival of the drug shipment with two cellphones. In one phone call, she gives instructions about the landing strip that should be used, and how much fuel would be needed. She ordered that trafficking group the Caracoles receive the shipment on her behalf, in two day's time. Chacon also said that ""she had purchased a Cessna Caravan plane capable of transporting approximately 2 tons of cocaine."" During the same meeting, the informant and Chacon discussed how many kilos she would receive and how much it would cost ""so she could be ready to pay in full."" Chacon later coordinated the shipment from Honduras to Guatemala. The US Attorney's Office used CS-2's revelations to open an investigation and formally accuse the Colombian Fernandez Barrero and his brother, Javier. Both frequently traveled to Central America. The accusations against Chacon stemmed from her relationship with the Fernandez brothers, who handed themselves over to US authorities at the end of 2010. Accusations Written with the Ink of Treason On August 25, 2011, the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida formally accused Chacon of conspiring to traffic at least five kilos of cocaine. On that day, judge Stephen Brown ordered the indictment to be sealed, until Chacon was captured or the court dictated otherwise. In January 2012, the US Treasury made the drug trafficking accusations against Chacon public for the first time. In July 2012, a federal judge in the United States sentenced the brothers Orlando and Javier Fernandez Barrero to 11 and 13 years in prison, respectively. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Orlando is incarcerated in a medium-security prison in South Carolina. His brother Javier is in a minimum-security prison in Texas. Both sentences could foreshadow what awaits Chacon, since the accusation against the brothers supported the accusation against her. In August 2012, the Treasury Department applied further sanctions against Chacon. The Treasury reiterated its previous accusation, and said she was supplying cocaine to the Zetas. In addition, the US Treasury included her daughter, Stefanel Castellanos Chacon, and other suspects as well (although her daughter does not appear among the accused in Florida court documents). This time, Chacon reacted. On October 22, 2012, she hired a lawyer in the United States. Meanwhile, the US Attorney's Office urged the court to keep the indictment sealed, because ""divulging the content, an ongoing investigation into federal offenses (in the Southern District of Florida as well as other districts), could seriously compromise the investigation and expose [certain] individuals to potential dangers."" Nevertheless, at the request of the prosecution, the judge authorized partial access only to Chacon, ""so that she can understand the charges against her, and her lawyer can make an informed decision on how to proceed."" In October 2012, in the indictment, Chacon's lawyer (who is not identified in the file) affirmed that Chacon ""understood that she faced criminal charges for which she can be prosecuted"" and that ""she wishes to hand herself in."" By then, Cesar Barrera had met with DEA agents in Colombia, who gave authorities information on some suspects the US was trying to capture in Guatemala and Mexico. In June 2013, Barrera handed himself over to the DEA in Panama. The US considered Klapper to be one of the ""most valuable government officials"" in combating drug trafficking, until - to Chacon's good fortune - she left the US Attorney's Office and became a defense lawyer. Within days Barrera was in Miami, where he talked with the DEA about other individuals the administration wanted to capture in Panama. Barrera was key to the US capturing and sentencing various suspects. The indictment reveals that he helped tighten the net around three important suspects, who are not identified, but could be ""El Loco"" Barrera, Borrayo, and Chacon. What transpired after Cesar Barrera collaborated with authorities was a whirlwind for Chacon and Borrayo. In April and July 2013, Chacon traveled to El Salvador twice, according to the registry of Guatemala's migration office. The second trip came just two weeks after Borrayo had traveled to Mexico and later to France, where he was captured for drug trafficking, on orders from the United States. Cesar Barrera, detained in Miami, changed his plea on drug trafficking charges from ""not guilty"" to ""guilty"" within 48 hours of the start of his October 2013 trail. In November, Chacon left Guatemala for five days to an unknown location before returning. That same month she traveled to Honduras, and came back 24 hours later. On February 9, 2014, Chacon traveled to Panama for five days. On February 20 she went back to Panama, but did not return to Guatemala. On March 14, 2014, Borrayo was extradited from France to Florida, and in May, Chacon agreed to a telephone interview with Prensa Libre and said that she was in France on vacation, because her daughter studied there. In addition, she revealed that in November she had a meeting with the US Treasury in order to resolve her situation, and that her husband and daughter were free from all accusations. Playing Chess in a Miami Court Chacon acted strategically. The potential declarations by her former accomplices, as well as accusations of drug trafficking against her, prompted her to hire a star lawyer: Bonnie S. Klapper, a former New York prosecutor. In 2012, Klapper was described in Colombia as a fiercely anti-mafia former prosecutor. In California, she specialized in investigating money laundering cases related to drug trafficking. In New York, Klapper focused on international money laundering and drug trafficking. Klapper co-led investigations that dismantled money laundering networks between New York and Colombia, which ended in an accusation against Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, brother of Armado Carrillo Fuentes, alias ""The Lord of the Skies,"" and former head of the Juarez Cartel in Mexico. In 2009, Klapper became part of a team of attorneys in the United States that targeted a Zetas leaders, Miguel Trevino Morales, for drug trafficking and weapons smuggling. Trevino was captured in Mexico in 2013. Bonnie S. Klapper was a prosecutor in New York before she became Chacon's defense lawyer The DEA referred to Klapper as the ""iron prosecutor."" The administration of US President Barack Obama considered Klapper to be one of the ""most valuable government officials"" in combating drug trafficking, until -- to Chacon's good fortune -- she left the US Attorney's Office and became a defense lawyer. She quickly counted among her clients prominent drug traffickers and suspects the US Treasury accused of money laundering. She worked with Jack Denaro on some cases, a lawyer based in Miami who was also representing Chacon. In 2014, Klapper decided to defend Chacon. On August 29, 2014, Klapper became Chacon's lawyer, and just days later Klapper recommended to Chacon that she turn herself in. Chacon's Agreement On September 10, 2014, US authorities fulfilled the warrant for Chacon's arrest that had been sent out three years earlier. That day, Chacon handed herself over to the US Marshals Service in Miami, and the US Attorney's Office solicited her preventive detention while she awaited trial. According to court documents, the presiding judge, William C. Turnoff, ordered the Federal Bureau of Prisons to exclude Chacon's name and identification number from electronic files (which are accessible to the public online) until the court ordered otherwise. The order to protect her information was so urgent that the note was handwritten by the judge, so that the instruction would be completed immediately. To divulge that Chacon was incarcerated would send the message that she had betrayed some of her close associates. In Miami, Chacon came before Judge Turnoff for the first time in mid-2014, and was present when the charges against her were read. She pleaded not guilty, and asked to be brought to court. She had 70 days for this to happen, or to change her mind and change her plea to guilty. The court scheduled her first hearing for December 1. But on October 14 of last year, Chacon pleaded guilty. Nevertheless, the prosecutor Botero asked the court to register the declaration of guilt on a date closer to December 16, because US government officials ""were still undertaking operations to capture various suspects, based in part on information from the accused."" There is no other information available on the captures. Botero explained that she asked to change the guilty plea date ""in order to minimize the risk that those who were captured would find out that [Chacon] was incarcerated in the United States."" In November of last year, Chacon gave her consent so that the US Attorney's Office and her lawyers could begin negotiations between December 16, 2014 and January 15, 2015 to reach an agreement on her plea and sentence. Chacon, who at the time was described as a ""cooperative defendant,"" gave her consent just one day after ""El Loco"" Barrera pleaded guilty to charges of drug trafficking in a New York court. On December 11, 2014, Chacon signed court document number 36 ""to accept that the crimes described here (between 2008 and 2011) were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and would be sufficient to find her guilty in the event she stands trial."" Court documents describing Chacon's criminal activity The ""Mea Culpa"" In court documents, Chacon admitted to having conspired to traffic five or more kilos of cocaine knowing they would be smuggled into the United States. She indicated that she knew her sentence would be imposed after a consideration of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, and that the court would also consider evidence presented against her. The document indicates that Chacon would not be able to rescind her guilty plea once she received her sentence. Under US law , for conspiring to distribute five or more kilos of cocaine, Chacon could be given a fine of up to $10 million dollars and receive a minimum of 10 years and a maximum of a life sentence in prison. The US Attorney's Office and the defense recommended sanctions for trafficking 500 kilos of cocaine, since Chacon collaborated, and she pleaded guilty in the stipulated time frame, saving the court from having to prepare itself to go to trial. For her role as an organizer and leader of criminal activity that involved five or more accomplices, they recommended a sentence of five to 40 years in prison and a fine of between $5 million and $25 million dollars. This sentencing range is similar to what was given to the Fernandez Barrero brothers. The US Attorney's Office could retract their recommendation if Chacon refuses to divulge the circumstances surrounding all of the charges against her, if she offers inaccurate information to the US government, or if she commits a federal offense. What's more, the court made it clear that the sentencing estimate ""is just a prediction, not a promise,"" and that the court is not obliged to follow it. Upon pleading guilty, Chacon also gave up her ability to appeal her sentence. She may still be at the mercy of the court for years, even following her release from prison, because she agreed to ""cooperate completely in this case, fulfill any requirement of the US Attorney's Office (including in other cases), serve as a confidential informant or an informant under guarded supervision, and not return to criminal activity or protect other criminal actors in this case."" With that agreement, Chacon signed her declaration, and on December 12, 2014, pleaded guilty before Judge Martinez. *This article was translated, edited, and reprinted with permission from Plaza Publica.

"Why Does Latin America Have the Worlds Highest Female Murder Rates?Latin America is the region with the most female murders on earth, a phenomenon partly due to organized crime activities such as human trafficking and gang violence. Just how do these criminal activities increase the victimization of women? A recent report by a number of international organizations revealed that seven out of the ten countries with the highest female murder rate in the world are in Latin America. El Salvador heads the list with a rate of 8.9 homicides per 100,000 women in 2012, followed by Colombia with 6.3, Guatemala with 6.2, Russia with 5.3 and Brazil with 4.8. Mexico and Suriname are also in the top ten. While general violence levels and domestic abuse are considered to be the main contributors to high femicide rates, organized crime also plays a huge yet overlooked role in the victimization of women in Latin America. As Guatemala's Attorney General Thelma Aldana told InSight Crime, 50 percent of the 854 women killed in Guatemala in 2015 were murdered as a direct result of organized crime. Human Trafficking and Female Murders ""The only case in which you can make a case that femicide is increasing as a result of transnational organized crime is human trafficking."" Human trafficking is a vast illegal economy in Latin America, and one that disproportionately affects women and girls. ""The only case in which you can make a case that femicide is increasing as a result of transnational organized crime is human trafficking in Central America and the Caribbean,"" InSight Crime was told by the Representative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Regional Office for Central America and the Caribbean, Amado Philip de Andres. Human trafficking victims to and from the region -- the majority of which are females between the ages of 18 and 28 -- are on the increase, and so are the number of fatalities. ""The femicide rate in cases of human trafficking for victims is very, very high,"" de Andres said. ""Especially for the purposes of sexual exploitation, which might account for 91 or 92 percent of the cases."" Female victims from across the region as well as other areas, such as Eastern Europe, are tricked into working in the sex trade where they are tortured, raped, and often murdered. One of the most troubling aspects of this form of crime is that, as de Andres points out, the woman's ""victimization never ends."" Even if the victims manage to escape or are rescued, they may be killed in retaliation, or even fall back into the trade if they are not given sufficient attention and alternative work opportunities, which they rarely are. Widespread impunity in human trafficking cases, fear of denouncing crimes, and the huge profitability of the market -- up to $320 million a year in the region alone, according to the UNODC official -- causes the victimization of women to be an ongoing reality. Women and girls are increasingly becoming victims of other variations of the crime, including a lucrative and often deadly illegal organ trafficking industry and the smuggling of migrants. Gang Violence Another Latin American phenomenon that can help explain the high rate of female murders is the presence of gangs. The Maras became a gang member's true ""family,"" while relatives became gang ""property."" While the majority of gang-related deaths are men, one of the fundamental threats to women is that they are considered to be the property of gang members. This is arguably the result of the origins of gangs themselves. According de Andres of the UNODC, femicides linked to Central America's Mara gangs can be traced back to Los Angeles in the 1980s, where the Maras first arose. As the Maras developed, a new form of social cohesion arose -- one which continues to be an essential trait of these groups today -- in which the Maras became a gang member's true ""family,"" while relatives became gang ""property,"" de Andres told InSight Crime. Consequently, during disputes between gangs, women are frequently caught in the crossfire, with girlfriends, sisters, and mothers targeted by rival gangs. In many cases, female relatives of imprisoned Mara members make easy targets for revenge killings, as the male is unable to protect them. What's more, according to the Mara ""code of honour,"" if a member betrays or abandons his own gang their most vulnerable ""possession"" is attacked -- which usually means the rape or murder of his sister or wife, de Andres explained. Girlfriends are also vulnerable. While men are seldom punished for infidelity, women can be killed for such behaviour. The oft-studied case of Mexico's Juarez, which saw 400 femicides between 1990 and 2005, is illustrative of how femicides often involve ""symbolic"" effects. Murdered women in Juarez were found to have undergone torture, rape, mutilation -- especially of the sexual organs and breasts, and decapitation. But those signs of torture are more anomalies in the pattern than the rule. Of the 400 cases documented in Juarez, all but 100 were resolved, and most of those cases involved domestic partners or people that the victim knew. Nonetheless, the brutal tactics seen on some of the victims do appear to be a means of delivering a message and are still common today, particularly in the Northern Triangle. According to Aldana, these brutal tactics not only bear the clear markings of organized crime, they are also an expression of misogyny. ""The difference in Guatemala between the death of a man and the death of a woman is that the woman is raped before she is killed, she is mutilated This does not happen to me n It is clear to see how misogyny is present up until the moment of a woman's death,"" she told InSight Crime. Women Who Work in Crime Femicides can also be high among women who become members of criminal organizations. ""Within organized crime, patriarchal structures and traditional gender roles continue to be reproduced,"" the Criminal Policy Unit of Colombia's Justice Ministry told InSight Crime. Indeed, women seldom occupy higher positions in an organization, and are rather used for menial, but often dangerous tasks. A Barrio 18 woman in a 2008 documentary about El Salvador gangs, ""La Vida Loca"" Perhaps the most high-profile of these largely female roles is the ""mula"" -- or drug ""mule"". This duty can all too frequently lead to death if drugs enter a woman's bloodstream, and she can also be killed as punishment for getting caught. In other criminal structures, women can be used as expendable members, working as extortion collectors or as drug dealers. Ending the Cycle Femicide and the overwhelming impunity surrounding it is a hot topic for law enforcement around the region. ""The law does not protect women who are involved in organized crime."" A fundamental problem hindering progress is that, as Guatemala Attorney General Aldana point s out, "" The law does not protect women who are involved in organized crime."" This is despite the fact that many women are co-opted into joining criminal structures. According to the attorney general, prosecutors need be disciplined enough to understand the difference between women who become involved with criminal organizations willingly and those are forced to join due to economic dependence, or other reasons. De Andres agrees that, although the legislation defining and criminalizing femicides is strong in many Latin American countries, what is lacking is prosecution and prevention. Re-victimization is a critical issue that can be resolved by increasing attention to victims, as well as protecting those who put themselves at risk by becoming witnesses. Given the nature of organized crime, international action is essential in preventing femicides. One response to this issue is a new UNODC-backed ""Blue Heart"" Campaign , which looks to raise awareness on human trafficking on transnational flights. Thelma Aldana, the Attorney General of Guatemala In Guatemala, the government established a specific law regarding femicide in 2008; launched a task force , created a special court for hearing these cases, and established a center where victims can give testimony and receive psychological treatment in the same place. Most recently, Aldana announced a Prosecutor's Office for Femicides's Office for Femicides that should be inaugurated in March 2016. And yet, she admits that there continues to be a discouraging resistance to the subject of femicides in her country. ""It is incredibly difficult for laws to be issued in favor of women to introduce a law requiring the judiciary to take a gendered approach in cases in which a woman is involved in crime, it can't be so,"" she said. ""I think we're a long way away from this way of working."""	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Argentina Rescues 45 Bolivians from Human Trafficking Ring. Argentine police reported dismantling a Bolivian-run human trafficking network in Buenos Aires, freeing 45 Bolivians from forced labor in textile workshops. Police raided the Villa Soldati neighborhood of Buenos Aires on April 9, shutting down five textile workshops in which the group of Bolivians -- including nine minors -- were ""enslaved,"" according to a police statement. In addition, police found 64 sewing machines and around $7,000 in cash, reported news agency EFE. Authorities believe that a Bolivian couple who formed part of the network's leadership recruited Bolivians with the promise of good jobs, stealing their identity documents upon arrival to Argentina. The rescue operation was the result of an investigation that began at the end of 2012. Argentina is an important destination for human trafficking victims, many of whom come from Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru. Authorities reported rescuing more than 700 victims in the first eight months of 2012, approximately half of them from outside Argentina. A Bolivian official claimed in 2011 that up to 15,000 Bolivian children were sold and sent to Argentina each year. The numbers indicate that Bolivia's human trafficking problem is increasing. Some 258 cases were reported in the first 11 months of 2012, compared with 190 in the whole of 2011. According to Peruvian authorities, around half of the underage females trafficked to a Peruvian mining town for commercial sexual exploitation were of Bolivian origin. Despite the growing problem, Bolivia has achieved only two human trafficking convictions in six years, despite hundreds of cases being reported to authorities."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"US Blacklists Venezuela in Human Trafficking Report. A new report by the U.S. government criticizes Venezuela for failing to enforce existing anti-human trafficking laws. But it's worth noting that poverty and unemployment may be contributing to the problem just as much as weak legislation. The new U.S. State Department report on human trafficking designates Venezuela a Tier 3 country, a status used by the U.S. to identify countries with poor records of fighting trafficking. According to the report, Venezuelans are smuggled abroad, often to work as prostitutes, while foreign nationals are trafficked into the country, often to serve as forced labor in factories, or work in the sex trade. Venezuelan authorities have previously said Chinese-run criminal groups are in the country , shipping in Asian immigrants who are then exploited. Previous U.S. reports have identified Venezuelan trafficking rings that smuggle Brazilian, Colombian, Ecuadorean, Peruvian, and Dominican migrants. The government also fails to do enough to fight sex trafficking within the country, the report says. These cases are harder to spot, as the victims do not cross any international borders and so do not need to show identification. Women are often brought from the poorer interior of the country to work in the sex trade in urban areas such as Caracas, Maracaibo, and Margarita island. One non-governmental organization estimated in 2003 that there were some 40,000 to 50,000 child prostitutes in Venezuela. They are often controlled by organized criminal groups, who manage much of the trafficking in Venezuela, according to the State Department report. The U.S. report criticizes the Venezuelan government for failing to take proper action against trafficking, even though Venezuela has made moves towards strengthening its anti-trafficking legislation. Its 2000 constitution did not specifically ban human trafficking , only the related practices of enslavement or forced prostitution. In 2007, Congress passed a women's rights law, which included provisions to ban the internal trafficking of Venezuelan women. However, as the State Department points out, this does not prohibit the trafficking of men and boys within the country. Each year's report has pointed out this loophole since the law was passed, and this appears to be a mayor reason for Venezuela's status being downgraded. The report also notes that authorities fail to give proper care to victims of trafficking, or to ensure lengthy jail terms for those convicted. But beyond putting legislation in place or arranging after-care for victims, just as important in the fight against trafficking may be the broader issue of providing education and opportunity to Venezuelans. The government has warned that young people are often fooled by traffickers, who promise work or education, such as the chance to study in Europe. Once they have left their homes, they often have no way of paying to return. Improving job or education opportunities for Venezuelans at home would help prevent these kinds of cases. While government statistics show that the proportion of Venezuelans living in poverty more than halved between 1997 and 2009, opposition figures have often pointed to the insufficiency of the minimum wage to purchase basic food supplies. The current minimum wage hovers around 1,400 bolivares , while the value of a basic food basket (which includes items like powdered milk, rice, salt and so on) was just under 1,490 in May 2011, according to the national statistics body INE. Venezuela has rejected the Tier 3 classification by the U.S., calling it ""meddling."" Indeed it is possible, as analyst Adam Isacson has pointed out , that the U.S.'s classifications are influenced by political considerations. The best-ranked country in Latin America is Colombia, which is a firm U.S. ally. Meanwhile Cuba and Venezuela, which have strained relationships with the U.S., are ranked the worst in the hemisphere.

Majority of Businesses Hurt by Crime in Mexico: Report. A new report from Mexico's statistics institute provides fresh evidence that the country's ongoing security crisis has taken a toll on the local economy, particularly on large businesses. Of more than 35,000 businesses surveyed in 2017, a third reported being victims of crimes, including robbery, shoplifting and extortion, according to the latest National Survey of Business Victimization (Encuesta Nacional de Victimizacion de Empresas - ENVE), by Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia - INEGI). This is the fourth time the INEGI has released its report, which has now found that large businesses are particularly targeted by criminal groups, both big and small. Yet nearly 32 percent of Mexico's micro-businesses , which are defined as those that employ ten or fewer people and represent around 97 percent of the number of Mexican firms, reported suffering a crime in 2017. In contrast, small, medium, and large firms reported higher rates of victimization: 59.3 percent, 61.5 percent, and 51.4 percent, respectively. The findings of the fourth ENVE survey paint a devastating picture of how Mexico's security crisis is affecting the nation's economy. Nearly one-fifth of the businesses surveyed reported that they had reduced their hours of operation as a result of criminal threats. More than six percent said they had simply pulled out altogether, and 13 percent reported having reduced investments. Whether directly or indirectly, all of these responses represent a reduction of Mexico's economic activity. While the ENVE doesn't look at how the high level of crimes against businesses affects Mexico's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), there's evidence that the nation's growth has lagged behind that of its Latin American and North American neighbors for most of the past two decades. As the ENVE survey shows, the relentless difficulties legitimate business face from criminal groups is one major reason. A separate INEGI study recently estimated that insecurity costs the nation nearly 1.65 percent in annual GDP growth. SEE MORE: Mexico News and Profiles ENVE does not distinguish between petty criminals and organized crime groups. Certain common crimes like shoplifting and fraud have few natural ties to such groups. However, organized crime groups either engage in or enable several of the most frequent illegal acts that plague businesses: extortion, but also armed robbery and the corruption of government officials. Similarly, the business community's withdrawal from the economy was most pronounced in the three states where extortion and other aspects of organized crime have worsened: Veracruz, Guerrero, and Zacatecas. The ENVE survey also inadvertently explains why the government has been unable to tackle this crisis. Businesses reported crimes against them only 16 percent of the time, which led to police investigations in 85 percent of those cases. When explaining their reluctance to report crimes, business owners cited a lack of faith in the government's ability to prosecute criminals, a fear of the criminals themselves, and a distrust of the police. Even in the small minority of cases that sparked investigations, it's unlikely the perpetrators will be caught and punished. According to one recent study , just 12 percent of the nation's criminal investigations resulted in a conviction or an acquittal. Such a small chance that criminals will be brought to justice sends the message that illegal activities are effectively allowed. Against this backdrop, many businesses end up paying off criminal groups or choose to close down, and the result is Mexico's economy continues to suffer.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
El Salvador Police Underestimate Extortion: Reluctance to Report. El Salvador's police said that criminals received $8 million in extortion fees over a 20-month period, a number that business unions insist is just a fraction of the real figure, due to the fact that most cases are not being reported to police. In a report obtained by InSight Crime via La Prensa Grafica, the National Civil Police reported that a total of $7.9 million in extortion fees was paid out in El Salvador between January 2013 and August 15, 2014. According to the document, the most common victims were businesses owners, who lost $2.2 million to a reported 1,448 cases of extortion. Police figures showed that other interest groups heavily impacted by extortion included larger companies and the public transportation sector. Another 1,113 extortion victims didn't identify their profession, but lost a total of $1.8 million during the 20-month period. In contrast, business unions claimed criminal groups earn at least $53 million from extorting the commercial sector each year, reported La Prensa Grafica. According to a survey conducted by the National Council of Small Businesses of El Salvador (CONAPES), 97 percent of businesses are being extorted, but most haven't reported the crime due to a lack of trust in the police. The huge discrepancy between the number of extortion cases registered by police and those registered by the business sector highlights how reluctant people are to report the crime, thanks to a combination of mistrust in law enforcement officials and the belief that reporting would be futile. This problem is not limited to El Salvador's business sector. According to police figures, there were only 168 cases of extortion in the public transportation sector during the 20-month period, costing the industry a total of $217,000, but public transportation unions told El Diario de Hoy in January that they pay around $3 million a month in extortion fees. Extortion is a major source of income for El Salvador's powerful street gangs, including the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Barrio 18. In the past, gangs have used a variety of tactics to extort individuals and businesses, including exploiting poorly regulated money transfer systems and largely unregulated private security companies to extort the business and transportation industries.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
