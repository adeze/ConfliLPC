EPL Muscles in on El Naya Drug Corridor in West Colombia. The killing of four people in Jamundi, Valle del Cauca, may have been the EPL's way of announcing its entrance to one of Colombia's strategic drug corridors: El Naya. The guerrilla group has increased its presence there recently, creating a possible ticking time bomb for western Colombia. The four people killed -- all family members -- had their bodies thrown from a truck in Villacolombia, a town in the southern part of the Valle Del Cauca municipality, El Tiempo reported. Though the motives behind the killings remain unclear, authorities are investigating whether the murders were related to score-settling or extortion payments. Though the Popular Liberation Army (Ejercito Popular de Liberacion - EPL) has long had a presence in the northeastern department of Norte de Santander, along the Venezuela border, a small group of guerrilla fighters appears to have moved into the western part of the country. Since 2017, soldiers in the region have even battled this group of fighters under the EPL banner. The group appears to have 100 men in the sector as they fight for control over the Naya corridor, a route between the departments of Valle del Cauca and Cauca. The latter is one of the major coca-producing regions and is linked by river to the southern Pacific port of Buenaventura, from which shipments of cocaine leave the country for Central America. Besides the small EPL force, other groups are also present in this region: the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN), dissident members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) members of Mexico's cartels. They are all fighting to control this key criminal enclave between Naya and Jamundi, where thousands of kilograms of cocaine leave each month. Such a fierce territorial dispute has left the civilian population caught in the crossfire. According to reports from the Army, the EPL's interest in controlling the drug market in this region is so strong that they are offering $750 (2.5 million pesos) to $950 (3 million pesos) to former FARC members willing to guard coca cultivations and fight the EPL's principal rivals, the ELN and FARC dissidents. Those two groups, it is believed, have already reached an agreement to take on the EPL forces together. The EPL is strengthening its presence in the Naya corridor for two reasons. The first is that the EPL is fighting the ELN in Norte de Santander where, according to sources, they are likely to be decimated by the larger guerrilla group, because the ELN is stronger and also controls the Venezuelan border region. The EPL appears to be moving into Naya as a way to sustain itself economically. The second is the cost of trafficking drugs along the Venezuelan border, where the EPL must protect the product and transport it by land. Whereas in Naya, the EPL would only need to bring the drug shipments to the ocean port. There, the buyer would be in charge of transport, lessening the costs to the group significantly. The presence of the Mexican cartels could also play an important role, since Colombian groups are often subcontracted by the cartels to send drugs. The EPL would not only be advancing its own interests but also would become yet another player in the cartels' war in Colombia. In any case, the Naya corridor and western part of the country appear ready to explode in a battle for the control of the cocaine market. 	1	0	0	1	0	0	1
"Campaign Group Warns of Dangers for Colombia Elections. International Crisis Group has warned that illegal armed groups in Colombia will try to expand their power in upcoming local government elections, and released a list of recommendations for bodies involved in the elections. The campaign group warned that the high number of murders of candidates in the run-up to the October 2011 local elections is a sign that the ""decade-old trend of decreasing electoral violence could be reversed."" International Crisis Group (ICG) called on political parties to rigorously screen candidates and discard any with suspected links to illegal groups, such as the paramilitaries. It said that both parties and candidates should public their records of campaign donations. Among the recommendations ICG made to the government were to release funds so that a planned biometric voter identification system can be used in the upcoming elections. The report highlights the difference in approach between guerrilla groups, which tend to sabotage elections, and paramilitary groups, which focus on infiltrating government to gain access to resources.

"InSight: Report Tracks How Intra-Cartel Wars Exploded in Mexico. Perhaps the most startling thing about the latest Trans-Border Institute's (TBI) report on violence in Mexico is not just that it is backed up by Mexican government statistics, but that these numbers are worse than what the TBI published in its previous reports using data compiled by Mexican media outlets. Released on Tuesday, 'Drug Violence in Mexico: Data and Analysis Through 2010' follows the TBI's first report on violence, which came out last year around this time and has since been widely distributed and cited. In the new report, TBI Director David Shirk and co-author Viridiana Rios of Harvard University take a look at Mexico's exploding violence, using data on drug-related homicides recently made available by the government in January 2011. Before, tracking the rise of drug violence in Mexico meant relying on media estimates or conflicting definitions over what exactly is a ""drug-related"" murder. While the report's conclusions do not contradict the general consensus among crime analysts - namely, the violence will likely continue to get worse - with the inclusion of government data, the Institute is able to give a more complete picture of the nature of Mexico's drug war. {japopup type=""image"" content=""/images/killings.jpg"" title=""Mexico Homicides""} {/japopup} Rios and Shirk identify a number of factors that have increased drug related violence in Mexico but acknowledge that the most important is inter-cartel competition. Government intervention, particularly pronounced and successful against the Familia Michoacana , has served to destabilize the balance of power among cartels. Data also shows that generally speaking, violence has increased in proportion to the use of federal troops and police. Ciudad Juarez is a case in point: Mexican government troops and federal police have proven unable to quell the violence here despite a large presence. Juarez, a critical transit point for drugs entering the U.S. Midwest and East Coast markets, is ground zero in a turf war between the Carillo Fuentes Organization (CFO) a.k.a., the Juarez Cartel , and the Sinaloa Cartel , led by Joaquin Guzman Loera , alias 'El Chapo.' The violence there is the worst in the country, and has been characterized by the utilization of street gangs like Barrio Azteca, car-bombings against police forces, and scorched-earth policies designed to remove residents of surrounding rural towns from their strategically valuable smuggling corridors. Drastic jumps in homicides in Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, and San Luis Potosi are best explained by the turf war following the split between the Gulf Cartel and their former armed wing the Zetas. The Gulf Cartel has entered an alliance with Sinaloa and the Familia Michoacana, while the Zetas and the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) have allied against their former masters with violent tactics including narco-blockades. Of note, Nuevo Leon, home state to Monterrey (considered the industrial/entrepreneurial hub of northern Mexico), has witnessed a nearly six-fold increase in drug-related homicides, from 112 in 2009 to 604 in 2010. While it is nowhere near the most violent state, the psychological impact upon the city and the nation cannot be underestimated. Baja California, home to one of the most lucrative U.S. points of entry (POE), appears to have cooled, depending on what numbers are analyzed; if Mexican government numbers are used, drug-related homicides increased by 11.6 percent, from 484 in 2009 to 540 in 2010. On the other hand, when the Mexican newspaper Reforma's count is used, homicides dropped from 320 in 2009 to 315 in 2010. Both sets of data show a clear drop after a spike in 2008 when a faction led by Eduardo Garcia Simental, alias 'El Teo,' split from the remnants of the Tijuana Cartel led by Fernando Sanchez Arellano , alias 'El Ingeniero.' Anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that Baja California citizens feel safer despite the recent increase, suggesting that what might be most important is not the year-to-year change but the memory of how bad things can get. An 11.6 percent increase is mild compared to the 292 percent increase they experienced from 2007-08. Following the arrests of Garcia and his top leadership in early 2010, Fernando Sanchez Arellano appears to have negotiated a truce with the Sinaloa Cartel's Ismael Zambada Garcia , alias 'El Mayo,' to the benefit of both illicit networks and the safety of Baja California citizens. How long this agreement lasts probably depends on the abilities of both groups to consolidate their power bases throughout Baja and the creation of any power imbalances during this process. The Sinaloa Cartel appears to have learned an operational lesson from its bloody split with the BLO and is annexing the Teo cells in Baja to prevent them from attaining an independent power base. The state of Sinaloa, meanwhile, is racked with drug violence, due to the battle between the Sinaloa Cartel and the Beltran Leyva Organization and the weakening of Familia Michoacana, as Shirk and Rios describe. The Pacific coastline of Sinaloa and Guerrero represent excellent climate for marijuana/poppy cultivation, wide-open coastline for maritime drug shipments from the Andes and valuable territory worth fighting for. Overall rates of violence appear poised to continue their upward trend into 2011, barring a dramatic change, for example, an electoral victory of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional - PRI) combined with a negotiated peace agreement between the Mexican government and cartels. But even if the PRI wins, a pact appears incredibly unlikely. Recent polls indicate that 49 percent of Mexican citizens believe the current strategy is a failure. While they may say that for the polls and local elections, when the push comes to the shove of national elections and the control of the military and federal police forces, Mexican citizens are likely to support candidates that will ""stay the course,"" unless a viable alternative is proposed. *Jones is a PhD candidate at the University of California Irvine.

"Colombia Cocaine Production Breaks New Record Levels: UNODC Report. Cocaine production in Colombia broke new records in 2017, ushering in a new era of criminal violence among the many armed actors vying to control the lucrative industry as criminal dynamics continue to take shape after the departure of the FARC rebels. Annual cocaine production in Colombia jumped 31 percent from a previous record of 1,053 metric tons in 2016 to 1,379 in 2017 and the number of hectares under coca cultivation rose 17 percent from 146,000 hectares in 2016 to 171,000 in 2017, according to illicit crop monitoring data published September 19 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Estimates released by the US White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) in June of this year, however, put the number of cocaine produced at 921 metric tons and the total number of hectares under coca cultivation at 209,000 in 2017. Colombia continues to be the world's principal producer of cocaine with the Pacific region accounting for nearly 40 percent of the country's coca crops, followed by the Central region with a little more than 30 percent, according to the UNODC. The number of hectares under coca cultivation in the country has steadily increased each year since 2013. The continued increase in the amount of coca being planted in Colombia can, in part, be explained by the government's struggle to meet an ambitious eradication goal that includes a coca crop substitution program threatened by criminal violence and a lack of viable alternatives for coca growers, in addition to other logistical and political obstacles. This continued uptick in cocaine production has caused increased criminal violence. In general, the ex-FARC mafia -- networks of former fighters from the largely demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) -- and the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) are the principal armed actors influencing Colombia's cocaine trade. A number of other smaller groups are also fighting for control. In response, the Colombian government has increased the presence of security forces in key drug trafficking corridors throughout the country, which has had a balloon effect and displaced criminal actors and their drug trafficking activities to key border regions in Ecuador and Venezuela. Below, InSight Crime looks at criminal dynamics in four key areas affected by skyrocketing cocaine production in the Andean nation. (Shifts in coca cultivation between 2016 and 2017 in Colombia c/o UNODC report) Narino Department The southwest department of Narino along Colombia's Pacific coast remains the country's main coca-producing area with 45,735 hectares under coca cultivation in 2017, according to the UNODC. This is also where security forces have concentrated many of their resources, forcing criminal groups to innovate and venture across the border into Ecuador. At the heart of this dynamic is the ex-FARC mafia network known as the Oliver Sinisterra front, led by Ecuadorean national Walter Arizala Vernaza, alias ""Guacho."" His network has utilized innovative strategies like subterranean drug labs near the Colombia-Ecuador border in an effort to evade authorities, and a series of violent attacks -- including the killing of three Ecuadorean press workers -- suggests they are fortifying their presence in the border region. In response, authorities in Colombia and Ecuador have boosted security cooperation. The wounding of Guacho in a recent military operation suggests that security forces may be zeroing in on him and his network, which has already impacted criminal dynamics in this strategic region. Guaviare Department While south-central Guaviare department saw one of the biggest decreases in the number of hectares under coca cultivation in 2017, it hovers near Colombia's borders with Venezuela and Brazil, two extremely important places for cocaine shipments. With security forces occupied on the other side of the country, record cocaine production is helping the 1st Front dissidence grow stronger here due to the key trafficking routes it features. Brazil is the world's second largest consumer of cocaine and has long been used as a key shipping point for international drug shipments. Venezuela is also a fundamental transshipment point for drug shipments coming from Colombia, and the country's increasingly criminalized regime helps facilitate the safe passage of such shipments. With the 1st Front dissidence in control of coca cultivation in all of Guaviare and the surrounding area, the laboratories where coca paste is transformed into cocaine hydrochloride and two international trafficking routes, the network looks poised to continue expanding their criminal activities as cocaine continues to flow and security forces have their hands full elsewhere. Catatumbo Region Colombia's Catatumbo region near the border with Venezuela consists of 11 municipalities in Norte de Santander department, which, according to the UNODC, saw a 14 percent increase in the number of hectares under coca cultivation in 2017, and is currently at the heart of a brutal battle between the ELN and the Popular Liberation Army (Ejercito Popular de Liberacion - EPL) over control of drug trade interests formerly controlled by the FARC. However, the arrival of 1st Front dissidence leader Gener Garcia Molina, alias ""Jhon 40,"" to the region in an effort to organize a growing number of former FARC rebels from the 33rd Front that have picked up arms again threatens to throw the already volatile fight for control over the region's lucrative drug trade into further disarray. Bajo Cauca Region The Bajo Cauca region of northwest Antioquia department, where, according to the UNODC, the number of hectares under coca cultivation increased by 55 percent in 2017, has long been the site of criminal clashes due to its contraband routes and coca crops, among other illicit attractions. Today, the Urabenos -- formerly Colombia's most powerful criminal organization before being replaced by networks of FARC dissidents -- is battling it out against an ex-FARC mafia network of former fighters from the FARC's 36th Front that is aligned with a splinter group known as the Caparrapos for control over illicit economies. Aside from its criminal economies, Bajo Cauca is prized territory due to its proximity to the port city of Turbo on the coast of the Gulf of Uraba, a strategic launching point for drug shipments heading north that will grow increasingly important as cocaine continues to pour out of the country. *This article was written with assistance from InSight Crime's Colombian Organized Crime Observatory.

"Costa Rica Battles Illegal Logging Gangs. Authorities in Costa Rica have called attention to the problem of illicit logging in the country, underlining the country's significant role in the highly profitable global illegal timber trade. According to Luis Martinez, coordinator of the Prosecutor's Office on Agriculture and the Environment, the political and economic power of developers seeking to clear forest often allows them to ""find a way"" around tight regulations through falsified documents and corrupt officials, reported La Nacion. In 2012 the National System of Conservation Areas (Sinac) received over 2,200 complaints about illegal logging, of which 610 were processed by the courts. During that time, the Statistics Section of the Judiciary reported making 1,100 complaints to the Public Prosecutor, resulting in just 26 convictions, reported La Nacion. According to Gustavo Mata, deputy director of the Judicial Investigation Organization (OIJ), the logging is carried out by small groups with ""a capacity to move around in the mountains that authorities don't have."" Mata said these groups rely on a network of sawmills and transporters which process the lumber then feed it into the legitimate market. Illegal logging continues in Costa Rica in the context of successful government policies to reforest the country, which have seen the country's forest cover more than double since its record low in 1990, according to figures from the Ministry of Environment and Energy. The global illegal timber trade is estimated to be worth between $30 billion and $100 billion per year, and Latin America is one of its global hubs. An International Police Community (Interpol) operation targeting logging in the region led to the seizure of over $40 million of illegal timber in the first seven months of 2013, most of it coming from Costa Rica and Venezuela. As seen in Costa Rica -- one of the countries least tainted by corruption in the region -- the combination of abundant forests and official graft facilitates the illegal trade, with a report released in 2010 highlighting how poor pay and lack of resources corrupts many forestry regulators in the Central American nation. As well as being a major source for illegal timber, Costa Rica is also a hub for other illegal activities that take advantage of its natural environment, including animal trafficking , and shark finning , which was officially banned in 2012 ."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Black Market Weapons Find New Routes to Mexico. Contralinea magazine details the routes by which guns are trafficked into Mexico, including the flow of arms from the U.S. directly to Guatemala, and then over Mexico's southern border. Because the recent spike in drug-related violence in Mexico has coincided with the 2004 expiration of the U.S. assault weapons ban, and because a significant portion of the weapons used in Mexican crimes have been traced to U.S. vendors, Mexican officials often accuse liberal U.S. gun laws of being a major obstacle to a safer Mexico. Indeed, President Felipe Calderon made precisely this point during a speech to U.S. Congress in 2010. U.S. officials have not denied that the problem exists. As InSight Crime noted, President Obama lamented his government's inability to make headway against the flow of arms traffic, calling the task ""impossible"" earlier this month. One Los Angeles official recently termed the southward arms flow between his city and Tijuana an ""ammo pipeline."" The anger over the ""Fast and Furious"" scandal, in which U.S. federal agents allowed weapons to cross the Mexican border in order to track their flow towards criminal groups, has furthered the image of a U.S. government careless about the impact the country's arms may have on Mexico. Several of the guns purchased under Fast and Furious were later used in crimes, including the murder of a U.S. Border Patrol official last December. However, the legacy of the Central American civil wars between the 1960s and 1980s, which flooded the region with small arms, has also contributed to the availability of lethal weapons in Mexico. There are* several recent examples of soldiers looting official arms caches and reselling them on the black market in nations like El Salvador. The following is a partial translation by InSight Crime of a recent report from Contralinea on the challenges of the illegal arms trade: With just one click on an Internet search engine, Francisco Sanchez has multiple options for the object of his interest: a Pietro Beretta 9 millimeter piece, offered at 10,500 pesos [roughly $775]. Sanchez wants to buy a semi-automatic weapon, which are only for use by the army, without requesting permission from the Secretariat of National Defense (Sedena), the only agency in Mexico that hands out licenses to carry arms. In short, he will acquire an illegal weapon. To buy it he doesn't need to go to a rough neighborhood, to a market like El Salado in Iztapalapa, or to a neighborhood like San Felipe de Jesus, in the Gustavo A. Madero*barrio (the largest in Latin America), two important areas for the black market for weapons. Nor does he have a contact with a friend of a friend of a police officer or soldier. To acquire a gun it's enough to sit down in front of a computer and, from the intimacy of your home, office, or any location, do a quick search to complete the transaction. Small arms are sold on hundreds of internet pages, with the deal agreed upon in chats, prices haggled over in computer messages or over cell phones. Since 2005, the Attorney General's office (PGR, for its initials in Spanish) recognized that*organized crime groups could acquire weaponry over the Internet. But today it's not just the criminals, but also civilians like Sanchez, who, overwhelmed by the growing insecurity and criminality gripping the country, see owning guns as a way to defend their life, their property, and their family. Even if citizens are purchase weapons for self-defense, the problem is that by buying them on the black market they feed the cycle of illegality, and increase the profits of the industry of death, says Edgardo Buscaglia, a UN adviser on issues of security and organized crime. International organizations estimate that some 20 million illegal weapons circulate in Mexican territory, in addition to the 5.5 million authorized by Sedena; that is, for every legal gun there are at least four illegal ones. The black market for guns in the country is increasingly open, ""almost unchecked,"" in the words of the secretary general of the Organization of American States, Jose Miguel Insulza. It has penetrated an ever-growing number of structures in society, not only in the criminal realm. For two decades, [Mexico's] southern border has been a port of entry for the weapons that feed the country's black market. There are 956 miles of border between Mexico and Guatemala, where it is enough to arrive to cities like Ciudad Hidalgo, Ciudad Cuauhtemoc, or in border towns like Corozal, Talisman or Carmen Xhan, cross the checkpoints and walk around Tecun Uman, La Mesilla, Peten, El Carmen and Gracias a Dios to be offered weapons. Salesmen in shacks, adobe huts, or in the middle of the street offer the old M-16s and Galils that the Central American civil wars left behind; or more modern weapons, like the M72 and AT4 (anti-tank rockets), RPG-7 rocket-launchers, or 37-millimeter MGL grenade-launchers, with tracers and armor-piercing capacity, sold by catalogue, and a one-week wait before delivery. The weapons arrive mostly from the United States, through air or maritime routes to Guatemala for distribution in Mexico, Central America, or South America. The advantage that this market offers is that purchases can be made without any middlemen, and that crossing is much easier than on the northern border. Weapons acquired in Guatemala to supply the black market in Mexico are transported using the ""hormiga"" method, among the belongings of those who cross the border between the two countries -- identified as one of the most porous in the world. Or, if they are large shipments, they are transported along the Suchiate River, or in secret compartments in vehicles that cross the border, or in collusion with immigration and customs officials. The Mexican government identifies four principal routes through which U.S. arms enter. The Pacific route, whose entry point is Tijuana, and passes though Mexicali, San Luis Rio Colorado, Nogales, Hermosillo, Culiacan, Tepic, Guadalajara, Lazaro Cardenas, Morelia, Chilpancingo y Oaxaca. The central route, which passes through Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Durango, Guadalajara, and Morelia. Through the Gulf route, they come via Ciudad Acuna, Piedras Negras, Nuevo Laredo, Miguel Aleman, Reynosa, Matamoros, before moving on to Ciudad Victoria, Veracruz, and Tabasco or Oaxaca. And the southern route, in the border towns of Balancan, Ciudad Cuauhtemoc, Tapachula and Ciudad Hidalgo, and moving on to Tuxtla Gutierrez, and from there to Veracruz and Oaxaca. Magda Coss explains how the legal weapons that the government acquires become part of this market: ""Many of the weapons that comprise this black market are transfers from the government to supply their armed forces. The problem is that, owing to the corruption and the weakness of the institutions, much of the weaponry is diverted illegally and with premeditation, or through theft, to supply the black market. This is facilitated by the hidden identity of the ultimate user, and by the corruption of the officials and agents of the armed forces and national security."" The origin of the problem, Coss says, is that there is not ""adequate and transparent"" monitoring of legal transfers. In her book, ""Trafico de armas en Mexico,"" she reports that from 2000 to 2008, Sedena was notified of the robbery of 6,932 weapons from 40 state public security agencies and local prosecutors' offices, in addition to the Federal Police and the PGR. This figure represented 60 percent of the guns confiscated over the same period. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Bolivia Coca Growers Fight for Control of Legal Production. Violent tensions are flaring in Bolivia's capital between hostile factions of one of the country's coca growers' unions, escalating a long-simmering conflict for control of legal coca production in the Andean nation. The clashes broke out at the beginning of August between two sectors of the Departmental Association of Coca Producers of La Paz (Asociacion Departamental de Productores de Coca de La Paz -- Adepcoca) -- one group loyal to President Evo Morales, the other to jailed union boss Franklin Gutierrez. While the former group has staged elections for new union leaders, the latter continues to demand the release of Gutierrez and other jailed unionists, claiming that the elections were organized by government stooges to undermine the association. Gutierrez was arrested in August 2018 on charges he allegedly masterminded the murder of police officer Daynor Sandoval. Sandoval's death occurred when a group of coca growers reportedly ambushed members of a combined task force charged with eradicating illegal coca plantations in the community of La Asunta, located in Yungas province northeast of the capital La Paz. Since his arrest, Gutierrez has become a symbol of the growing conflict between Morales' government and the coca growers of Yungas. Tensions have spiraled since Bolivia's 2017 Coca Law extended legal coca cultivation for traditional use, ending Yungas' monopoly on legal production and authorizing previously illicit plantations in Morales' home province of Chapare. Simultaneously, the Morales government increased eradication activities in unauthorized growing areas, including 1,500 hectares in La Asunta. This sparked a furious response from Gutierrez and other leaders of Adepcoca, the coca growers' union covering Yungas province and La Paz. They insist that the distinction between ""authorized"" and ""unauthorized"" plantations does not correspond to the distinction between crops grown for licit and illicit purposes, and that communities such as La Asunta are being made scapegoats for Chapare's supplying of the cocaine industry. Nine members of Adepcoca are currently behind bars , accused of crimes such as attacks on authorities and possession of dynamite. Their followers hold frequent protests for the release of who they call political prisoners, claiming that they were arrested on trumped up charges to undermine opposition to the Coca Law. Since 2017, clashes between police and demonstrators opposed to the Coca Law have resulted in six deaths and 23 injuries, according to El Pais. The coca growers' conflict shines a spotlight on a regional divide that has shadowed President Morales' move to legalize traditional coca use in the country. The question at its heart: Is the Bolivian government genuine in its claims of "" coca yes, cocaine no ,"" or is it merely undermining traditional growers while permitting production that fuels the illegal market? The 2017 Coca Law brought the legal area of coca cultivation in the country up to 22,000 hectares -- 14,300 in Yungas and 7,700 in Chapare. According to a 2013 study, the legal coca market can be supplied by 14,700 hectares of coca, implying an excess of roughly 7,000 hectares. The 2017 coca cultivation survey produced by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated the total area under coca cultivation in the country at 24,500 hectares, implying that up to 9,800 hectares are entering the illegal market. While Yungas is the region that has historically grown coca leaf that is chewed by Bolivia's indigenous communities, Chapare arose as an alternative production center in the 1980s, primarily growing coca as a base for cocaine. At first glance, the UNODC's figures seem to support Yungas' claims that Chapare is still primarily responsible for this illicit supply. Bolivia's overall coca production has been on the rise since 2016, reversing a five-year declining trend. Production rose 17 percent in Chapare from 2016 to 2017, and only one percent in Yungas. This brought Chapare to account for 34 percent of land in Bolivia under coca cultivation. Due to the higher productivity of Chapare's fields, the UNODC estimates that the region produced almost half the country's coca leaf. But its one authorized market accounted for only nine percent of sales. However, the UNODC also notes that Chapare's market is much less accessible than in Yungas, meaning that growers in Chapare are more inclined to sell their product directly to local distributors. This does not necessarily mean that it is used for non-traditional purposes. Although it still seems likely that more coca from Chapare enters the illegal market than from Yungas, Chapare also accounts for more eradication activities: 78 percent, next to Yungas' 18 percent, according to the UNODC. The available data makes it difficult to state with certainty whether government eradication policies unfairly target the Yungas growers. Furthermore, the current distribution of authorized growing areas was the product of extended negotiations in which the growers' unions of both provinces were involved. The irony, however, is that current forced eradication policies and violent battles with coca growers are starting to bear resemblance to the actions of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Bolivia in the 1980s and 1990s , which Morales fiercely opposed."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Colombian Govt Cant Confirm Death of FARC Leader. Colombian authorities still cannot confirm that Pablo Benito Cabrera, alias ""Fabian Ramirez,"" a top commander of the FARC, died when the Colombian Air Force bombed his camp November 20. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos told the press that the commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia's (FARC) Southern Bloc had ""apparently"" died after the bombing. Authorities gathered many of Cabrera's personal items including a diary (photo), but they have yet to find evidence of his body. Cabrera joined the FARC as teenager and rose through the ranks due to his military prowess and entrepreneurial skills. He is thought to have close ties to drug trafficking groups in Mexico, including the Juarez and Tijuana Cartels. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"AMLO Jumping the Gun With Wild Claims About Mexico Security. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador hailed a massive improvement in his nation's security, but the gains he trumpeted have little real value. During a press conference on January 30, Lopez Obrador (known as ""AMLO"") announced that the prior day, Mexico had registered only 54 murders across the nation, a drop of nearly a third from the average of 80 murders a day. He presented this as a sign that his security policy, which deemphasizes militarized conflict with criminal groups, was already having a positive effect. In the same conference, he declared that there was no war against organized crime. However, it is impossible to base such analysis on a single day. Entire months have been statistical outliers in determining whether a security improvement has taken root. In April 2008 , murders in Juarez temporarily plummeted to less than 60 amid a robust military deployment. But within weeks, the level of violence rebounded to its prior level of hundreds per month, and the war for the border city continued unabated despite the troops patrolling the street. The current data indicates that Mexico remains as violent as it was under Lopez Obrador's predecessor, Enrique Pena Nieto. In December 2018, the first month with Lopez Obrador in the presidency, Mexico registered 2,916 murders. This figure, taken from the National Public Security System (SNSP, for its initials in Spanish), represents a 9 percent increase from the same month in 2017. It is also the most violent month Mexico has witnessed since the SNSP began compiling these figures in the 1990s. Deriving any conclusion about Mexico's public security on the basis of a single day is a fundamentally flawed approach. The administration's determination to lower the number of murders is laudable, but any data set will have outliers, and it is impossible to know if a day's results are part of a broader trend. The SNSP will not release its figures for January for several weeks, but there is little to suggest an instantaneous transformation. Though it is his responsibility, it is too early in Lopez Obrador's presidency to blame his policies for persistent bloodshed. But it is not too soon to expect him to address this issue with clarity and honesty, and his comments last week fall well short. AMLO's statement reflects two separate trends that have prevailed in his nascent presidency. The most obvious is that the president's policy statements often seem mostly guided by his desired outcomes rather than empirical analysis. It appears as if Lopez Obrador chose to believe that his new government has brought about a transformation in the nation's security, and he is willing to latch on to any piece of evidence, however specious, to make that argument. This reflex was also at play in Lopez Obrador's dismissal of reporting from Reforma, a Monterrey newspaper that is typically opposed to his administration, on the violence in December. Unfortunately, Lopez Obrador's preferred results do not appear to match developments, whether in security or energy. This governing style can be typical of populist leaders and Lopez Obrador is hardly the first to use such posturing. However, these stances, if not corrected, can become dangerous rather than just merely embarrassing. Second, the enduringly high murder rate highlights Mexico's long-term security problems. Lopez Obrador proposed a wide variety of fixes during the campaign, ranging from rhetorical shifts ( hugs instead of bullets , went one informal slogan) to institutional changes like the new National Guard. But stemming violence in Mexico does not lend itself to easy fixes, and Lopez Obrador's ideas have fallen short of a revolutionary departure from the policies of prior presidents. Any enduring improvement will be the product of a years-long evolution and coordination between federal, state and local authorities, not any rapid reversal from one week to the next. Lopez Obrador's willingness to indulge in the wild conjecture that he has engineered a sudden transformation is a sign that he has yet to appreciate the depth of the challenges he faces."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Drug Traffickers Upping Use of El Salvador Maritime Routes. Drug traffickers are reportedly increasing their use of maritime routes to carry cocaine through El Salvador, a sign that criminals continue to adapt in accordance with interdiction efforts. Starting in 2014, El Salvador began seeing a shift from land-based drug smuggling to maritime smuggling, the country's Anti-Narcotics Division Head Marco Tulio Lima told El Salvador.com. Lima attributed this to increased drug detection capabilities at border crossings, such as X-ray machines, and to El Salvador's limited control over its surrounding waters. While most ships carrying large drug shipments travel 250 to 450 nautical miles off the coast, Salvadoran authorities are only able to patrol roughly 20 nautical miles off the coast. Despite these limitations, between February and April authorities seized a total of 1,069 kilos of cocaine off of small boats, and captured numerous local and foreign drug traffickers, Lima said. In the isthmus, illegal drugs have long moved mostly via the sea. According to El Salvador officials, 89 percent of drugs reaching the United States and Canada travel through maritime routes. A recent book on the subject entitled Mares de Cocaina (Seas of Cocaine) echoes the claim, and a section of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's latest report also highlights the importance of maritime drug trafficking. This tendency may increase in the near future. With more radar and air interdiction capabilities , flying drugs through Central America is becoming harder. Meanwhile land shipments may be getting easier to detect, as Lima suggested. Additionally, carrying drugs over land generally requires the involvement of other criminal groups, which also increases the cost of smuggling and the chances of betrayal. What's more, authorities have always had a hard time policing the sea. Large-scale maritime interdiction efforts, including ongoing programs like the United States-led Operation Martillo , have failed to stem the tide. Despite the uptick, do not expect El Salvador to become a drug trafficking haven like some of its neighbors. With high population density and a short coastline, El Salvador remains a poor-man's hub when it comes to drug trafficking.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"UN Says Colombia Coca Cultivation Down by 25%. The annual United Nations report on coca cultivation in Colombia shows the number of hectares cultivated has dropped by a quarter, although this does not necessarily translate into a drop in cocaine production. The area of coca cultivation dropped from 64,000 hectares in 2011 to 48,000 in 2012, according to the United Nations Office On Drugs and Crime (UNODC). (See full report in PDF ) Throughout the year, Colombian authorities aerially eradicated 100,549 hectares and manually eradicated a further 34,486, the report said. This, when taking into account replanting in certain areas, reduced the area affected by cultivation from an estimated 135,000 to the final 48,000 figure by the end of the year. Coca crops are now present in 23 of Colombia's 32 states or departments, as they are known in Colombia, but 80 percent of cultivation is concentrated in eight departments and around 50 percent in three departments. While production fell in 17 departments, it grew in the guerrilla strongholds of Norte de Santander and Caqueta. It also rose in Choco, where both guerrilla groups and the drug trafficking paramilitary successor groups known as the BACRIM (from the Spanish ""bandas criminales"" or ""criminal bands"") operate. The ""farm-gate"" value of coca leaf and derivatives -- cocaine base and paste -- was estimated at $370 million, a drop from 2011 estimates, which stood at $422 million. Prices for base, paste and powdered cocaine remained mostly stable, seeing just small fluctuations. The average gross income for a coca farmer was estimated at $1,220 for the year, with 60 percent of coca farmers financially dependent on the crop -- down from 82 percent in 2005. Around 30 percent of coca farmers are believed to also be involved in processing coca leaf into cocaine base. Calculations for total cocaine production remain stable and were estimated at 309 tons. Colombia Coca Crops (Source: UNODC) The UNODC figures appear to show substantial gains for the Colombian government in its battle to eradicate coca crops. However, there are several complicating factors that may mean the drop in cultivation has not necessarily resulted in an equivalent drop in cocaine production. Put simply, the question is: how are estimates for cocaine production relatively stable while those for cultivation have dropped by a quarter? One of these is the number of yields per year. While the UN notes annual yields have been falling since 2005, it offers no precise figures, and in some areas coca crops are known to now produce up to six yields a year. Another factor is the introduction of superior coca strains, which has higher alkaloid content and so can produce more cocaine per ton of leaf. Higher yield means less area needs to be cultivated to produce similar total amounts. Lastly, there are questions about the methodology of the study. It is well known that the aerial photographs are taken on the last two days of the year, and, as La Silla Vacia points out , the Colombian government concentrates its eradication efforts during the period leading up to these photos, effectively skewing the results."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Militarys Rights Abuses Go Unpunished: Report. A new report provides another strong argument against Mexico's use of military to fight organized crime. However, like earlier investigations on the issue, its findings fly in the face of a stark political reality: the Mexican people continue to ask for the army to save them. The 42-page document by the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego, entitled ""Armed with Impunity,"" (see pdf ) treads some of the same ground as previous reports on this matter, but it does offer some precise and salient points for anyone seeking to understand this complex and politically-charged issue, especially as the country prepares to usher in a new president in December. Among the report's most important conclusions are: - The military's abuses against civilians often go unpunished. - The government needs to enforce recent changes in Mexican law in order to give preeminence to international legal treatment of the use of civilian courts to judge military personnel. - The government needs to reduce its reliance on the military in its fight against organized crime. - The government needs to strengthen the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH), the only body that has chronicled the military's abuses in Mexico. None of these changes will be easy to implement, especially considering that the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto has indicated that he will continue using the military to fight organized crime, if not expand its role. What's more, as the report makes clear, the military's involvement in security matters goes well beyond the government's use of the army and the navy to take over defunct police units and areas where security forces are being outmatched and overwhelmed. And it began well before current President Felipe Calderon deployed close to 50,000 troops to different violence-plagued areas. By the end of the 1990s, military personnel ran 28 of the country's 32 state police commands, and continue to be the default answer to poor police leadership. They have been asked to join the National Public Security Council, which deals with domestic law enforcement issues, and have been Attorneys General. This is not just a question of human rights or rule of law. Reform is a political and financial question for these institutions. The report, for instance, notes that the army has doubled in size in the last three decades, and the military's budget has increased fourfold since 1996, going up six percent since Calderon took power in December 2006. Beyond the question of resources is the political calculus that any incoming president would make. As it is in most of the world, these decisions are often based on polls, and the polls do not favor withdrawing the military from conflict-ridden areas. To be sure, the military is consistently ranked alongside the church as the country's most respected institution. In the Pew Research Center's ""Global Attitudes Project,"" the military received 83 percent and 80 percent ""support"" from respondents in 2011 and 2012, respectively, when asked about its role in fighting organized crime. The Trans-Border Institute authors say that this popularity, in part, has to do with the fact that many poor and rural families populate the military's ranks. They add that the Mexican army has long been the default solution during crises, from floods to public protests. ""As a result, in public opinion polls measuring levels of trust, the military is typically ranked higher than any other government institution, and is widely perceived to be the best hope for promoting law and order in Mexico,"" the report says. What's more, drawing from CNDH data, the authors say that the military's abuses are concentrated in two areas: Chihuahua and Michoacan states. Both these areas have seen notable declines in abuse cases since abuse allegations peaked in 2009, leading the authors to posit a number of theories. ""This trend may indicate that the scaling back of military involvement in key cities, such as Chihuahua, has helped to reduce the number of violations by military personnel,"" they write. ""It may also reflect the fact that the military has actually attempted to prevent further violations, based on CNDH recommendations and scrutiny from human rights organizations. However, a less rosy view is that perhaps military human rights violators have gotten better at concealing abuses."" No more is mentioned about this ""less rosy"" view, and that's where the report falls flat. So-called ""aggressors"" have been killed by security forces during ""confrontations"" at an increasingly worrying rate. As chronicled in this InSight Crime story , the number of dead ""aggressors"" rose from 231 in 2007 to 2,099 in 2010, the last year the government released data on this issue. These ""confrontations"" happen in both urban and rural areas, with no discernible geographic pattern. The more important aspect of these ""battles"" is that there is only one witness -- the military -- and therefore only one account of what happened. This trend does not appear to be abating, and neither the Attorney General's Office or the CNDH have the means, the political capital or the will to delve into these battle scenes in the moments after they happen. The authors' failure to explore cases in which so-called ""aggressors"" are killed is part of a larger, more disturbing story. At the heart of this story is an attitude, reflected from the top down in Mexican politics, military and society, that those who die must have done something to deserve it. Until that attitude changes, there is little chance the military will be held accountable for its abuses against civilians. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Police Operation Against Cuchillo. This video from the Colombian National Police shows operation codenamed ""Diamond,"" which was designed to kill or capture Pedro Guerrero Castillo, alias "" Cuchillo ."" ""Diamond"" was launched on Christmas Eve, with 200 police commandos attacking a farmhouse in a rural area of Mapiripan, Meta, in the Eastern Plains of Colombia. There they ran into resistance from Guerrero's criminal group, the Popular Revolutionary Antiterrorist Army of Colombia ( ERPAC ). Two policemen were killed in a gun battle that lasted 20 minutes along with one ERPAC bodyguard. There were seven arrests, among them the ERPAC second-in-command, Harold Humberto Rojas, alias ""El Loco Harold."" Cuchillo managed to escape but according to the police fell into a river and drowned. His body was recovered several days later. The questions now are who will succeed Guerrero and will the ERPAC, an organization that has as many as 1,200 armed soldiers at the ready and is one of the country's principal drug trafficking organizations, remain intact.

"Venezuela Govt Proposes Arming Civilians to Combat Crime. Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro announced a new package of anti-crime measures that includes giving arms to civilians and charging supervised groups with gathering intelligence, raising concerns over possible human rights abuses and arbitrary actions on behalf of the state. ""Only the people can save the people I call on everyone, with all the strength of Venezuela, with all our abilities, to rise up,"" the president said in a radio and television broadcast, Panorama reported. As part of the ""Carobobo Campaign 2021,"" the new set of measures looks to initiate simultaneous actions from the military, police and civilian populations. Two of the most controversial measures are the arming of civilians and the strengthening of an intelligence system within neighborhoods known as SP3, which is controlled by the government. SP3 aims to identify criminal groups and paramilitaries with the help of civilian informers, known as ""cooperating patriots."" Operation Humanist Liberation of the People (Operacion Liberacion Humanista del Pueblo - OLHP) -- previously known as the Operation Liberation of the People (Operacion para la Liberacion del Pueblo - OLP) -- is considering a massive deployment of government forces to seek out and neutralize criminals while remaining in the communities after the operation has ended. Maduro's announcement was preceded by military exercises in which the president announced plans to deliver arms to communities in order to defend Venezuela 's sovereignty, El Nuevo Herald reported. The call for Venezuelan citizens to rise up in hopes of eradicating crime in the country is nothing new. The government already has so-called ""colectivos"" -- armed left-wing civilian groups which have been allowed, and sometimes encouraged, to take over urban communities in west Caracas. Investigations by InSight Crime have found that these groups, who claim to be protecting communities , actually exert violence, threaten, extort and intimidate the population. Given this precedent, it's possible that the president's new plan will strengthen these groups and promote the creation of new ones, possibly increasing violence. Reported human rights abuses and concerns from security experts were not enough to discredit the OLP. The only proposed solution from the government was a simple name change that added the word ""humanist."" For now, no change has been proposed to specifically reduce crime. In the past, Chavismo executed similar plans without having any lasting results. In their end-of-year report , the Venezuelan Violence Observatory (Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia - OVV) estimated that there were 28,479 ""violent deaths"" in 2016, accounting for a violent death rate of 91.8 per 100,000, an increase from the 82 violent deaths per 100,000 reported in 2015."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Do People in Venezuela Support Civilian or Military Policing?Since our last article in this series there have been significant changes in the administration of citizen security in Venezuela. The murder of actress Monica Spear and her husband last month effectively provided the occasion for the Maduro government to accentuate the militarization of the administration of citizen security, replacing civilians with military officers both at the helm of the National Experimental Security University (UNES) -- where security forces receive training -- and the National Bolivarian Police (PNB). This means that the entire citizen security apparatus is now directed by retired or active military officers. What do citizens think about the armed forces in citizen security functions? In Datanalisis' September-October tracking poll we asked respondents: Among the following options, which makes you feel the safest? This article originally appeared on the Washington Office on Latin America blog Venezuela Politics and Human Rights. See original article here. The results are clear and remarkable. Respondents preferred the National Guard to the police by a ratio of 4:1 (57 percent versus 14 percent). Furthermore, almost twice as many respondents preferred the presence of neither to the presence of the police (27 percent versus 14 percent). Despite the National Guard's reputation for being heavily armed but lightly trained, and the excessive use of force this frequently leads to, people clearly prefer them over the police. This should not be taken as an indictment of the PNB since, thus far, they have only been deployed to eight states (including the capital, Caracas) and have around 15,000 officers working in the entire country. This can be compared with the Metropolitan Police that, before being disbanded, had about 10,000 officers working in Caracas alone. Rather, this demonstrates the distrust that decades of corrupt and abusive police have generated. Political scientist Ana Maria Sanjuan, a leading authority on citizen security and policing in Venezuela, suggests there are several factors at work. She suggests that people see career police officers as corrupt, abusive and frequently in cahoots with criminals. They fear that approaching them to report a crime would most likely lead to harassment and extortion rather than protection. In contrast, while National Guard troops are heavily armed, they are generally on brief rotations in any given sector and therefore less likely to create durable networks with criminals. And while they do not have extensive training, average people see them as more honest and less likely to harass them. How do people see the effectiveness of the PNB? On the survey respondents were asked: Do you agree with the following statement? The National Bolivarian Police is the security body most capable of combating security. Almost half of respondents do not perceive the PNB as the most capable police force, compared to 30 percent who do. When we break this down by political affiliation, we see a clear division between government supporters and the opposition. 56 percent of government supporters were in agreement, compared to 9 percent of opposition supporters. In contrast, 81 percent of opposition supporters disagreed with the statement compared to only 21 percent of government supporters disagreeing. There are two possible explanations for the importance of political affiliation in this data. First, the PNB and the UNES are both identified with the Chavez and now Maduro government. Thus those who oppose the government are more likely to oppose its initiatives. Second, and more generously, the popular sectors that most support the government are also the places where the PNB have been deployed most intensively. Thus it could be that people with more contact with the PNB have a more positive view of its effectiveness. What do citizens think would make police more effective? The following question was included on the September-October survey: In your opinion, in order for our police officers to be more capable of fighting crime, what is the first thing that needs to happen? Respondents were given six options: More training in the protection of human rights, better training, better job conditions (salary and benefits), a better functioning judicial system, better equipment, and more freedom in using force when confronting criminals. Surprisingly, the response that receives most support is the idea of receiving more human rights training, narrowly edging out ""better training"" and ""better job conditions,"" although still receiving less than a quarter of all the responses. Interestingly, here there is agreement across political lines. When broken down by affiliation, 22.9 percent of government supporters and 22.8 percent of the opposition believe that more training in human rights is the first thing that needs to happen to improve the police's ability to fight crime. ""Freedom to use force"" received less than 10 percent of responses. However it is important to realize that the question was what needs to be done to make the police more effective. Many people probably think use of force is important, but simply do not think the police need more freedom to use it. The responses to these three survey questions provide a complex portrait. Venezuelans are still overwhelmingly dissatisfied with their police forces and trust the National Guard much more. Furthermore, the newly created PNB has not fully convinced people of their effectiveness, a perception that is affected by Venezuela's political polarization. However, the data show broad support for better trained and better paid police forces, and most particularly for human rights training. *This article originally appeared on the Washington Office on Latin America blog Venezuela Politics and Human Rights.

"100+ Venezuela Security Officials Accused of Extortion. Over 100 Venezuelan security officials have been linked to extortion this year, a reflection of the nation's crumbling state and dire economic situation. Some 38 extortion cases involving 121 security force members were reported in Venezuela between January 1 and September 3, according to El Nacional. The actual number, however, is believed to be much higher as extortion is one of the least reported crimes, the Venezuelan newspaper added. In total, agents from 15 security force branches were implicated. Most represented was Venezuela's investigative police agency (CICPC) with 46 members, followed by the Bolivarian National Police (PNB) with 26 members. Highlighted cases included police holding citizens' vehicles for ransom and arresting people when extortion payments were not met. According to Sergio Gonzalez, the former head of CICPC internal investigations, extortion has always been common among Venezuela security forces, but has increased recently with degenerating economic conditions and poor recruiting practices, reported El Nacional. ""Unfortunately we don't see commitment in the new agents. It looks like they're only after the money,"" Gonzalez was quoted as saying. Allegations of corruption at even the highest levels of Venezuela's government is not uncommon. But unlike drug trafficking carried out by military personnel -- frequently referred to as the ""Cartel of the Suns"" -- extortion by security forces appears linked to the nation's struggling economy and government. In 2011, Venezuela disbanded the Caracas Metropolitan Police as part of reforms aimed at tackling police corruption. Despite such efforts, security forces -- particularly the PNB and the CICPC -- have since been accused of committing crimes like extortion, kidnapping , and grisly extra-judicial killings. The problem seems to stem in large part from Venezuela's troubles with training and paying police , including a reported seven-month period in 2014 when police received no pay at all. It thus appears some officers are coping by using their position to commit crimes to help offset poor wages. Unfortunately, Venezuela's suffering economy has left the government -- which often appears more interested in political posturing than real police reform -- with scant resources to remedy the situation. Instead of meaningfully addressing failed policies, the Venezuelan government has taken to blaming neighboring Colombia for both its economic and security woes. With real reform in either arena unlikely, as Venezuela's economy collapses and hyper-inflation takes its toll police corruption will likely only continue to worsen."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Clandestine Airstrips, Drug Flights Becoming More Frequent Across Venezuela. Clandestine airstrips found in Venezuela and suspected drug flights leaving the country soared in 2019, with different parts of the country being used as aerial connection points, but the total amounts may still be far higher than previously thought. According to figures from the Venezuelan government, 23 light aircraft and 36 clandestine runways used for drug trafficking were either confiscated or destroyed in 2019. But other groups monitoring the situation claim that the country has far more illegal runways and that planes carrying drugs are seen on a daily basis. National Assembly representative Juan Pablo Guanipa was quoted by El Universal as saying that 400 such runways exist in the state of Zulia alone, where members of state security forces and of criminal groups allegedly force landowners to let them build landing strips. ""If we denounce them, they jail us, or we simply have to leave the farm because of the threats,"" one farmer in Zulia told El Pitazo. One of the states where instances of landing strips and clandestine flights are most reported is Zulia. Located to the west of the country, bordering Colombia, the state is strategically located due to its proximity to Catatumbo, where coca production has increased. Of the 36 clandestine runways destroyed by armed forces by August 2019, 31 were located in Zulia , according to Venezuela government statements. Beyond Zulia, InSight Crime has identified another five states where national and local media reports where the existence of clandestine runways or seizures of drug flights have been reported: Apure, Amazonas , Falcon , Guarico and Cojedes. One Venezuelan pilot, Yazenky Antonio Lamas Rondon, who used to work for Venezuela's first lady Cilia Flores and has since been extradited from Colombia to the United States, reportedly flew ""over 100 drug flights"" from the state of Apure to the Caribbean for a decade, El Espectador reported. And in 2019, Spanish thinktank El Cano Royal Institute showed frequent drug flight connections from the Colombian departments of Guaviare, Guainia, Meta, Vichada and Arauca to the Venezuelan state of Apure. Meanwhile, the central state of Guarico is reportedly being used to house some of the light aircraft used for these drug flights, according to El Pitazo. Over the last six years, a number of small planes have been seized in the national park of Aguaro Guariquito, where drug traffickers are believed to be modifying aircraft to allow them to carry heavier payloads. Drug flights from Venezuela are bound for much of Latin America and the Caribbean, with evidence of them landing in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Belize and even Mexico, as observed in distinct cases reported by CNN , El Heraldo and El Universal. Given Venezuela's importance for transnational drug trafficking and the plethora of criminal groups involved in this criminal economy, the highest estimates for the number of drug flights and airstrips may be falling short. Drug flights departed Venezuela every two days in 2017 and on a daily basis in 2018, according to statements made to CNN by a US government official. In 2019, this increased to five overnight flights departing Venezuela on the same day. Residents of Apure and southern Zulia have told InSight Crime that they frequently see small aircrafts flying overhead. Additionally, the presence of clandestine runways at many of the local farms is an open secret. The role played by current or former members of the Venezuela armed forces is also worthy of note. In November 2019, an air force captain, Gino Alfonso Garces Vergara, was linked to a complex drug trafficking plot involving who collaborated with Colombian and Mexican cartels, in a joint investigation conducted by Colombian police and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). And in December 2019, Guatemala shot down a plane loaded with drugs that was illegally entering the country. The pilot, who was killed, was identified as Lino Nevado Sthormes, a former Venezuelan Air Force pilot from Maracaibo, in the state of Zulia."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Mexico Cartels Stealing Gold to Launder Drug Money. Mexican authorities say that, since 2008, criminal gangs have robbed so many trucks carrying gold shipments that some mining companies have been forced to switch to aerial transportation. This highlights the convenience of gold as a means to launder dirty cash. Drug cartels primarily use the gold to launder their proceeds, usually reworking it into jewelery and selling it on the legal market, reports Excelsior. Theft of gold bar shipments has been reported in some of the states most affected by drug violence, including Chihuahua, Sonora, and Durango. One miners' association in Sonora told the newspaper that their production costs have increased 15 percent due to security problems, and because they are forced to move their product mostly by plane. The report does not provide a total for the number of such robberies registered in the past four years, but says the gold stolen during that period is worth some $3 million. The Attorney General's Office reportedly has seven open investigations into gold robberies, all of which involve drug trafficking groups. Some organizations even have the technology to melt down the stolen gold and recast it into bars with a higher level of purity, the report reveals. Gold has various advantages that are appealing to money launderers, including its easy convertibility, and the fact that it can be transferred with relative anonymity on the world market. Both Colombia's Cali and Medellin Cartels favored gold as a way to launder the proceeds of drug trafficking. It is typically used a means to transfer money from drug sales in the US back to the cartel's country of origin. There are a couple of ways such laundering schemes could work. One is buying gold with dirty cash, and reworking the metal so that it is disguised as a common household or fashion item, then exporting this back to the drug cartel's home country, refining it, and selling it for cash. Another method involves exchanging cash for gold, and using the gold itself to represent the proceeds gained from drug trafficking. A popular method used by the Medellin Cartel involved importing bars of gold mixed with lead, which were reported as fine gold. By overcharging for the low-purity gold and fudging the invoices, the cartel was able to disguise its profits. It is likely that the Mexican cartels are also employing a wide variety of ways to use gold to launder proceeds from organized crime. The fact that the Mexican groups have elected to steal the gold outright, rather than purchasing it from legitimate jewelry sellers as the Colombian cartels used to , is one sign of the boldness of the Mexican criminal syndicates. It could also be that stealing gold shipments is viewed as easier and more convenient than going through the hassle of building a relationship with a supplier, which could explain why some Mexican groups have elected to use theft as their primary means of obtaining gold. 	0	0	0	0	1	1	0
"Mexican Cartels Move into Prescription Pill Market. US authorities have reported the rise of a new breed of ""pharma cartels"" in Mexico, which sell illicitly obtained prescription drugs to buyers in the United States, and pay fees to traditional drug trafficking groups. According to an October 4 press release from the US Attorney's Office in southern California , Mexican drug trafficking organizations are moving into the lucrative black market for prescription drugs in the US. These organizations, many of which are based over the border from California in Tijuana, use the Internet to sell painkillers such as OxyContin and Vicodin to clients in the United States, often making hundreds of thousands of dollars a month in profits. US Attorney Laura E. Duffy told NBC San Diego that in addition to diverting drugs from hospitals and pharmacies, some pharma-cartels create their own versions of painkillers in makeshift laboratories. Traditional cartels have begun charging these new groups money in exchange for allowing them to operate. While Mexico's traditional drug cartels have so far focused on taxing existing pharma-cartels rather than entering the market themselves, the shifting nature of the US drug market suggests that this could change as the market for prescription pills grows. The most recent US National Survey on Drugs , released in September 2012, reported that 6.1 million US citizens, or 2.4 percent of the population aged 12 or older, used prescription pills non-medically in 2011. While this is a slight decrease from the previous year, these numbers indicate that prescription pill abuse is now the second most prevalent form of illicit drug use in the United States after marijuana. As prescription drug abuse has become more common, cocaine use in the United States has fallen from 2.4 million users in 2006 to 1.4 million users in 2012. While the user populations are probably different (cocaine users are unlikely to be switching over to painkillers), this shift does have serious implications for Mexican cartels, who depend on cocaine profits as their top source of income. As cocaine use drops, and as US authorities try to tamp down on prescription drug abuse by strengthening enforcement at clinics and pharmacies, traditional drug cartels may try to muscle in on the market further."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Sinaloa Trafficker Complains of Conditions in Chicago Jail. A high ranking member of Mexico 's Sinaloa Cartel , imprisoned in the United States, has won concessions after complaining about harsh conditions in the Chicago prison where he is being held. A U.S. judge ruled Thursday that Jesus Vicente Zambada Niebla, alias ""Vicentillo,"" be allowed outdoor exercise at Chicago's Metropolitan Correctional Center while he awaits trial. Zambada has been denied outdoor exercise for the entirety of the 18 months he has been incarcerated, with prison officers citing security concerns. During this time, he has been kept in isolation from the rest of the prison population in a solitary confinement area for high-risk prisoners. Zambada will now be allowed exercise time on a prison rooftop. However the new warden at the prison, Catherine Linaweaver, has expressed concerns at the judge's ruling. Linawever has pointed to the risk of the prisoner being assassinated or attempting to escape. She has also criticized the cost and effort required to provide specially trained staff to guard Zambada. Zambada is the son of Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias "" El Mayo ,""a top leader in the Sinaloa Cartel. He was arrested in 2010 and is awaiting trial on charges of trafficking tons of drugs into the Chicago area. His defense team contend that he trafficked drugs into the U.S. with the full knowledge and permission of U.S. law enforcement in a deal where he provided information on rival cartels in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

"Mexico Continues Hunt for Veteran Drug Lord Caro Quintero. Mexico authorities continue their hunt for veteran drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, alleging the man known as the ""narco of narcos"" is linked to drug trafficking and resurgent violence in the state of Sinaloa. Officials in Mexico's Defense ministry (Secretaria de la Defensa Nacional, SEDENA) say their intelligence shows that Caro Quintero's relatives remain active in the trafficking of marijuana, opium gum and methamphetamine in the area between Badriguato, state of Sinaloa, and Tamazula, in the state of Durango, reported Zeta magazine. The officials say the former head of the long-defunct Guadalajara Cartel who spent some 30 years in prison is running those illegal operations. This region was considered the domain of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, the head of the Sinaloa Cartel who was most recently arrested in early 2016. El Chapo is now awaiting extradition to the US in a jail close the border. Since April, there has been an increase in murders in the Sinaloa cities of Culiacan, Mazatlan and Navolato. The uptick in violence has been attributed to the loosening of El Chapo's control over the region. Police have said groups of armed men have been patrolling the streets of the state capital, Culiacan, Tijuana-based Zeta reported. Caro Quintero is considered by many to be the godfather of drug trafficking in Mexico. He was one of the nation's most powerful drug traffickers before going to prison in 1989 for drug trafficking and for the abduction, torture, and murder of Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena, an agent for the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Caro Quintero was released in 2013 on a technicality. Officials promptly called for his recapture, and the United States offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest. The search for Caro Quintero was previously overshadowed by the summer 2015 escape, for the second time, of El Chapo. But it appears that Mexico's military has refocused its efforts on recapturing the veteran drug trafficker. On The Navy launched an operation in several communities in the area on June 13 aimed at finding Caro Quintero. Zeta reported that some residents were beaten and harassed in the operation. Security officials accuse Caro Quintero as reintegrating himself into the drug trade and taking over illegal activity in territory once dominated by El Chapo. Caro Quintero recently resurfaced to deny these allegations in a secretly recorded interview with Mexico's Proceso magazine. He denied having problems with anyone except the authorities, whom he offered an apology for past offenses. He claimed that El Chapo was his friend, and that he had nothing to do with Camarena's 1985 murder. Despite his claims to have left the illegal life behind, capturing Caro Quintero will continue to be a priority for both Mexican and US officials, whether he is back in violent business or not."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Questioning the Theory that Distracted Army Equals More Drugs. The Washington Post argues that Mexico's policy of deploying the military to address violence and insecurity has taken the focus off efforts to eradicate illegal marijuana and poppy cultivation, but the criticism is based on flawed premises. The Post ties recent increases in domestic marijuana and poppy production to President Felipe Calderon's militarized security strategy. Mexico's long-standing eradication policy primarily relied on military personnel to manually eliminate illicit crops. Over the past five years, as Calderon deployed the armed forces to the country's most violent areas, often replacing Mexico's notoriously corrupt civil police forces on the front lines of the fight against drug cartels, fewer troops are available to focus on crop eradication. According to the article, the acreage dedicated to growing marijuana doubled during the same period (see Congressional Research Service report on this subject in pdf here ), while poppy cultivation doubled in just one year, between 2007 and 2008. Mexico's decreased attention to eradication has caused concern amongst drug enforcement officials in the United Nations, who say the increasing availability of heroin on U.S. markets signals Mexico's importance as both a transit and source country for illegal drugs, especially as production declines in Colombia. Others, such as the researcher Vanda Felbab-Brown at Brookings, are concerned that Mexico has not replaced eradication efforts with alternative livelihood programs that would incentivize the cultivation of legal crops in the country's impoverished, remote drug production zones (see Felbab-Brown's recent testimony touching on this subject here in pdf ). Although supply-side interventions may not be Calderon's top priority, the article points to a causal effect between reduced eradication*and a surge in cultivation: If Mexico's armed forces had not been redeployed to wage war against the drug cartels, manual eradication efforts would have reduced (or maintained) the*supply of illicit poppy and marijuana crops. However,*the United Nations documented increased poppy cultivation beginning in 2000 (see report here in pdf ) and the spike in marijuana cultivation was first seen in 2006, according to a 2010 U.S. Justice Department report. Mexico's control over the supply of heroin in the U.S. has expanded over three decades, and the country now produces an estimated 39 percent of the total. Mexico's share of the U.S. drug supply market has been growing for years, long before any major troop redeployment by President Calderon, meaning that the country's eradication policy only partially explains supply market trends. There are a number of other factors that affect drug supply in Mexico, not the least of which is demand for drugs. Many of the factors that influence whether an individual farmer will cultivate illicit crops are affected by unique socio-economic conditions. Farmers in remote, sparsely populated areas often lack access to legal markets because of rural underdevelopment. It would be illogical to invest time and labor into the cultivation of perishible food crops without ready access to markets where product can be sold quickly. In contrast, drug trafficking networks are able to purchase illicit products directly at the farm-gate. Drug production is also highly profitable. For example, poppy can be harvested in successive growing seasons and is less labor intensive than many legal crops. When factoring in market access and profit potential,*the decision to grow poppy may be the most logical. U.S. officials interviewed for the Post article praised Colombia's eradication policy, linking recent data regarding the higher price of cocaine per gram to eradication efforts that destroyed 146,000 hectares of coca plant in the country last year (an assessment that will have more than one researcher scratching their head). What's more, the Post's article makes an underlying assumption that the market for drugs is increasing by the same rate as that of production. In reality, the number of hardcore and moderate drug users in the U.S. has changed very little during the last three decades and, although demand has experienced minor fluctuations during this time, the price of drugs has trended downward, while purity has risen. Despite the virtual duopoly formed by suppliers in Mexico*and Colombia, centralized distribution and large-scale supply networks have ensured that illicit drugs continue to be widely available on the U.S. market. Stability in the U.S. demand market raises questions about the reliability of production statistics on Mexico. Why would producers inflate the supply of illicit drugs without corresponding demand? While emerging European and domestic markets may justify small increases over production for the U.S. market, supply still far exceeds demand. The statistics have been questioned by officials in Mexico, including one who told InSight that the U.S. and UN overestimated *production statistics in what may, unfortunately, be a political ploy intended to sustain supply-side intervention policies. Finally, the Post article makes no mention of the questionable effectiveness of eradication policies, which have significant unintential consequences. In a devastating demonstration of what's know as the balloon effect , Mexico's poppy growers have taken over for Colombia's heroin producers, just as decreasing coca production in Colombia has been accompanied by increasing production in Peru. 	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Guatemala ex-VP Arrested, President Implicated in Scandal. Guatemala's top prosecutors say that President Otto Perez Molina was involved in a massive customs fraud scandal, the same day that former Vice President Roxana Baldetti was arrested for her alleged role in the network. Baldetti was placed under arrest while staying at one of Guatemala's largest hospitals, where she checked in on August 16, reported elPeriodico. She was arrested on several charges related to a massive customs fraud scandal known as La Linea. Baldetti's private secretary, Juan Carlos Monzon, is accused of heading the criminal network, which primarily involved Guatemala's customs agency and dozens of collaborators. Ivan Velasquez, the head of Guatemala anti-impunity commission the CICIG, commented that he believed a congressional grand jury was warranted, in order to determine if there is enough evidence to remove Perez Molina's presidential immunity. Investigations unveiled that repeated references to alias ""number one"" and ""number two"" in wiretapped conversations between La Linea participants were likely alluding to Perez Molina and Baldetti respectively, Velasquez and Attorney General Thelma Aldana said during a August 21 press conference. Specifically, the prosecutors said that the leader of La Linea -- Baldetti's private secretary -- answered to them. ""On top of Juan Carlos Monzon, we found in the structure of La Linea the President -- Perez Molina -- and Roxana Baldetti -- the former Vice President,"" Aldana said. When the press asked the president about the possibility of a congressional grand jury, he replied simply , ""We have to see what this is all about."" Asked if he would resign, Perez Molina said, ""We are facing up to this."" The president has already faced one bid to strip him of his political immunity, which failed. His term ends in January 2016. After a nearly yearlong investigation spearheaded by the CICIG and the Attorney General's Office (known in Guatemala as the Public Ministry), authorities made the first wave of arrests in connection to La Linea in April. Public outcry about corruption in the country led to several massive anti-government protests, leading up to Baldetti's resignation in May. Since then, with few exceptions , she has mostly remained silent about the investigation, aside from denying the accusations leveled against her. The news comes just weeks before the first round of presidential elections, which remain a tightly fought three-way race. The second round run-off would be at the end of October, should no candidate reach the 50 percent threshold on September 6. If Perez Molina survives through the end of his term, his successor -- no matter the winner -- will have a difficult time rebuilding public confidence in the government, given how high this scandal has reached. It remains to be seen whether Baldetti still has the connections and the friends in high places needed to favorably influence the outcome of her case. She may also use her knowledge to take down the president, in order to try and save herself. Nevertheless, it's also possible that Guatemala's shadowy network of corrupt elites view coming to Baldetti's aid -- and possibly at this point, Perez Molina's -- as too risky a move. In some ways, Baldetti's downfall may have been inevitable, given the accusations of corruption and shady dealings that have dogged her throughout her political career. Nonetheless, her arrest undeniably further shakes up the status quo in Guatemala, which has been rocked by one corruption scandal after another thus far this year. Guatemala has long struggled with corrupt networks that have arguably turned the country into something like a mafia state. Notably, those involved in this most recent customs fraud scandal were practicing something very similiar to a previous crime ring, known as the Moreno network. Active from the 1970s until the 1990s, the Moreno group -- made up of corrupt military, police, and other government officials -- would steal contraband shipments and force their owners to pay a fee to get their goods back. As outlined in a 2003 report by the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), the Moreno group likely had connections to other corrupt cells of military officers -- known as CIACS by their Spanish acronym -- one of which may have involved Perez Molina. La Linea followed a similar modus operandi, except instead of stealing goods, they colluded with importers. In exchange for a bribe, they allowed importers to dodge the requisite taxes. It's estimated that those involved in La Linea earned hundreds of thousands of dollars per week this way. In some ways, La Linea operated similarly to the CIACS, except instead of corrupt security officers, the ring involved Guatemala's top economic and political influence peddlers. By pushing the Linea investigation to the highest levels of power, not only are investigators setting an important precedent for judicial independence, they are essentially unraveling the mafia-like networks that have sucked Guatemala dry for decades. While Guatemala's justice system has previously proven incapable of resisting political influence during high-profile trials, it may yet be that the case against Baldetti -- and whatever subsequent probe into Perez Molina -- could set a new standard for rule of law in the country."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Peruvian Police Arrest Ketamine Supplier. Police in Lima have reported capturing a small-time supplier of ketamine, highlighting the rising popularity of synthetic drugs in Peru. A video (watch below) shows undercover agents buying ketamine, a sedative used in veterinary medicine, in a busy shopping district in central Lima. The video shows two separate occasions in which agents bought ketamine from street dealers, who were getting their product from a stall selling pharmaceuticals in a shopping mall, as newspaper La Republica reports. Small bottles of the drug were offered to the undercover cops for 15 soles, almost $6. The end of the video shows one dealer openly injecting himself with the drug on the street. Ketamine has been a popular recreational drug in Europe and Asia for some years, and can be taken in liquid or powder form. According to press reports , it seems to have been available in Peru since at least 2010. The ketamine bust follows the recent seizure of thousands of synthetic drug capsules in Lima , including Ecstasy, MDMA, and 2CB -- stimulants and hallucinogens which are typically used by young people at nighclubs or raves, as is ketamine. The availability of such ""party pills"" is one indicator of the growing popularity of synthetic drugs in Latin America among the youth population. The recently-released 2013 International Narcotics Control Board report from the US State Department raised concerns about ""the spreading abuse of synthetic drugs in South America"" and ""the reported abuse of prescription drugs containing psychotropic substances"" among high school students. Ketamine is now reportedly available in Argentina, El Salvador and Uruguay as well as Peru, according to the United Nations 2012 World Drug Report. As reported by InSight Crime , the popularity of synthetic drugs has risen across the globe as production of traditional drugs such as cocaine and opium has fallen. Specially-manufactured drugs can avoid international sanctions and be sold as ""legal highs."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"UN Report Identifies Winners and Losers of Transnational Crime. According to a new report released by the United Nations, profits from criminal activities worldwide exceeded $2.1 trillion in 2009. But as a breakdown of this figure reveals, these profits vary widely across regions and criminal groups. As the report, by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, ( available here as a PDF ) points out, this represented 3.6 percent of global gross domestic product that year. Of this $2.1 trillion, the report's authors claim that some $870 billion is related to drug trafficking and organized crime. The majority of this sum ($580 billion) is laundered through various financial institutions. This clashes with the argument of analysts such as Alejandro Hope, who argue that the high operating costs of running a drug trafficking organization, combined with the fact that cash is more difficult to trace, makes it likely that drug gangs prefer to keep their funds in hard currency. The report's most interesting findings stem from its chosen case study: the money flows of the international cocaine trade. Unsurprisingly, those who cultivate the coca plant are at the bottom of the profit pyramid when it comes to cocaine. For their coca production, Andean farmers in Peru, Colombia and Bolivia collectively received just $1 billion in 2009, which amounts to slightly more than one percent of the $85 billion in total profits from the cocaine trade. In contrast, the majority (about $61 billion) in profits was generated inside the U.S. and Europe, which are the two largest markets for the drug in the world. The remaining money mostly came from transit costs and local demand. While the report does not go into details about the distribution of these proceeds, its authors claim that the largest portion goes to South American groups, most notably Colombia-based drug trafficking organizations, who are estimated to have made $3.3 billion from shipping the drug out of the region. If true, this illustrates the incentive for Mexicans to deepen their connections in producing countries, a phenomenon that InSight Crime has documented. But while Mexican drug trafficking groups still depend on Colombian counterparts to supply them with cocaine, they make up for the costs in the tremendous profits resulting from selling the drug to distributors in the United States. For just moving the drug across the border, drug trafficking organizations made an estimated $2 billion in 2009. It is estimated that another $5 billion in profits was generated by larger-scale drug cartels with their own distributors in the United States, such as the Zetas and Sinaloa Cartel The report's main argument, however, is that the importance of tracking illicit funds cannot be overstated. Calling for ""comprehensive, all inclusive participation"" in international anti-money laundering efforts, the authors argue that efforts at seizing illicitly made money may in the long run be more damaging to criminal infrastructures than taking down drug kingpins, as the latter are easily replaced. Unfortunately, the ability of law enforcement agencies around the world to identify and seize these illicit cash flows remains severely limited. The report estimates that less than one percent of illicit money is ever seized, meaning that money laundering remains an attractive and relatively easy option for transnational criminal groups.

"Last Months of Barbie. El Proceso magazine this week describes in detail the last months of Edgar Valdez Villareal, alias La Barbie , the former top hitman for the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) who was captured last week by Mexican authorities just outside Mexico City. Barbie's battles with Hector Beltran Leyva, alias El H , have left dozens of dead throughout the Acapulco - Cuernavaca corridor that was once the domain of Barbie's boss, Arturo Beltran Leyva, alias El Jefe de Jefes. Mexican Navy personnel gunned down Arturo in December, and four days later, El Proceso says, fighting began between Barbie and El H, who has since taken to calling his organization the South Pacific Cartel. Cuernavaca, the article alleges, is now in Hector's hands but Acapulco remains a battleground. ""We're waiting for you,"" a recent note on assassinated members of the security forces read, an apparent message to Hector and his top assassin, Sergio Villareal Barragan, alias El Grande to stay away from Acapulco. Other traffickers have taken advantage of the power vacuum including Ismael Zambada, alias El Mayo , a top member of the Sinaloa Cartel, who has apparently formed an alliance with Familia Michoacana to take control of the Costa Grande of Guerrero.

"El Chapo Probably Hiding in Sinaloa, Mexico: DEA. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) believes Mexico's fugitive drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman is likely hiding out in his home state of Sinaloa, as it offers him the best chance to avoid detection -- and return to power atop the Sinaloa Cartel. DEA chief Chuck Rosenberg told EFE that Sinaloa ""is where [El Chapo] would feel safest,"" since ""he has his family and his contacts there."" However, a DEA spokesperson said the US government has no concrete evidence Guzman is still in Mexico, reported EFE. Still, Rosenberg is right to point out that Chapo -- who was born in the Sinaloan mountain town of La Tuna and began his criminal career planting poppy and marijuana crops in the surrounding area as a teenager -- would feel most comfortable either operating or seeking refuge in Sinaloa. What's more, the behavior of other high-level criminal operators wanted by authorities also supports Rosenberg's theory. Many of Chapo's contemporaries in the region have chosen to stick close to their home territory when pursued by authorities, rather than fleeing abroad. In 2013, former Zetas leader Miguel Trevino, alias "" Z-40 ,"" was captured in Nuevo Laredo, his long-time base of operations. Likewise, in 2010 Victor Julio Suarez Rojas, alias "" Mono Jojoy ,"" a central figure in the drug trafficking operations of Colombian guerrilla group the FARC, was killed in a guerrilla stronghold in Colombia's Meta department. A more recent parallel is Dario Antonio Usuga, alias ""Otoniel,"" head of the Urabenos drug trafficking organization and currently Colombia's most wanted criminal. Despite significant efforts and resources deployed by the Colombian government, the former EPL guerrilla is believed to be operating out of his home base of Uraba in northwest Colombia. Taking refuge in Sinaloa would also provide El Chapo with the best opportunity to reclaim his position as the head the Sinaloa Cartel. A number of Sinaloa Cartel operatives are suspected of residing in Sinaloa, including cartel heavyweight Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias ""El Mayo,"" and it is where El Chapo could have the most control over drug trafficking operations. Nonetheless, El Chapo may yet present a unique case. Due to the extensive criminal networks Guzman built throughout Latin America on his way to becoming arguably the most prolific drug trafficker of all time , he may find other countries in the region -- most likely those comprising Central America's Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala) -- as a more attractive landing spot. Chapo Planning Narco-Meeting? Meanwhile, former DEA agent Hector Berrellez has also made headlines for his recent remarks about what Chapo could be planning since his dramatic jailbreak in early July. Berrellez told Mexican news outlet Reporte Indigo that he believes Chapo will meet with his former boss and legendary Mexican crime figure Rafael Caro Quintero, who is also suspected of hiding out in Sinaloa. ""To me, they are going to meet; that is, if they haven't already met up,"" Berrellez told Reporte Indigo. According to Berrellez, Guzman worked as a ""sicario,"" or hired killer, for the now-defunct Guadalajara Cartel, which Caro Quintero co-founded. On orders from Caro Quintero, Guzman participated in the murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena in 1985, Berrellez claimed. Caro Quintero was imprisoned in 1989 for drug trafficking, murder, and his role in the killing of Camarena. However, the kingpin was never sent to face justice in the United States, and US-Mexico relations surrounding extradition have been strained ever since. In many ways, the controversy over El Chapo's extradition -- which began as soon as he was captured in February 2014 -- is a result of the legal proceedings that took place decades ago regarding Camarena's case. Caro Quintero's early release from prison in 2013 on a technicality was heavily criticized by the United States , and further strained relations between the two countries. More Conspiracy Theories While past and current DEA officials have been hypothesizing about Chapo's whereabouts, the Mexican public remains skeptical about the government's version of how the drug lord escaped from prison. One popular theory states El Chapo fled prison after being tipped off about an impending extradition order to the United States. This theory was recently given further credence when El Chapo's lawyer stated the drug lord escaped when he did because he feared extradition. However, this seems unlikely given that experts believe the tunnel Chapo used to escape took months to build. Other theories accuse the Mexican government of releasing Chapo as part of a pre-arranged deal or in order to negotiate with other Mexican drug lords. Berrellez also claimed El Chapo enjoyed protection from the Mexican government, pointing out that authorities failed to seize any of his assets during the 16 months they had him in custody. No matter the validity of these theories, they speak to the profound distrust Mexicans have of their government, and even recapturing El Chapo might not be enough to win it back."	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Mexico Disappearances, Kidnappings Down, But Distrust Remains High. Kidnapping and disappearance cases in Mexico were down in 2015, but as continued accounts of government ineptitude and collusion surface, this change may simply signify decreased trust in government authorities. At a recent regional security meeting, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong reported that reported kidnapping cases were down 27 percent in 2015. Disappearances also decreased from an average of 14 a day in 2014, to 10 a day in 2015, according to government sources. Osorio Chong linked these improvements to ""the collaboration between regional governments and federal authorities."" In response to increased pressure related to the disappearance of 43 students in Iguala, Guerrero, in September 2014, Pena Nieto's government created a special office for disappearances and introduced a new law that details how all Mexican officials should respond to disappearances. Insight Crime Analysis Although at first glance, these numbers and government actions seem encouraging, there is a more troubling side to the story. In a recent report, Amnesty International (Al) chastised the Mexican government for its inaction in investigating disappearances. ""In most cases,"" AI wrote, ""investigation appears to consist of merely going through the motions and appears to be destined from the outset to lead nowhere."" AI noted that although the first 72 hours after a disappearance are key for gathering evidence, in none of the cases it analyzed did authorities take action in this time period. And, in many cases, when families finally accessed victims' files, there was no information beyond what the family had provided. There are many reasons that authorities do not pursue disappearance and kidnapping cases. Sometimes prosecutors are simply overworked and under-resourced. In other cases, police are intimidated by organized crime. In one instance reported by AI, a family member of a victim reported that a prosecutor showed him his paycheck and said, ""I'm not going to risk my life for that kind of money."" In addition, state actors themselves are involved in some disappearances and kidnappings. For example, authorities detained seven police officers in relation to recent disappearance of five young people in the state of Veracruz. On Tuesday, authorities found three bodies that may be related to this high-profile case, but for many of the families of the 27,600 disappeared people and countless kidnapping victims, they may never know where their loved ones are. In 2014, 92.8 percent of crimes were not reported in Mexico. And a decrease in official statistics of kidnappings and murder may simply signify a loss of hope in authorities, rather than increased investigative success."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Colombia Police Rescued Over 46,000 Illegally Trafficked Animals in 2012. More than 59,000 wild animals are illegally captured each year in Colombia and smuggled to Bogota, a city that has become a hub for the exotic species trade. In 2012 alone, Colombia's environmental police rescued 46,637 illegally trafficked animals , a trade that brings in about 64 billion pesos (about $35 million) a year, according to a report by Colombian daily ADN. Vendors paint the animals in bright colors and declaw them to make them more attractive to buyers, the ADN report highlights. Colombia's birds, snakes, and other exotic species are usually sold as pets, luxury food items, aphrodisiacs, or remedies in alternative medicine. According to ADN, the most frequently trafficked animals outside of Colombia include the orange-chinned parakeet (at least 400 rescued per year in Bogota), much in demand due to its ability to imitate speech, the ""icotea"" freshwater tortoise (350 rescued a year), and the yellow-crowned parrot (some 320 rescued per year). In one indication of the sheer size of Colombia's illicit wildlife trade, Bogota's main wildlife rehabilitation center reports receiving some 350 animals each month. Only about 15 percent of these are successfully reintegrated back into the wild. The rest stay in captivity, donated to zoos or parks. Not only do the illegally trafficked animals supply a domestic market within Colombia, they are also smuggled to Europe, the United States, and Asia. Worldwide, illegal animal sales garner some $20 billion a year, according to estimates by Interpol. Exotic animal trafficking is the world's third largest illicit trade after drug and weapons. In Colombia, the trade is particularly well established thanks to the biodiversity of areas like the Eastern Plains and the Amazon, which provide smugglers ready access to animals which fetch a high price in the global black market. Animal smugglers also rely on the same well-established movement corridors used to transport drug shipments, as a 2009 report by Reuters highlighted. Drug traffickers supplement their profits by taxing animal smugglers in exchange for using the same smuggling routes, or may even use the animals to help hide the drug shipments. Not only are animal and drug smuggling routes often the same, but drug leaders often use exotic beasts as power symbols. One Zetas leader, borrowing a page from Pablo Escobar's African hippos , allegedly housed two lions and a tiger on his ranch, where it was rumored he fed the animals with the bodies of his rivals."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Salvador Church Seeks Gang Agreement to Cut Extortion. After reportedly negotiating a gang ceasefire in El Salvador, the Church is now attempting to broker a reduction in criminal extortion, and the government says they are willing to facilitate the talks. Salvadoran Justice and Security Minister David Munguia Payes (pictured) has claimed that the Catholic Church is in the midst of expanding the truce it brokered between leaders of the MS-13 and Barrio 18 gangs to include address extortion. Although homicides have fallen dramatically since the truce was first announced in March, reports of extortion have continued and even risen in some departments, according to the country's attorney general. Transportation unions in particular have been hit especially hard by gang extortion. Straying from prior denials of government involvement in the negotiations, Munguia stated that the government is willing to facilitate the dialogue, saying ""the government cannot sit down to negotiate with criminal groups."" He qualified this, however, by saying that any concessions on the government's part will remain within the scope of the law. Currently, the government is considering some ""gestures of goodwill"" that gang leaders have requested, such as allowing imprisoned gangsters to be visited by their children, or lengthening the allowed time for conjugal visits. According to the minister, all the dialogue can do is ""create opportunities."" He remains hopeful that the reduction in homicides that resulted from the truce can be followed by a reduction in extortion, auto theft, and illicit arms acquisition. However, Munguia also cautioned that the government is prepared to seek other -- presumably more confrontational -- means of reducing gang activity if the negotiations fall through. The Salvadoran government's willingness to facilitate of the discussion between the Church and the country's two largest street gangs is a sign that the state has become more invested in the deal. Likewise, Munguia's announcement that the government will consider new concessions to curtail gang extortion also illustrates the gangs have fairly significant leverage in the negotiations. Minister Munguia appears optimistic that dialogue between the Church and the gang leaders will lead to a decline in criminal activity, but brokering a ceasefire between two gangs at war is very different from convincing them to abandon activities that fund their very existence. For this reason the results of negotiations are likely to be limited. In El Salvador and throughout the region, mediated truces between rival gangs have a poor track record , and the longevity of the current peace will probably not last. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"RawFeed: Controversial Prison Documentary Yanked in Mexico. Wednesday night a federal judge suspended all screenings of a controversial documentary film which tracks the failings of the Mexician criminal justice system. After being shown in international film festivals throughout 2010, ""Presumed Guilty"" was released in Mexico this year. The story of a young Mexican wrongfully sentenced and imprisoned for murder, the film has grossed about 18.5 million pesos (US$1.5 million) since opening on February 18, making it the most successful Mexican documentary of all time, according to the film's distributor. Judge Blanca Lopez Dominguez ordered that the film be blocked because a witness in the film, cousin to the murder victim, said he had not granted filmmakers permission to use his image. A key turning point in the film comes when the witness changes his initial statement, a development which helped the wrongfully accused protagonist, Antonio Zuniga, win his eventual release from prison. The film, made by British filmmaker Geoffrey Smith and Mexican lawyer Roberto Hernandez, is highly critical of court proceedings in Mexico, which frequently involve closed-door trials. The trailer for ""Presumed Guilty"" can be seen below. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Urban Battle in Medellin as Outsider Drug Cartel Moves in. An outsider criminal group from the Caribbean coast, far more ruthless, wealthy, and disciplined than Medellin's street gangs, is poised to take over Colombia's second largest city. InSight Crime visits the city's new battleground: the eastern neighborhood of Comuna 8. Like many of Medellin's peripheral neighborhoods, Comuna 8 sees frequent gun battles between the approximately 24 street gangs, or ""combos,"" that control extortion and drug trafficking in the area. This helped drive the murder rate up to 92 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2011, the third highest of Medellin's 16 comunas. The neighborhood, population 135,000, has long been among Medellin's most violent. But during the first week of May, Comuna 8 began seeing gun battles every day, at any time. ""It wasn't a couple of pistol shots after dark anymore,"" said one resident, who has lived over 20 years in the area. ""I heard things I'd never heard before. Machine gun fire, grenades."" The unspoken agreement between the combos that usually limited their turf wars to evening hours had apparently ended. Street life in Comuna 8 disappeared: the food carts that usually took up space on the street corners all cleared out. The only avocado seller who remained, who one woman said she'd bought from her entire life, was hit in the gut by a stray bullet. School was canceled. Bus lines shut down. Residents who had bedrooms that faced the street moved to the back of their apartments. Others said they began sleeping under their beds, with the mattress placed against the bed frame to absorb any stray gunfire. On June 20, the military moved in and began patrolling the streets, bringing a temporary calm to the neighborhood. But understanding why Comuna 8 saw such an acute flare up of violence, which many longtime residents said was unlike anything the embattled barrio had ever experienced, means understanding what the neighborhood represents in terms of Colombia's larger drug war. Enter the Urabenos One of Colombia's most powerful cartels, the Urabenos , whose stronghold lies along the Caribbean coast, has been trying to establish a foothold in Medellin since at least 2011. The problem is that the city has long been under control of the mafia network set up by Pablo Escobar in the 1980s, known as the Oficina de Envigado. For an outsider group like the Urabenos, wresting control from the Oficina (a cartel unloved by Medellin residents, but with the advantage of familiarity) was not going to be easy. The Urabenos' strategy involved launching their battle for Medellin at precisely the right time. They began deploying military cells to Medellin's outskirts just as the Oficina de Envigado resolved a drawn-out internal war between two rival factions. One of these factions was led by Maximiliano Bonilla, alias "" Valenciano ,"" who sold off part of his business to the Urabenos before he was arrested in Venezuela in November 2011. The victor, Erick Vargas, alias "" Sebastian ,"" was poised to become Medellin's undisputed crime lord, until the Urabenos entered the scene. ""The Urabenos confronted Sebastian and the Oficina when they were down. They were tired. They were battered from this other bloody war they'd just fought,"" says Fernando Quijano, director of Corpades, a local NGO that tracks security issues. The Urabenos have some key advantages over the Oficina. They have military training and superior weapons. They have a ruthless former paramilitary overseeing their Medellin campaign. Most of all, they have cash from their control of international cocaine export routes along the Caribbean coast. And while Sebastian's Oficina de Envigado has plenty of sources of funding -- including extortion of the city's businesses and the local drug trade -- their economic power cannot compare to that of the Urabenos. A typical foot soldier for the Oficina can expect to earn between 50,000 pesos (about $25) to 80,000 pesos (about $40) a week. The Urabenos are reportedly offering a starting rate of 400,000 pesos (about $200). The aim of the Urabenos is to establish control over all the major exit and entry points of Medellin. This means the ability to impose a war tax on all smugglers moving guns, drugs, or other contraband in and out of the city. The Urabenos have essentially already established control in the western and southern outskirts of Medellin (although some sections of these areas remain loyal to Sebastian). What remains is the north, and the east -- Comuna 8. Controlling this neighborhood means easy access to the eastern department of Antioquia, of which Medellin is the capital, and all the drug laboratories and coca crops in this region. It also brings them one step closer to dominance over Medellin, the crown jewel of Colombia's underworld. The War in Comuna 8 When urban warfare broke out in Comuna 8, it was partly a reflection of the same dynamics governing criminal behavior across the region from Honduras to Mexico. Medellin is basically seeing a battle between small criminal organizations for territorial control, in which these street gangs are backed by the larger cartels who control international drug export routes. And one of the main causes of violence between these smaller groups is betrayal: the switching of alliances from one national drug cartel to another. In Comuna 8, the break reportedly happened in Villatina, one of Comuna 8's 34 subdivisions. Last December, the Urabenos offered a large sum of money to the leader of the local gang in Villatina, alias ""Gomelo,"" if he submitted to their control. Gomelo spent about four months deliberating over what to do, then agreed to the offer. To seal the pact, on May 6 he killed a top confidant of Sebastian's, alias ""El Mellizo,"" who was charged with collecting the Oficina's extortion tax from Comuna 8. Police offer a different version of events, saying that Sebastian ordered Gomelo to hand over control to El Mellizo, and he refused. The Oficina's reaction was to mobilize the combos still loyal to Sebastian to Villatina and confront Gomelo, who appears to be in hiding, and the Urabenos. InSight Crime heard reports that there are about 300 armed members of the Urabenos in Comuna 8, although this number could include members of the combos that are allied to the drug cartel. The combos still loyal to the Oficina de Envigado have reportedly moved 250 fighters to Comuna 8. While the gun battles do not appear to have caused many deaths -- between January and May, Comuna 8 reportedly only registered 29 homicides, a 44 percent drop from the same period last year -- resident say they were unsettled by the usage of military-grade weapons, such as M60 machine guns, and explosives, as well as the frequency of attacks. The public outcry, rather than the number of killings, may have been what prompted the mayor's office to militarize the neighborhood. The Urabenos had a special interest in extending their reach to Villatina. With a foothold established here, they are only 10 minutes from the center of the city. There is also a police station in the neighborhood, and co-opting the officers based here would further cement their power in eastern Medellin. But if there is any neighborhood where Sebastian is likely to fight to the death, it is Comuna 8. The Oficina de Envigado leader grew up here. Other prominent members of the paramilitary bloc that used to dominate Medellin, the Cacique Nutibara, also have deep roots in this neighborhood. And throughout its history Medellin has rarely allowed outsider groups to cement their power in the city for long. Both the Urabenos and the Oficina are using street gangs to fight their war for them. But it is unlikely that many of these combos are keeping the bigger picture in mind. On the ground, the war is about fighting for an extra couple of blocks, and extracting revenge on a rival street gang that killed a family member one or two generations ago. One combo that has already accepted the Urabenos' pay-off is based in the Comuna 8 neighborhood La Sierra, subject of an award-winning documentary. A community leader who did not want to be named told InSight Crime that if the Urabenos take Villatina, the La Sierra gang will basically control the entire side of hill at the edge of Comuna 8, from top to nearly the bottom. ""Achieving that was beyond anything their fathers ever did,"" the community resident said. ""And now that they're there, they're not going to budge."" What Comes Next The leader of the Oficina de Envigado, Sebastian, is not thought to be in the city at the moment. For now, the Oficina's main advantage is numbers. Despite the Urabenos' recent advance in Comuna 8, this is still a bastion of the Oficina: at least 23 out of the 34 barrios here are still thought to be loyal to Sebastian. But ""loyalty"" is a tenuous term. While the helicopters monitoring the skies and the military units currently patrolling the streets of Comuna 8 have contributed to the conflict's quieting down, the peace is also allowing both sides to regroup and think through their next options. One possibility is that many combos will choose not to confront the Urabenos and their superior military force, but will simply wait until they are made an offer. This offer could consist of a one-time pay-off, perhaps with a pact that the combos receive weapons, training, and permission to continue running their own criminal activities in their neighborhood, so long as they hand over a percentage of their earnings to the Urabenos. What is clear is that violence is likely to increase in Medellin, and Comuna 8 will be one of the main war fronts. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Brazils UPP Struggles as Criminal Titans Continue Fight. A new report on crime statistics in Brazil's state of Rio de Janeiro shows deteriorating violence indicators over a period of several years, raising continued questions about the extent to which the city's public security policies have been effective. The Institute of Public Security (ISP), an independent entity affiliated with Rio de Janeiro's state security agency, issued a report on April 28 detailing crime statistics in Rio for the month of March using data from local police stations. According to the study, Rio de Janeiro has seen significant increases in the proportion of intentional homicides, vehicle thefts, and homicides resulting from police intervention in 2017, compared to the same period last year. Respectively, there was an 11.6 percent, 47.5 percent, and 96.7 percent increase in these indicators in March 2017, compared to March 2016. The trend remains largely the same when comparing data from the first three months of 2017 and 2016, with a 17.5 percent, 37.6 percent, and 85.2 percent rise this year in intentional homicides, vehicle thefts, and homicides resulting from police intervention, respectively. The study also suggests that the increasing frequency of these types of crime over the past year is representative of a larger pattern in worsening crime rates, particularly with respect to vehicle thefts and homicides resulting from police intervention. Registered cases of these two crimes in Rio have generally risen consistently since at least January 2014, more than doubling in the case of homicides resulting from police intervention. Relatedly, Brazilian authorities have accused leaders of one of the country's main criminal groups, the Red Command (Comando Vermelho), of ordering a recent attack in Rio from behind bars. On May 3, alleged members of the criminal group raided several parts of the city, burning nine buses and looting two trucks. ""We can confirm that the order was sent by Red Command leaders, detained in prisons outside of Rio,"" Carlos Augusto Leba, head of Rio's Civil Police, told a press conference. According to El Pais Brasil , the attacks were the Red Command's response to a large police operation designed to prevent the group from entering Cidade Alta, a neighborhood controlled by a rival group known as the Pure Third Command (Terceiro Comando Puro). The operation led to the seizure of 32 rifles, 45 arrests -- almost all suspected members of the Red Command -- and left two dead. Authorities hailed it as a success. ""In 34 years of working for the police, I had never seen such an effective operation and an arms seizure this big,"" said Rio's Security Secretary Roberto Sa. But the situation in Rio remains critical. On May 3, Justice Minister Osmar Serraglio announced that additional federal security forces will be sent to the city to help curb violence, reported The Rio Times. The ISP study provides further evidence of a continuing deterioration of previous security gains in Rio attributed to the city's ""pacification"" strategy, which involves sending special security forces, known as Police Pacification Units (Unidade de Policia Pacificadora - UPP), to establish a presence in particularly crime-ridden areas of the city. While the initial results of the pacification efforts seemed promising, the UPP initiative has been marred in controversy since its start in 2008. And criticism of the strategy has grown louder in recent years. As UPPs expanded into larger, more violent informal neighborhoods known as ""favelas,"" they were faced with intense pushback from criminal groups , which has only been exacerbated by sharp budget cuts and an insufficient focus on social development programs. The increasingly apparent inability of UPPs to serve as a long-term violence reduction solution is further highlighted by the dramatic rise in homicides resulting from police intervention indicated in the ISP study. As InSight Crime previously reported , ISP statistics also show that since March 2016 the number of killings by police have exceeded the figure registered for the same period the previous year, a problem that UPPs and other heavy-handed tactics tend to exacerbate. According to a recent Amnesty International report, authorities in Brazil are increasingly ignoring the problem and turning a blind eye to excessive force by Rio police. The government's announcement that it would escalate its security presence in Rio de Janeiro by sending additional federal security forces to the area following the recent clashes between police and gangs suggests that authorities will continue to rely on heavy-handed public security policies to deal with crime. Rio Security Secretary Sa recently indicated that he is open to revising the city's security policies, but so far there have been no clear indications of a coming overhaul. It is possible that rising crime rates could spur Rio officials to re-examine the UPP policy, particularly in light of evidence that Rio-based crime groups are becoming bolder and more violent. (The day after the May 3 attack that destroyed several vehicles, suspected members of a drug trafficking group assaulted a UPP outpost in the Complexo de Alemao favela.) However, any efforts to implement major changes in the city's security strategy are likely to be hampered by an ongoing budget crisis that has been blamed for contributing to the rising crime rates."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Monterrey Massacre Comes Amid Gulf-Zetas Battles. The slaughter of at least 20 people in a Monterrey bar is another violent manifestation of the ongoing battle for control of this north Mexico city, a vital link in the drug trade. As Milenio reports , two trucks full of assault rifle-toting gunmen arrived at the Sabino Gordo bar late Friday night, and opened fire in the crowded establishment. State authorities say that the primary targets in the attack were employees, many of whom hid beneath the tables as the shooting started. As many as 18 of those killed worked at Sabino Gordo. Because of the location of the attack, speculation about who was responsible centered on the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas , both of whom have a strong presence in Monterrey, the nation's third-largest city. However, in a series of public banners, or ""narcomantas,"" left around the country over the weekend, the Zetas denied responsibility for the crime , attributing it to the Gulf Cartel. Sources inside the Mexico's federal government told InSight Crime that they suspect agents of the Gulf Cartel fired on the bar because they thought Zetas congregated there. According to Jorge Domene Zambrano, the security spokesman for the state government in Nuevo Leon, where Monterrey is located, the bar was a center for retail drug distribution. They suspect that retail drug sales were a motivating factor in the attack, and the reason that employees specifically were targeted. They also referred to a man known as Alonso, alias ""El Botellero,"" as the target , though he was not among the dead. Personal-sized bags of cocaine were found among the wreckage after the shooting. While the nation's biggest drug traffickers have traditionally kept retail selling at arm's length, the growing size of the Mexican market and the fierce competition for territorial control have made it more common for larger groups to get involved. As one of the nation's largest and wealthiest cities, Monterrey has one of the most significant retail drug markets in Mexico. Long considered to be among the nation's safest and best run big cities, the area has been caught in the fallout of the split between the two most powerful criminal groups in Mexico's northeast: the Zetas and Gulf Cartel. The two groups used to operate as part of the same network, with the Zetas serving as hit men for their Gulf patrons. However, relations became strained following the 2003 arrest and 2007 extradition of Osiel Cardenas, the Gulf boss who founded the Zetas in the late 1990s, and the two groups began warring openly in early 2010. As a consequence of the groups' fighting over control of different cities and trafficking routes, violence has spiked in states where both had a presence, such as Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon. Nuevo Leon's murder rate is not nearly as high as some other Mexican regions -- it was less than 20 per 100,000 residents in 2010 , and though it is on pace to more than double that figure in 2011, the region is still far less violent than many other Mexican border towns. However, it has risen significant from the range of three to seven murders per 100,000 that had been standard since the 1990s. Furthermore, the tarnishing of Monterrey, once known as a jewel of northern Mexico, has many worrying about the nation's ability to handle drug violence. As a recent editorial in the Mexico City daily El Universal said of Monterrey's troubles: The second most important city in the country, the central nervous system of our national industry, is at breaking point, on the border between civility and barbarism. If Monterrey falls, as Ciudad Juarez and Reynosa have, the country will be one step away from doing so as well. While the editorial may overstate the degree of danger in which Monterrey finds itself, the city's recent decline serves as a stain on Mexico's reputation and serious challenge for its authorities. (See El Universal's video report on the Zeta-Gulf struggle for Monterrey, below). "	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"No FARC In Ecuador: Foreign Minister. Ecuador's Foreign Minister claimed there are no members of Colombia's guerrilla group FARC operating in its territory, an assertion that stands in stark contrast to a raft of evidence and statements made by the government's own armed forces. During an interview with InSight Crime, Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) do not have any military or criminal presence in his country. ""There are no people from the FARC working in Ecuador,"" he said. ""Maybe somebody could have infiltrated. [Raul] Reyes was at one time in Ecuadorean territory,"" he added, referencing Luis Edgar Devia, alias ""Raul Reyes,"" a FARC commander killed in Ecuadorean territory by Colombia's Air Force in 2008. ""It could be that a Colombian who is a member [of the FARC] is here for tourismBut members of the FARC here? Armed? In camps? That doesn't exist."" Responding to the allegation that FARC members transport drugs through the country towards the Pacific coast, the minister said: ""As soon as we find it, we crush it."" ""We do not conceal the presence of irregular armed groups in our territory,"" he added. ""On many occasions there have been people detained, and, in these cases, they have been handed over to Colombia or tried [here]."" Patino's comments contrast with the military's statements on this matter and InSight Crime's field research. The army regularly references the fight against FARC members operating in Ecuador, specifically on the border region. Security forces said at the end of last year that 19 FARC bases had been dismantled, 19 members had been captured and more than 173,000 coca plants destroyed during 2012. In January, an army general said the FARC had taken advantage of the peace process with the Colombian government to increase arms trafficking through Ecuador. In March, Ecuadorean army chief, General Jorge Pena, said the FARC had been significantly reduced in Ecuador but acknowledged their presence. InSight Crime's own field research in the area at the end of 2012 found Colombian rebels were still active and able to operate with relative ease. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"In Mexico, Cartel Fragments Battle for Control of Morelos. Splinters of once-powerful criminal cartels are causing havoc in the central state of Morelos, in an example of how much of Mexico's violence is now driven by newly formed, local gangs who appear to act without a long-term survival strategy. In the most recent wave of violence, at least five people were killed and another 15 wounded after attacks on several bars across the state on May 25 and 26. At several of the attack sites, authorities reported finding banners signed by one of Mexico's newer criminal groups, Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors), making threats against two rival gangs. This latest massacre is a reminder that Morelos has not been spared by Mexico's cartel wars, even though the territory has traditionally been treated by drug traffickers as a place to relax and do business in peace. The second smallest state in the country is a favored vacation spot for residents of the capital, thanks to its year-round warm climate. Nevertheless, the total number of homicides in the state almost doubled between 2009 and 2010, according to data kept by national statistics agency INEGI. The latter was the most violent year on record, with 487 homicides by INEGI's count. But it is not the amount of violence in Morelos that makes the state emblematic of Mexico's current conflict. After all, its homicide statistics hardly compare to those of the country's most violent states. More noteworthy are the identities of the criminal groups driving Morelos' crime wave: they are fragments of once-mighty drug cartels that broke into competing factions after their leaders were killed or arrested. Morelos is a microcosm of what is happening across Mexico: as the underworld splinters, smaller groups have emerged to fight bitterly over the spoils, driving up violence rates in unexpected places. Frequently, the origins of these younger gangs are murky. The Guerreros Unidos, which has been blamed for the most recent attacks in Morelos, is a good example. The group first appeared in December 2011, claiming responsibility for the killing of three men in state capital Cuernavaca. The group was initially rumoured to be a rebellious spin-off from the Familia Michoacana , a cartel that split into two major factions after its leader was killed in 2010. Officials have said Guerreros Unidos is an alliance of former members of the Zetas and the Familia, which would explain the name ""United Warriors."" Some of Guerrero Unidos' public statements echo the Familia's moralistic discourse, which would support the government's account. A banner hung in Taxco, Guerrero, in early May claimed that the Guerrero Unidos were different from rival gangs who ""dedicate themselves to kidnapping, extortion, charging taxes, and killing innocent people."" This type of rhetoric was frequently used by the Familia to distinguish themselves from their rivals the Zetas, whom they tried to depict as worse, more violent criminals. But the Guerreros Unidos have also stated that the Familia Michoacana is one of their main rivals, according to a banner left at one of their kill sites last weekend, local newspaper Diario de Morelos reported. In several banners, the Guerreros Unidos has stated that its aim is to rid Guerrero and Morelos of another rival group, the Rojos, and it is likely that last weekend's bar attacks were linked to this conflict. The Rojos are particularly representative of how Mexico's once-hegemonic gangs have gone through several generations of leadership in just a few short, extremely bloody years. The Rojos originally acted as enforcers and kidnappers for crime lord Arturo Beltran Leyva, until their leader, Jesus Nava Romero, alias ""El Rojo,"" was killed alongside Arturo in a shootout with the Mexican Navy in December 2009. Following Arturo's death, the Rojos regrouped and may have drawn new recruits from a gang of assassins once known as the Pelones de Guerrero, previously based in Guerrero state and Michoacan's Tierra Caliente region. While the heir to the Beltran Leyva Organization , Hector , tried to maintain control over the central Mexican region and renamed his organization the South Pacific Cartel (CPS), the Rojos and the Pelones sided with Hector's rival, Edgar Valdez Villareal, alias ""La Barbie,"" former leader of the Pelones. After Villareal was jailed, the fusion between the Rojos and the Pelones settled in Cuernavaca and continued fighting their main challenger, the Familia Michoacana, for control of the Morelos plaza. As Proceso points out , much of the current conflict between the Rojos, the Familia, and the Guerreros Unidos is over control of a drug trafficking corridor between Cuernavaca and Chilpancingo, Guerrero. This is a strategic route connecting Cuernavaca to Acapulco and the Pacific coast (see map, below). It is telling that the Morelos plaza is being fought over at all. The region has a long history of housing drug traffickers, but the tradition is one of a peaceful occupation, with emphasis on bribing public officials and adhering to territorial agreements, rather than fighting viciously for outright control. In the early 1990s, Juarez Cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes was able to operate comfortably in the state thanks to his links to the former governor and the judicial police. Later on, the Sinaloa Cartel purchased much of the same protection. Even elusive Sinaloa leader Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno, alias "" El Azul ,"" lived more or less openly in Cuernavaca for a time, as Proceso details. New generation groups like the Guerreros Unidos and the Rojos have broken with this tradition, engaging in open war in Morelos. This has drawn plenty of attention from the security forces and the federal government, which announced a $23 million security surge on May 9 , intended to pacifiy the state. The former rulers of Morelos -- the old-school traffickers like Esparragoza and the Beltran Leyvas -- thought the strategically useful space was best treated as neutral territory, with criminal activity assuming a low profile to avoid attention. But given the current state of Mexico's fragmenting underworld, splinter groups like the Guerreros Unidos have little choice but to fight fiercely for whatever slice of territory they can hold on to, even though doing so may threaten their chance of long-term survival.

"Morales: DEA Will Not Return to Bolivia. Bolivian President Evo Morales stated unequivocally that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) will not return to Bolivia, despite a new agreement between the two countries to cooperate in the fight against drug trafficking. ""The DEA will not return because of issues of sovereignty,"" Morales said Tuesday during a meeting of leaders of the Andean states in Bogota. He called Monday's agreement one of ""mutual respect,"" and said, ""For the first time, since the founding of Bolivia, the U.S. will respect Bolivian rule, including Bolivian laws and the constitution."" Bolivian law permits the cultivation of coca for traditional uses, while the U.S. deems all coca cultivation illegal. Morales himself was a coca grower and a leader of the coca-farmers' fight against DEA eradication programs. ""I was personally a victim of the DEA ,"" Morales said. ""Armed, uniformed Americans commanded the police, commanded the armed forces. They repressed us. That is over."" Morales expelled the DEA, and U.S. Ambassador Philip Goldberg, in September 2008 after accusing them of conspiring to overthrow his administration. During a press conference Tuesday in La Paz, Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera said he stood by the the decision to expel Goldberg and the DEA because it ""saved our country from a coup d'etat."" ""In no article of the agreement does it say the DEA will return,"" Garcia Linera said. ""We do not need it. We do not need a foreign police agency of political character in our country."" Garcia Linera, while admitting some difficulties, said the Bolivian police, intelligence agencies and armed forces were improving their fight against drug traffickers without the help of the DEA.

Guatemala to Sign Agreement with US to Trace Illegal Weapons. Guatemala is set to gain access to the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' (ATF) weapons tracing system, to track arms confiscated from criminal groups in the country. Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz declared that the new agreement would give Guatemala access to the ATF's database, which is also used by Mexico to track the origin of seized weapons, reported Prensa Libre. Paz y Paz also noted that granting access to Guatemala, a key transit country for illegal weapons, is a vital step in helping monitor arms trafficking throughout the region. According to a recent report by Plaza Publica , there are over 1 million weapons circulating in Guatemala, some 800,000 of which are unregistered. In 2007, the country had the highest number of guns per head of population in Central America. Many of these weapons are left over from the country's civil conflict, with guns from both rebel and government stockpiles circulating on the black market. This black market for firearms is mostly controlled by criminal networks that evolved from civil war-era security forces , known as the Illegal Clandestine Security Apparatuses ( CIACS ). Many weapons in Guatemala also come from the transnational illicit arms trade. Guatemala's attorney general found last year that the vast majority of illegal weapons seized in the country had been sourced from Honduras , which has some of the more lax gun laws in the region. Guatemala's illicit weapons are not always destined for domestic criminals, with many transported north on to Mexico. While US Justice Department data suggests that up to 70 percent of weapons recovered in Mexico over the past five years can be traced back to the United States , other sources have suggested that Guatemala's CIACS play a major role in providing firearms to Mexican criminal organizations such as the Zetas. Access to the ATF's weapons tracing system will help the authorities determine where their efforts should be focused in combating the illicit arms trade in the country.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Guatemalas New President Dogged by His Past and Security Challenges. Alejandro Giammattei assumes Guatemala's presidency facing various security challenges, including drug trafficking, impunity, institutional weakness and poor law enforcement. And two notorious cases from his tenure as Guatemala's prison director in the mid-2000s still loom large. As prisons director for former President Oscar Berger, Giammattei was overseeing the country's jails in September 2006, when seven inmates at the Pavon prison were massacred. Giammattei spent ten months in jail in 2010 during the investigation into the Pavon killings, in which he was alleged to have been complicit but was never charged, and a judge dismissed the case for lack of evidence. The case, however, continues to have repercussions. On November 29, 2019, a Swiss court upheld the conviction and 15-year sentence of Erwin Sperisen , the police director in office when the Pavon massacre occurred. In 2014, Sperisen, who has dual citizenship in Guatemala and Switzerland, was first convicted of complicity in the extrajudicial killings. Sperisen, who maintains his innocence in the murders, continues to challenge his conviction. His legal proceedings have taken place in Switzerland, where he has lived since 2007, because that country does not extradite its citizens. Also accused of complicity in the Pavon massacre was Carlos Vielman, the security minister at the time of the incident, who was later acquitted by a Spanish court. Prior to having his sentence upheld in Switzerland, Sperisen spoke to the Guatemalan congress, claiming that he was not responsible for the Pavon massacre. In his testimony, Sperisen pointed to statements by the mother of one of the inmates killed in the Pavon , who said that she did not blame the ex-police chief for what had transpired, but rather Giammattei. ""My son told me [before he died] that Giammattei had been behind everything. I focused all my anger towards Giammattei at that time he was the director of the Pavon,"" Maria Vasquez, the mother of the inmate, said in her testimony. Guatemala's new president has denied the Pavon allegations on several occasions, most recently doing so in June of last year during an interview with the EFE Agency, in which he claimed that the accusations are politically motivated. Giammattei was also prisons director in February 2007, when four police officials jailed on accusations of killing three Salvadoran congressmen were shot dead at El Boqueron prison. The police officers were found dead after they made clear they planned to divulge information about who was behind the murder of the Salvadoran officials. That murder-coverup of the Salvadoran congressmen, known as Parlacen case , made headlines recently when an inmate shot jailed former Guatemalan congressman Manuel Castillo in the head. Castillo was serving time in El Pavon after he was sentenced to 203 years in prison in 2008 for his role in the murder of the Salvadoran officials. According to the first reports by the Guatemalan penitentiary system , Castillo was killed in front the offices of the jail director. Giammattei's connections to Guatemala's dark past are concerning, given that the country is backtracking on earlier efforts to prosecute high-level corruption and impunity. Giammattei comes to power after Guatemala's International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala ( Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG) -- a United Nations-backed judicial body made up of foreign prosecutors -- was shut down by his predecessor, Jimmy Morales. CICIG collaborated with the Attorney General's Office to investigate several members of the country's elite, including both Morales and Giammattei. Giammattei's bid for the presidency was backed by a battered elite that had seen its political influence decline, largely in response to criminal investigations. He will govern without the support of a large political party and will depend, to a large extent, on the support of those same elite groups: businessmen, longtime conservative politicians, and the military leaders that have long influenced the security cabinet. He takes the reins of a country seemingly at a security crossroads. Homicide rates have been steadily declining for years, but organized crime has gained ground, particularly drug trafficking. According to US officials consulted by InSight Crime, about 98 percent of the cocaine that crosses the Central American corridor moves through Guatemala. Giammattei now faces a resurgence of drug trafficking groups -- something Guatemala has not experienced since the large local clans, such as the Mendoza, Lorenzana, and Chamale clans, were dismantled. The MS13 and Barrio 18 street gangs, both of which generate violence and public insecurity in the Northern Triangle, have never had the territorial nor the political strength in Guatemala that they have maintained in Honduras and El Salvador. But as they have put down roots in Guatemala, their presence will be yet another challenge for the new president."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
Meth Trafficker Sentence Highlights Asia Ties to Mexicos Sinaloa Cartel. A Chinese-Mexican methamphetamine trafficker who operated in Mexico has been sentenced to 25 years in prison while the alleged leader of the operation -- his cousin -- awaits extradition back to Mexico from the United States, in a case highlighting the Sinaloa Cartel's Asian connections. A court in Mexico State capital Toluca found Ye Yong Qing guilty of organized crime, synthetic drug production and activities involving the use of illicit funds, reported Milenio. Yong Qing worked as part of a methamphetamine trafficking organization run by his cousin, Zhenli Ye Gon. Yong Qing was Ye Gon's business partner in a company established in Toluca with money from criminal activities, reported Proceso. Another suspected member of the organization, Fu Huaxin, was absolved of similar charges. Ye Gon is seen as a pioneer of sorts who -- by trading with Asia through third countries -- opened the way for massive production of methamphetamines in the Western Hemisphere and gave the Sinaloa Cartel a major foothold in the Far East. He owned several pharmaceutical companies in Mexico and reportedly worked as the Sinaloa Cartel's biggest precursor chemical provider , using his Chinese connections to facilitate numerous shipments into Argentina that were later sent to Mexico. He was also a client of HSBC's Mexico branch, HBMX , believed to have moved some $90 million through HSBC and another three Mexico-based banks. In 2007, after authorities in Mexico discovered over $205 million in cash along with weapons in his house, Ye Gon fled the country. He was later captured and tried in the US for conspiring to manufacture methamphetamines. However, in an ironic twist, these US charges were dismissed with prejudice -- meaning he cannot be re-tried in the US -- in 2009 due to a lack of evidence. After a failed attempt to file for habeas corpus to get released from prison, Ye Gon now awaits extradition to Mexico where he faces drug, money laundering and illegal arms possession charges. Still, the Sinaloa Cartel's contacts with Asia remain strong and may be growing. There are reports of Sinaloa Cartel operatives running a methamphetamine lab in Malaysia, purchasing heroin in Afghanistan and the cartel sending hit men to kill off arrested associates in the Philippines. In January, Sin Embargo reported the Mexican organization relied on two groups from China for the primary materials used to make methamphetamines.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"The Bus Route That Institutionalized Extortion in El Salvador. In El Salvador, extortion demanded by gangs has become so normalized that there is a bus company that deducts the cost of extortion directly from drivers' payroll in order to make an annual payment to the Barrio 18. The drivers understand it: refusing to pay is equivalent to death and reporting the extortion, in a lawless state that has lost all territorial control, would do very little. *** In early 2014, a young boy, aged around 12 years old arrived at the terminal. I was having lunch with two friends in a small house nearby where we had parked the buses. The child arrived looking unkempt, in baggy clothes and clutching a piece of paper in his hand. ""Here, they sent you this letter,"" the boy said, leaving the paper before setting off. * This article was translated, edited for clarity and length and published with the permission of Factum.

The letter's message was eminently clear, ""From today, all bus drivers must give us a special contribution of their salary if they do not want attacks against their lives. Signed: Barrio 18."" One of us there took the paper to the bus route manager. The amount of money requested was exceptionally high for each driver to have to pay. I don't remember well if it was maybe $200 or $300. Immediately our boss called a meeting and the following day we spoke about it. *** This story was told by a bus driver from a company in San Salvador's metropolitan area. The route, like nearly all others in Salvador, has been blackmailed for years by two most notorious criminal organizations in El Salvador, the Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18. However, this bus route has a particularly unscrupulous story: it decided to institutionalize the extortion, brazenly including it on the payrolls of its employees. Telling this story, the driver explained, is risky. Speaking in detail about what happens on his route could mean (if he has good luck) immediate dismissal, or (with less luck) death. For this reason, he has asked that his name and the name of his bus route not be divulged. *** There was not much to discuss. The drivers on the route know that we must give the gangs what they ask for. The other option is to refuse which is basically signing our own death sentence. The boss explained the situation to all of us and said that he was going to call a negotiator from Barrio 18 in the area to whom the extortion is to be paid, to try to get the cost lowered. We then realized that this information had been leaked. They knew that our route had benefits and that we are paid bonuses, so they decided to impose a fee on us too. The deduction from our salary to be paid to the gang is written directly on our payslips. From then on we were told that we would be charged twice a year to pay a fee to the gang. In total, it's $100 per driver per year. The deduction from our salary to be paid to the gang is written directly on our payslips. There it clearly states ""Extortion Mara 18."" Luckily we have a saving scheme in place for this. We are discounted $3 or $4 a day, which we save and are given back at the end of the year. Those savings are how we make the two payments for the extortion. Our route has 46 drivers and 13 other staff members. We all get charged the two fees per year. If you do the math, how much is $100 for 43 drivers plus the other 13? Thousands! And that's only on this route. Can you imagine how much they make across all the routes in the country? *** The driver doesn't know this, but some bus companies have daringly calculated an ""official figure"" of extortion in the country, a payment of around $26 million a year -- as said earlier this year by Rene Velasco, one of the businessmen who represents the transport sector before the National Council on Citizen Security and Coexistance. According to Velasco, this figure was obtained by multiplying the average amount of extortion demanded by the 10,500 vehicles that make up the national transport fleet. ""Usually, people get on the bus and threaten the driver. They ask for between $10 and $50 each week,"" Velasco estimated according to La Prensa Grafica. *** You always feel terrible. Imagine what I could do with the other $100? I have children, a wife, a family to feed. It takes so much to earn that money, which they just take away from us. It doesn't stop making us angry seeing a kid arriving to take our money. A kid that could well be any of us! But, what can you do? Nothing. They'll kill you. The route I work for is being extorted enormously. I have been working there for more than five years and when I started I wasn't young. It was the same with the other routes where I worked before. However, the difference is that on the other routes the gang members would go up to drivers and charge them a daily amount. It was only $1 or $2, depending on the gang and the area. For example, on the previous route I worked, they sent a small package for money with one of the drivers that was departing. ""There you are going to go to the gas station and you are going to order this. Hand it over there."" In the gas station, a strange kid came over and asked if they had sent the package. Someone gave him the bag of money and he got off the bus. Composed. Here it is different. Here the gang sends different people to the terminal who ask directly for the boss. Stating their full name, they say, ""I've come to bring the 'thing,'"" and the bus route gives them the monthly payment. The messengers are bold and impertinent, not even afraid or hiding their identities. This doesn't happen on just this route. It happens on a multitude. But nobody likes to talk about it. It's too dangerous. If you go to another route and tell the driver, you have to pretend that you are interested in getting work there and ask how much each driver is charged for extortion. If the young man is sincere, he'll tell you, you don't need to outsmart him to find out. I don't know if all the bus companies will put the extortion fee on their employees' payroll, but I assume if they are proper companies they would have to say it on the payslips as they do here. I don't understand it entirely, but the gang that receives the most money from us is Mara Salvatrucha because we go through quite a few areas controlled by them. But, as we also go through areas controlled by Barrio 18, we also have to pay them. I mean, we're really fucked up. The good thing is that at least they don't kill us. It's always hard to have your money taken when it has cost you so much. But, I can say to my wife in the morning ""I'll be back in the evening."" I tell her that if we don't pay them every day, ""I don't know if I'm going to return home later."" *** One piece of information that confirms what the driver said, which he probably doesn't even know about, is that about 800 transport employees (drivers, conductors and other workers) were killed between 2005 and 2014, according to the newspaper El Diario de Hoy. *** Report it to the police? No! That would be most foolish thing we could ever do! Have you seen the movie called, ""Sleeping with the Enemy?"" Well, that's how it is with us. We live surrounded by gang members. They are everywhere. They go up to the vehicles, they are near the bus stops, and they have people by the areas where we pass through. If they wanted to kill us, it wouldn't cost them anything. They can easily find out if you file a complaint. Just being here and talking with you about this topic is very risky. It's risky because today you don't know whom you're talking to, nor who's nearby listening to what you say. As the guys say, ""See, hear and shut up if you want to enjoy life."" I don't know if all the bus companies will put the extortion fee on their employees' payroll, but I assume if they are proper companies they would have to say it on the payslips as they do here. That's why I tell you, if you want, go to the terminal and ask for the manager. He can give you more information. Although if you go to the terminal, I recommend you go by car. Do not go by bus because there are kids who work for the gangs that are well-informed and notice who arrives. What I can tell you is that it's on the payroll, as I've already told you, it's the reality. And no, I do not think this will change soon. I have had years and years of this being the same, yet every time it gets worse. Here, it is already becoming normalized. *** Factum visited the offices of the route where the driver works. A security worker greeted them kindly and passed on their message to the manager's secretary. After a few minutes of waiting, without asking what Factum had come for, the manager told them that he was leaving and that they should look for him later. Two days later, Factum phoned the offices on the route and asked if an interview could be arranged. The secretary answered and said yes, but her boss wanted to know the subject first. The answer was about gang's collecting extortion, the secretary said she would consult with the manager. Monday November 7, Factum called again to the offices of the route. The secretary said that the manager was out of the office all week. Three days later, on Thursday 11, Factum called again and asked to at least give us a brief interview on the phone. The manager answered. ""Hello."" ""I'm calling from Factum magazine. We have been trying to have an interview with you, but it hasn't been possible."" ""What do you want to talk about."" ""The subject is extortion. We want to know how you handle this problem."" ""No, no. I cannot say anything about that."" ""We have information that you deduct extortion from your employees on the payroll."" ""And who gave you that information?"" ""A source, I cannot tell you the name, but we'd like to talk to you in person"" ""No no no. Look, talk to the person who has told you that. Ask him everything."" The manager hung up. After several unanswered calls, the secretary answered again to say that her boss could no longer speak. * This article was translated, edited for clarity and length and published with the permission of Factum.

"Global Financial Integrity - Transnational Crime in the Developing World. Global Financial Integrity , a branch of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for International Policy , released a new report today entitled "" Transnational Crime in the Developing World ."" Its authors detail the devastating environmental, political and economic effects of transnational crime, shedding light on the manner in which criminal activities flourish in the weak states of the developing world. According to the report, transnational crime brings in $650 billion annually, and can be divided into twelve main markets. These twelve major illicit markets, and their annual profits, are ranked as follows: 1. Drugs - $320 billion 2. Counterfeiting - $250 billion 3. Humans - $31.6 billion 4. Oil - $10.8 billion 5. Wildlife - $7.8 to $10 billion 6. Timber - $7 billion 7. Fish - $4.2 to $9.5 billion 8. Art and Cultural Propert y - $3.4 to $6.3 billion 9. Gold - $2.3 billion 10. Human Organs - $0.614 to $1.2 billion 11. Small Arms & Light Weapons - $0.3 to $1 billion 12. Diamonds & Colored Gemstones - $0.86 billion From the report's executive summary: ""This report analyzes the scale, flow, profit distribution, and impact of 12 different types of illicit trade: drugs, humans, wildlife, counterfeit goods and currency, human organs, small arms, diamonds and colored gemstones, oil, timber, fish, art and cultural property, and gold. Though the specific characteristics of each market vary, in general it can be said that these profitable and complex criminal operations originate primarily in developing countries, thrive in the space created by poverty, inequality, and state weakness, and contribute to forestalling economic prosperity for billions of people in countries across the world.""The final and most critical point is that criminal networks, which function most easily where there is a certain level of underdevelopment and state weakness, have very little incentive to bolster the legitimate economies in the countries where they operate. Unregulated, they minimize overhead in developing source countries by exploiting local labor forces, often resorting to forced or child labor, dodging environmental and safety regulations, and evading trade tariffs. Any improvements in economic development and governance would usually hinder their illegal activities, so it is in their best interest to actively prevent their profits from flowing into legitimate developing economies. In this way, transnational crime and underdevelopment have a mutually perpetuating relationship. "" Read the full report ( .pdf ) "	1	0	0	0	1	0	1
"ELN Cocaine Seizure Points to Expanding Presence on Colombias Pacific Coast. Authorities seized around 1.5 metric tons of cocaine linked to the ELN rebels in Colombia's Choco department, the latest sign that the group is expanding by absorbing territory and dissidents of the demobilizing FARC guerrillas. Colombia's military discovered the sizable cocaine shipment on March 19 along the Pacific coast of the Jurado municipality in Choco, near the border with Panama, EFE reported. The shipment, reportedly belonging to Colombia's second largest guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN), appears to have been headed to Central America. Meanwhile, a report published March 13 by the Colombian foundation Ideas para la Paz warned that the ELN is expanding in at least five departments by taking over illegal operations previously controlled by the demobilizing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), the country's largest guerrilla movement. Choco appears among these areas, along with the department of Narino, the Bajo Cauca region of Antioquia department, Norte de Santander's Catatumbo subregion, and the Cauca department. SEE ALSO : Coverage of the FARC Peace Process In addition, in Cauca's Toribio municipality, FARC dissidents have allegedly joined the ELN group, according to local testimonies reported by Colombia's El Pais. The reports appear to confirm previous warnings that the FARC peace process could impact ELN activities in certain parts of the country. Colombian authorities had already seized a record-breaking four metric tons of cocaine from the ELN in January 2017 in Narino, which supported the notion that the guerrilla group was assuming control of former FARC territories in that area. The latest seizure near the Panama border could indicate a replication of the this trend in Choco -- another key department, given its Pacific coastline and its border with Panama -- at a time when Colombia is believed to be producing more cocaine than ever before. In addition to the January seizure in Narino, the department's key transshipment port of Tumaco has recently suffered from an outbreak of violence as criminal groups including the ELN battled for control of the port. InSight Crime field investigations have uncovered evidence that the ELN has taken over much of the FARC's system of ""taxing"" drug production in Narino, the department with Colombia's highest levels of coca cultivation. SEE ALSO : Colombia News and Profiles Not only does the latest seizure add to evidence of the ELN's expansion in Choco, but El Pais' report of FARC dissidents joining the rebel group could mean a worrying transfer of more than just territory between the two guerrilla movements. The ELN may also be inheriting the FARC's extensive operational knowledge regarding an array of criminal activities, built over decades of managing the drug trade. As InSight Crime previously noted , these developments are likely to have considerable consequences for the ELN's incipient peace talks with Colombia's government. The considerable illegal profits that can be earned in the drug trade add to doubts about the ELN leadership's ability to ensure that rank-and-file members will abide by an eventual peace deal."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
"SouthCom Commander Backs Military Involvement in Fighting Crime. The top US military officer in Latin America and the Caribbean recently praised the involvement of the region's armed forces in fighting organized crime, a controversial stance likely rooted in the politics surrounding US security assistance to foreign countries. In an August 17 speech that opened the South American Defense Conference in Uruguay, Navy Adm. Kurt Tidd, the commander of US Southern Command (SouthCom), said that armed forces in Latin America and the Caribbean are adapting to a ""global security environment [that] is the most complex, volatile, and unpredictable in at least the last half-century."" ""We're no longer simply dealing with conventional conflicts that displace millions of people and destabilize entire regions,"" Tidd said, ""we're also facing complex, networked threats like transregional crime and violent extremism that transcend borders and boundaries."" Tidd's comments fit with the stated theme of the conference, which was ""the changing role of the military in the region."" The SouthCom commander told the audience that new threats like those posed by criminal organizations ""blur the lines between domestic security and defense,"" and that responding to them requires ""creative responses by re-conceptualized security forces."" Tidd expressed support for militaries becoming more involved in meeting emerging security challenges. He credited the region's militaries with ""breaking new ground"" and ""charting a bold new course"" in terms of their activities in the region, adding that they ""are demonstrating an impressive commitment to improving security both within and beyond our borders."" ""I challenge all of us to be creative and bold in our thinkingespecially when it comes to what comes next for our forces,"" Tidd said. There is substantial popular support in most of Latin American and the Caribbean for involving the military in crime fighting activities. But SouthCom has an institutional interest in promoting the use of the military to combat organized crime in the region. In addition to overseeing the large US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, SouthCom's other major activity in its area of responsibility is administering security assistance to partner countries. In fact, in testimony to the US Senate earlier this year ( pdf ), Tidd said that ""building partner capacity is the cornerstone of everything we do."" However, the United States faces virtually no military threat from any country in the region, and countries in the region face virtually no military threats either from each other or from any other nations. This means that SouthCom would have very little to do -- and therefore, a very small budget -- if it were not engaged in training Latin American and Caribbean armed forces to fight organized crime. This dynamic raises a number of concerns from a public safety and human rights perspective. Many experts in recent years have questioned the wisdom of involving militaries in operations targeting criminal organizations. A growing body of evidence suggests that deploying the military to fight crime groups tends not to be effective at dismantling criminal networks in the long term, and can actually increase violence in the short run. But despite such concerns, many countries in the region have incorporated the armed forces in crime fighting activities, often with support from SouthCom. For example, SouthCom public affairs director Greg Julian called Honduras a "" fantastic "" partner on counter-narcotics in 2013, in spite of persistent concerns about corruption and human rights abuses by military units tasked with anti-drug operations. And in April 2014, then-commander of SouthCom Gen. John Kelly described Mexico as "" an unbelievable partner "" in countering drug trafficking less than three months before Mexican soldiers allegedly massacred more than a dozen people at a crime scene. On the other hand, some US government actors have expressed reservations about using taxpayer dollars to provide assistance to governments whose militaries have been accused of human rights violations in the course of operations targeting criminal organizations. Last year, the State Department redirected millions of dollars in aid from Mexico to Peru over human rights concerns. And earlier this year, Congressman Hank Johnson introduced a bill that would block all US security assistance to Honduras until that country takes steps to address human rights concerns. Still, the Defense Department wields significant influence in the halls of Congress, which means US funding for militarized anti-crime assistance is likely to continue. And while this may benefit SouthCom and militaries across Latin America and the Caribbean, it is far less likely to help countries in the region to confront complex challenges associated with organized crime like drug abuse , money laundering and elite corruption ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Bolivia Withdraws from UN Drug Convention. The Bolivian government has confirmed its decision to renounce a major UN drug convention, after rejecting its classification of the coca leaf as an illicit substance. On Tuesday, the Bolivian Senate approved a new law which sets out Bolivia's rejection of the 1961 Convention on Narcotic Drugs, and on Thursday Bolivia's ambassador to the UN, Pablo Salon, conveyed his country's decision to UN Secretary Ban Ki-moon. The move follows the rejection of Bolivian president Evo Morales' proposal that the UN remove the obligation on countries which have signed the treaty to ban traditional uses of the coca leaf. The head of the Bolivian Senate, Rene Martinez, explained the government's position that ""the use of the coca leaf has nothing to do with drugs."" However Martinez confirmed that the renunciation of the convention implies neither a desire to have the treaty abolished nor to withdraw from the 1961 Vienna Convention, but only for a revision which would remove coca leaves from the list of drugs banned by the UN. The chewing of coca leaves is an ancient practice among the indigenous population of the Andean region. The plant can be used to counteract the effects of altitude as well as neutralizing hunger. It also has considerable religious and social value. The coca leaf, however, is also a used in the production of cocaine. As InSight Crime has previously noted, large quantities of the coca plant are grown in Bolivia for use in the drug trade. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"The Narco of Narcos: Fugitive Mexican Drug Lord Rafael Caro Quintero. The release of Rafael Caro Quintero from a Mexican prison in August 2013 was a blow to US-Mexico relations, the reputation of the Mexican justice system, and the drug war. Caro Quintero had been imprisoned since 1989 for drug trafficking, murder, and perhaps most importantly the abduction, torture and killing of Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena, an agent for the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). When Caro Quintero was freed in August 2013 -- a federal court overturned his sentence because he had been tried in a state court rather than a federal one -- the US State Department offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest, while the Mexican Attorney General's Office also issued a new warrant for his apprehension. This article originally appeared in the Combating Terrorism Center's publication, the CTC Sentinel. See the original here. Whether Rafael Caro Quintero still has clout in the Mexican cartel underworld is uncertain. Born in La Noria, Sinaloa, on October 3, 1952, he is widely considered to be one of the godfathers of the Mexican drug trade; upon his release from prison, one Mexican newspaper referred to him as the ""narco of narcos."" Yet he is 61-years-old, and the Mexican drug trafficking landscape has changed immensely since the days when he was in charge. Rather than one or two cartels controlling operations, the situation is far more fluid today, with numerous groups and upstart organizations controlling production and distribution. This article reviews Caro Quintero's rapid rise in Mexico's drug underworld, reveals his significant ties to the Sinaloa Federation, and attempts to dissect his activities since his release from prison in August 2013. It finds that Caro Quintero's importance today is likely mostly symbolic given his age and apparent lack of influence in drug trafficking operations in recent years. It is possible, however, that Caro Quintero still has clout when it comes to the money laundering side of cartel operations. A Rapid Rise In the 1980s, Caro Quintero was considered a pioneer. He allegedly oversaw operations for the Guadalajara Cartel at Rancho Bufalo, a vast marijuana plantation in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua with an annual production value of roughly $8 billion. In its prime, the Guadalaraja Cartel was the only drug trafficking organization in Mexico, with a corruption network that spanned the country. Headed by Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, the Guadalaraja Cartel was responsible for forging the ties to Colombian drug trafficking networks that exist to this day. By the age of 29, Caro Quintero had reportedly amassed a fortune of $500 million, 36 houses and some 300 companies in the Guadalajara area. An indictment issued in the Central District of California in June 1989 named Caro Quintero as a member of the now defunct Guadalajara Cartel. Caro Quintero's residence was identified as the location where DEA agent Camarena was tortured and killed. The US Treasury Department identified him as the ""mastermind"" behind Camarena's abduction and murder. He was also accused of distributing tens of thousands of tons of marijuana throughout Mexico and into the United States. Upon his arrest in 1985, shortly after the killing of Camarena, Caro Quintero was charged with murder and sentenced to 40-years in a Mexican prison. Significant Ties In recent years, in part due to his imprisonment but also as a result of the Guadalajara Cartel's apparent demise, Caro Quintero has remained off the radar. In June 2013, shortly before Caro Quintero's release from prison, the US Treasury Department released information on him and his primary associates, which linked Caro Quintero closely to Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno, alias ""El Azul"", an alleged high-ranking member of the Sinaloa Federation. The link is significant since it alleges that Caro Quintero still has criminal ties to one of the men widely believed to be a likely successor to the throne of the Sinaloa Federation. Throughout his life, Esparragoza Moreno has kept a low profile and moved horizontally and vertically between both the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels, effectively utilizing his role as an adviser to ""stay in the background,"" as one US official explained. Indeed, in many press releases issued by the Mexican government that list the country's most-wanted drug traffickers, Esparragoza Moreno is often left out. At one point in the late 1990s, he was thought to be both a high-ranking member of the Juarez Cartel and a high-ranking adviser in the Sinaloa cartel. The cartels' relationship at the time was considered to be fluid and disorganized, allowing Esparragoza Moreno to utilize his diplomatic and strategic skills to position himself in both organizations at the same time. It is a feat that has not been duplicated by any other major cartel figure. Of all the Sinaloa Federation's senior leaders, Esparragoza Moreno is the one who appears to have suffered the least pressure from the recent years of law enforcement operations. Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada's son, Vicente, is currently on trial in Chicago, and dozens of Sinaloa cartel lieutenants have been arrested or captured. Drug capo Ignacio ""Nacho"" Coronel Villareal was killed in a 2010 shootout with the Mexican military, while Arturo Beltran Leyva (also known as ""El Barbas"") was killed in a bloody raid on a Cuernavaca apartment complex in December 2009; his brother Alfredo (also known as Mochomo) is in prison. Edgar Valdez Villareal (also known as ""La Barbie"") is in a Mexico City prison awaiting extradition. El Mayo is still free, but Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman Loera, the most-wanted trafficker in the world, was captured on February 22, 2014 , countering conspiracy theories that the Sinaloa Federation was being protected by the Mexican authorities. The US Treasury Department considers top Sinaloa figure Esparragoza Moreno and Caro Quintero to be ""long-time trafficking partners."" (see chart below) It also named several companies, all located in the vicinity of Guadalajara in central Mexico, as belonging to Caro Quintero as fronts for illicit activity. This is significant in that it indicates he may still be involved in the drug trafficking business in some way, even if only with respect to financial ties. Regardless, the financial networks of Mexico's drug traffickers are perhaps the most important element of their illicit activity. As the drug trafficking patterns shift and products change, and focus moves from marijuana production to heroin, for example, the money continues to flow and needs to be laundered. Money laundering is likely Caro Quintero's relevance in the Mexican drug trade today. It is unlikely, given his many years of imprisonment, that he has any influence in the business of drug trafficking itself -- in spite of dated reports that he retained clout while imprisoned. The Caro Quintero affiliated companies named by the US Treasury Department include real estate ventures, gasoline retailers and agricultural businesses, indicating that money laundered by Caro Quintero is not small in quantity (in some instances regarding the Mexican drug cartels, the US Treasury Department has named smaller businesses, even daycare centers, as money laundering fronts, and these quite clearly can only sustain smaller quantities of illicit cash; agricultural enterprises and real estate tend to provide cover for much larger quantities of illicit funds). Also notable is the number of companies designated as connected to Caro Quintero by the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Sanctions have been placed on some 20 companies, suggesting that Caro Quintero still maintains a network through which to launder his money, rather than simply having a few outlets through which to keep movable cash. Whereabouts Unknown Where exactly Caro Quintero is located may be the clue to deciphering how much influence he still has in the drug business -- if he is located in a large cartel-ridden city like Guadalajara or Culiacan, it is likely he remains connected to the drug world and its leadership. If he is in the hills of Sinaloa, however, then he probably has little influence. Shortly after his release from prison, and following the US announcement regarding information leading to his capture, the Mexican Attorney General's Office (PGR) -- which disagreed with the court decision to set him free -- released a so-called red notice , alerting Interpol to his status and officially designating him as an international fugitive. The Mexican authorities admit they do not know his whereabouts. ""We had him and then he escaped [our grasp],"" Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said shortly after Caro Quintero's release. Caro Quintero, however, has reached out to the authorities himself. In late 2013, he sent a letter to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto asking that Mexican authorities not bow to US pressure. He has already served his time, he claimed, saying that his family does not deserve more ""persecution."" Still in Pursuit Caro Quintero's brother, Miguel Angel, was extradited to the United States in 2009 and charged a year later for conspiring to import marijuana and racketeering. He was sentenced to 17 years in prison in Denver in 2010. As a result, it is not likely that the authorities will feel the need to apprehend Rafael Caro Quintero to break down a family network. However, given that the Mexican Supreme Court has overturned the lower court's decision to set him free, not to mention the fact that Sinaloa leader Guzman claimed to have recently spoken with him , it is likely that Mexican authorities will continue to assist the United States in seeking his capture. It is also quite likely that in light of Sinaloa leader Guzman's declarations, US authorities may decide that Caro Quintero still has clout in the drug trafficking world and put pressure on Mexico to re-arrest him. One former DEA official recently told the El Paso Times that ruling out Caro Quintero as the ""jefe de jefes"" (boss of bosses) was impossible given the influence he had in the past. This indicates that at least some in the US intelligence community continue to view Caro Quintero as a serious threat. With that in mind, it is highly unlikely that Caro Quintero will spend the rest of his days living quietly in the hills of his home region of Sinaloa. *Malcolm Beith is a freelance journalist and author of The Last Narco: Inside the Hunt for El Chapo, the World's Most Wanted Drug Lord.

"Colombias Last Guerrillas Fight Over Cocaine Hub. On the same day that Colombia's biggest guerrilla group, the ELN, resumed peace talks with the government, reports emerged of a battle between the rebels and former guerrillas embedded in the main cocaine hub on the Venezuela border: the region of Catatumbo. The fighting -- between the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) and the former insurgents from the Popular Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Popular - EPL) on March 15 -- resulted in at least six deaths in the embattled region in the Norte de Santander department of northeast Colombia, El Espectador reported. The clashes occurred in Teorama municipality, according to El Colombiano. The spate of violence followed a failed meeting between the two groups, according to Colombia's top military commander, General Alberto Jose Mejia. ""No agreement was reached between [ELN and EPL] leaders and they decided to start killing each other,"" Mejia said , adding that they were fighting over ""drug trafficking, cocaine and the control of illegal crops."" Over the past few days, fighting between the two groups has affected 17,000 people in the municipalities of San Calixto, El Tarra, Teorama, Convencion, Hacari, El Carmen and Tibu, according to a United Nations report. The clashed have caused civilian and military casualties, and displacements. Map of the affected area c/o UN OCHA After several weeks of turmoil , the government and the ELN resumed peace talks in Ecuador on March 15. Both the ELN and the EPL, also known as the ""Pelusos,"" are involved in drug trafficking in Catatumbo, which has some of the densest coca fields in the country. Nowhere in the world is cocaine so cheap to produce, and its border with Venezuela provides a perfect drug route and refuge for armed fighters. Until recently, this type of fighting was relatively uncommon in this coveted corner of Colombia. The now-demobilized FARC, the ELN, and the EPL have cohabited in Catatumbo for years under a relatively fragile non-violence agreement. If clashes continue, victimizing the civilian population, they will further undermine the ongoing peace talks between the ELN and the Colombian government, talks that have already hit major snags. Violent actions by the ELN's more belligerent factions caused the talks to be suspended until recently."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Arrest Uncovers Costa Rica Drug Boss Sinaloa Cartel Links. Authorities have taken down the boss of the Moreco gang -- a uniquely powerful Costa Rica-based drug trafficking group with apparent ties to Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. Jose Efrain Lopez Mendoza, alias ""M-1,"" was arrested on August 13 while traveling in a vehicle on a San Jose highway, La Nacion reported. Authorities say Mendoza, who died his hair blonde and grew a beard to disguise himself from police, was the leader of the Revolutionary Movement of Organized Crime (Movimiento Revolucionario de Crimen Organizado -- Moreco), a Costa Rican trafficking group formed in 2015. Mendoza's arrest comes four months after he managed to elude capture during several nationwide raids targeting his organization. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had Mendoza on their most wanted lists after he was accused of trafficking more than two tons of cocaine to the United States. Los Moreco used its connections to groups in Colombia to import cocaine before then shipping it out to Guatemala, Mexico and the United States. Costa Rican authorities say Mendoza was in direct contact with Mexican kingpin Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias ""El Mayo,"" who has served as the head of the Sinaloa Cartel following the arrest and later conviction of Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias ""El Chapo."" Authorities may have dismantled Los Moreco with Mendoza's arrest, but the group represents a new type of threat for Costa Rica. The Central American nation has long served as a transit point for drugs trafficked to North America, with local organizations playing a supporting role in their movement. Los Moreco functioned differently, carrying out sophisticated and independent smuggling operations, while its leader also maintained ties with one of Mexico's most powerful criminal organizations. Los Moreco's ascendance likely stems from the fact that homegrown criminal groups in Costa Rica have for years sought to cement their role in the drug trade, partly by learning from Mexico's cartels. Former Attorney General Jorge Chavarria referred to this as the ""Mexicanization"" of Costa Rican criminal groups. In 2015, for example, Costa Rican hitmen traveled to Mexico to train with cartel assassins. Costa Rican groups also adopted the brutal methods of Mexican cartels, leading to an uptick in violence in 2017 and 2018, Chavarria said. In fact, Mendoza was so committed to having Los Moreco emulate Mexico's cartels that he fashioned the group after the murderous Zetas, using the same naming pattern as the group. Walter Espinoza, director of the Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Agency (Organismo de Investigacion Judicial - OIJ) , described Los Moreco as being a ""professional and structured"" group, with an ""ideology and a lot of internal cohesion."" The group even had its own motto: ""honor, pride and loyalty,"" he said. Los Moreco isn't the first group in Costa Rica to have ties to the Sinaloa Cartel. In 2016, authorities took down a drug trafficking network that imported cocaine from Ecuador and Colombia before shipping it to Mexico. The group had a smuggling system that included clandestine warehouses, docks, safe houses and airstrips. With the continued fragmentation of Mexico's dominant criminal organizations, groups like Los Moreco have more space to maneuver, allowing them to serve not just as facilitators but also partner organizations."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Murders of Soldiers Add Weight to Gang Conspiracy in El Salvador. Five soldiers have been murdered so far this year in El Salvador , lending credence to the claims of federal police that local ""maras,"" or street gangs, are plotting against the security forces. On Monday, unknown assailants gunned down military reservist Juan Antonio Lainez Rodriguez in the small town of San Francisco El Dorado, located in the north central Cabanas province. While members of El Salvador's National Civil Police (PNC) believe Lainez may simply have fallen victim to a robbery, they have not ruled out that his death may be part of a larger assault on the Salvadoran military and police by the country's street gangs. According to PNC investigators working the case, the number of bullet wounds he suffered (six, two in the face and four in the abdomen and legs) lends weight to this theory, suggesting that Lainez's attackers may have singled him out for more than his valuables. ""We know that the gangs have plans to kill soldiers, police and security guards, and plan on investigating this lead further,"" one of the investigators told La Prensa Grafica. Lainez Rodriguez's death is the fifth such murder of a soldier in 2012, and the second this month. On February 6, army corporal Jose Lorenzo Ramos was murdered in the western province of La Libertad, believed to have been shot dead by two gunmen riding a motorcycle. Two corporals and a sergeant were killed in two separate incidents in January. As InSight Crime reported, PNC deputy director Howard Cotto told local media in January that jailed leaders of the country's maras are planning an all-out attack on ""the system."" According to Cotto, police have intercepted messages from these gang bosses in which they instruct their lieutenants to target members of the security forces, including police, soldiers, judges and prosecutors. Given President Mauricio Funes push for a "" more forceful "" approach to the gang problem, with his recent shift towards a more militarized security strategy , such a plan could be seen as a kind of counteroffensive by the country's main gangs. It is unclear, however, whether Salvadoran gangs like the Mara Salvatrucha ( MS-13 ) and Barrio 18 have the nationwide organization to carry out such coordinated actions. Because of this, InSight Crime expressed skepticism over Cotto's warning, arguing that it had more to do with the politics of police reform, and was part of an attempt to portray the notoriously corrupt Salvadoran police as the ""good guys."" Ultimately, only time will tell if El Salvador's maras are in fact waging war on the country's security forces. While the five killings are alarming, they do not yet constitute a pattern. If more killings take place in the coming months, however, it could indicate that the country's gangs have reached a new level of organization. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Brazil Arrests Disrupt Red Commands Drug, Gun Supply. Authorities in Brazil have arrested two alleged top weapons and drug providers for Rio de Janeiro's notorious Red Command, potentially disrupting transnational supply lines for the powerful group as it faces security force pressure in one of its strongholds. Ricardo dos Santos Silva, alias ""Tubarao"" (Shark), was arrested on April 7 in western Rio de Janeiro, reported Estadao. According to Rio's 33rd Police Precinct, Silva smuggled drugs from Brazil's southern border cities of Ponta Pora and Foz do Iguacu into Rio favelas and areas surrounding the city, and was the largest supplier of drugs and weapons for the Red Command (Comando Vermelho). Another drug trafficker, Sidnei da Silva Araujo, alias ""Mangustao,"" was arrested on the same day , with falsified identity documents on his person. Da Silva is touted as the principal distributor of drugs and weapons in the slums of Nova Holanda and Parque Uniao in the Complexo da Mare -- a sprawling set of favelas in northern Rio largely controlled by the Red Command -- and allegedly brought drugs up from Paraguay. Around the time of the arrests, members of the armed forces were attacked by criminals in Complexo da Mare, shortly after they occupied the complex on April 5 as part of the city's slum pacification program, reported G1 Globo. The attacks occurred at at least five different points, with shots fired at soldiers patrolling the streets, following demonstrations to protest the pacification attempt. The arrests of the two traffickers shines light on the supply routes for the drugs and arms the Red Command needs for control and profit in Rio's favelas. Police reports suggest both men trafficked contraband originating in Paraguay, a key transit country for drugs and arms moving into Brazil, and one where the Red Command has reportedly established a presence. If it is true that the two men were among the gang's major drugs and arms suppliers, then their arrests would mark a significant setback for the Red Command, at a time when the group is simultaneously threatened by the militarization of favelas under its control. However, the attacks against security forces in Complexo da Mare, which has been a key base for the Red Command's operations, could be the latest indication that the gang is prepared to challenge attempts to break their hold on the favelas, in order to preserve its illegal enterprises.

"Paraguay Grants President Sweeping Military Powers. Paraguay has passed reforms expanding military powers in the fight against guerrilla insurgents, providing a convenient distraction from the more pressing issues of drug trafficking and organized crime -- which hit closer to home for President Horacio Cartes. The Paraguayan Senate passed reforms to the National Defense Law that grant far greater control of the military to the president's office, allowing Cartes to use soldiers anywhere in the country at any moment with the only proviso that the government must inform congress of the deployment within 48 hours, at which point congress can vote to end it. Previously, the government could only make such a deployment under a declared ""state of exception."" The government argued the law would enable authorities to respond more quickly and flexibly to the threat posed by the guerrilla insurgents of the Paraguayan People's Army (EPP). However, there has been strong criticism of the law, especially from rural social movements and human rights organizations. The National Roundtable of Peasant Organizations (MCNOC) issued a statement saying the law could lead to the kind of repressive military practices seen under dictator Alfredo Stroessner, while the Paraguay Human Rights Coordinator (Codehupy) declared the reforms installed ""a permanent state of exception, without time limits, and without the approval and control of the legislative body."" The reforms to the defense law have been pushed through at breakneck speed following the killing of five security guards in an attack earlier this week, which is believed to have been carried out by the EPP. The attack has allowed the new Paraguayan government to introduce legislation granting it sweeping powers while grandstanding on its hard line approach to the rebels. However, it also serves as a diversion from more serious problems. Although the EPP guerrillas have been stepping up activities in recent years, they remain little more than a persistent thorn in the state's side, and likely number less than 100 fighters. The far more serious challenge facing Paraguay is drug trafficking and the growing presence of organized crime. On the day the reforms passed, this was underlined by the mayor of border city San Carlos del Apa, Luis Anibal Schupp, who publicly stated that 80 percent of ranches and estates in the area were owned by powerful narcos. However, as Cartes has himself been accused of involvement in money laundering, drug trafficking, and contraband smuggling, the EPP make for a much more comfortable target."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Chavez Blasts US Travel Warning, Plays Down Venezuela Violence. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez reacted angrily to a US State Department travel warning pointing to the ""pervasiveness"" of violent crime in Venezuela. However, the president's comments neglect both the facts and the seriousness of Venezuela's precarious position. Speaking from Cuba, where he is receiving treatment following the recent removal of a cancerous tumour in his pelvis, Chavez criticized the travel warning issued by the US State Department that says Venezuela has one of the top five highest murder rates in the world. The State Department cites statistics from the Venezuelan Violence Observatory (OVV), an NGO that says 2011 was Venezuela's most violent year ever with 19,336 murders. The Venezuelan president responded on Tuesday, stating, ""Where would there be greater lack of public security on the streets? In Venezuela or in the United States? Let's look at the figures,"" reports the Associated Press. On the same day as Chavez's comments, Venezuelan Interior and Justice Minister Tareck El Aissami announced that more than 89,000 police officers will soon enroll in the state university dedicated to training the security forces, the Experimental Security University (UNES). This is part of Venezuela's ongoing efforts to expand the National Bolivarian Police (PNB), a new police force created in 2009 in order to better confront rising crime rates. Chavez's indignance is, to say the least, misplaced. A recent report from the*Metropolitan Observatory on Citizen Security (OMSC) echoed the OVV's conclusion that 2011 was Venezuela's most violent year on record, though it provided a more conservative number of just under 19,000 homicides, equating to a muder rate of 66 per 100,000 inhabitants. In the capital Caracas, the 2011 murder rate stands at 108 per 100,000, according to the OMSC. In comparison, the most violent city in the US last year, New Orleans, registered a murder rate of roughly 57 per 100,000 inhabitants. While Venezuela saw violence rise steadily over the last decade, homicides have gone down in the US. Based on FBI figures , the national per capita murder rate currently stands at 4.8 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010, less than half the numbers registered two decades ago (9.8 per 100,000). Chavez's comparisons are also senseless because Venezuela faces a far more uncertain future in terms of public security. Chavez's challenger in this year's presidential elections, Henrique Capriles Radonski, has a poor record on security issues: while serving as governor of Miranda, the state became one of the most violent in the country. If Capriles is to win, there are also fears that leftist armed groups could rise to prominence, possibly becoming an insurgency. The ongoing plans to expand the PNB may be the government's best bet at stemming the violence, although it is difficult to measure the full effectiveness of the force. The PNB director has said that murders have dropped by as much as 60 percent in the Caracas neighborhoods where the police units are active, but he is arguably under pressure to spin good results. The PNB are not scheduled to fully replace the local and state police forces until some time next year. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Confirms Death of Narco-Guerrilla Megateo. Security forces announced they had finally killed the leader of a guerrilla group dedicated to drug trafficking along the Venezuelan border, who had built up his splinter faction into a drug trafficking force, a potential model in a post-conflict Colombia. President Juan Manuel Santos confirmed via Twitter that guerrilla leader Victor Ramon Navarro Cervano, alias ""Megateo,"" the leader of the last faction of the People's Liberation Army (EPL), was killed in a military and police operation in Norte de Santander department. Info reciente inteligencia FFAA confirma:Megateo abatido.GRAN GOLPE Felicitaciones! Criminales o sometidos a justicia o terminan bajo tierra -- Juan Manuel Santos (JuanManSantos) October 2, 2015 Megateo had previously been reported killed in an attack in August. However, he managed to escape thanks to his ring of bodyguards that took the brunt of the military's attack, according to a report by El Tiempo. A special force of 350 police and military officials have been carrying out an intense manhunt for the guerrilla leader, who over the past eight years has previously managed to escape 50 operations intended to either capture or kill him, according to Semana. El Colombiano reported that Megateo and at least two other people died after he fumbled with a grenade he was trying to throw at a helicopter during an attack against his camp. An analysis of human remains recovered from the camp confirmed that among the dead was Megateo. Megateo led an armed group that was once part of the EPL that officially demobilized in 1991; however, some elements remained active around Megateo's hometown in rural Norte de Santander. In the early 2000s, Megateo established himself as the leader of the remainder EPL, and deepened their involvement in the coca production and cocaine trafficking trade. Megateo earned millions thanks to drug trafficking, and became known for his penchant for fancy jewelry and beautiful women. The US State Department also viewed him as a top drug trafficker in the region, and offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. Thanks to his ability to elude capture, Megateo was seen as the ""Robin Hood"" of the underdeveloped and long-neglected region of Catatumbo, which lies along the border with Venezuela. He managed to build up a tiny reduct of an extinct rebel group into a multi-million dollar drug business, by acting as a broker for other illegal groups involved in the drug trade in the region, including the Urabenos, the Rastrojos, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). The Colombian government has had success in targeting guerrilla leaders -- especially those from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) -- via air strikes. The fact that it took as long as it did to successfully take down Megateo is a reminder of how many resources these operations need, and how criminals with strong links to the local population can hide themselves. Megateo's long criminal career could yet provide a model for other FARC commanders who may be unwilling to demobilize and abandon their involvement in the drug trade, should the FARC sign a peace deal. There is still a strong possibility that in a post-conflict scenario, mid-level FARC leaders could follow Megateo's path, and dedicate themselves to running mini-criminal empires in rural areas that the state has never fully controlled. Even with Megateo gone, this is unlikely to affect the coca and cocaine trade in the Norte de Santander area once under his control. This is a strategic hub for the drug trade due to its proximity with Venezuela and while it is unclear whether Megateo had any potential successor within the EPL, his allies, the FARC and the ELN, are present in the region and could take control of the drug business."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
New Regs for Uruguay Marijuana Law Aim to Prevent Trafficking. Uruguay has announced many of the finer details of its marijuana legalization legislation, with regulations that demonstrate a concerted effort to minimize the risk of large-scale trafficking. According to the new law's official regulations ( pdf ), Uruguayan citizens and permanent residents will be able to cultivate a maximum of six cannabis plants per household -- based on a yield of 480 grams per year -- for personal use. They can also join a cannabis club and buy up to 10 grams a week at a pharmacy authorized to sell the drug. The government is also offering an amnesty allowing individual growers to register existing plants. During a press conference outlining the law's newly thrashed out details, the secretary general of Uruguay's National Drug Council (JND) Julio Calzada announced that these will also limit commercial marijuana production to 10 hectares of state land to cover the country's estimated 18 to 22 ton annual consumption, reported El Pais. Between two and six private companies will be granted permits to produce marijuana, reported El Observador. Commercial crop cultivations will be watched over by state security forces, with producers set to foot the bill for their presence. The security guarantees and limits demonstrate an encouraging attempt to allow sufficient production while guarding against criminals taking advantage of the drug's legal status. The use of state land for large-scale production will act as a shield against illegal cultivation, as well as making identification of legal plantations a clear-cut process. However, both unlicensed cultivation and the risk of large-scale trafficking remain a risk. As InSight Crime pointed out in December, controlling the balance of marijuana production will be crucial. Too much restriction could encourage consumers to turn to the black market -- including illegal imports from South America's primary producer Paraguay, which has already expressed concerns regarding the law -- while excessive freedom would bolster the arguments of the legislation's many critics and increase the risk of trafficking. The main feat for the government in the near future will be to crack down on unlicensed growth and encourage participation in the legal market, which should be made easier by the reasonable price of state-controlled marijuana -- roughly $1 per gram. Despite President Jose Mujica's concerns regarding the entry of cheaper Paraguayan marijuana into the country, the fixed price is comparable to its current retail value in the country, according to the United Nations.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexican State Bans Narco-Music. A Mexican governor announced a prohibition on ""narcocorridos,"" songs celebrating drug trafficking, in public venues in his state, turning the fight against organized crime into a debate about free expression amid the rise of narco-culture. The northwestern state of Sinaloa's ban on narcocorridos, songs which typically hail the exploits of drug traffickers against a backdrop of old-style Mexican rhythms heavy on percussion and accordion, will be enforced through local alcohol regulations. Bars and music halls that are in violation of the new statute will have their liquor license yanked. The move by Governor Mario Lopez Valdez earned a thumbs-up from federal authorities. Alejandro Poire, one of President Felipe Calderon's most visible security officials, said that the songs ""glorify the most perverse examples of criminal violence, capable of inhuman massacres."" After announcing his decree, Lopez Valdez later said that he'd like to see the ban replicated nationally. Despite the flurry of approval, it is not clear how any of this will have an impact on public security in Sinaloa , the Mexican state with the deepest historical connections to the drug trade. As Lopez Valdez surely knows, the reasons that Sinaloa has long suffered high levels of violence -- weak institutions, large swaths of lawless regions in the Sierra Madre mountains, terrain ideal for marijuana cultivation, among many other factors -- will be entirely unaffected by his decree. Narcocorridos are merely a symptom of the above challenges, and a relatively unimportant one at that. As a result, Valdez Lopez is restricting free expression without any probable security benefit. Nor, for that matter, is the ban on narcocorridos likely to eliminate the music. Unless the state government is prepared to send an army of undercover inspectors to cantinas, flouting the law will presumably be both frequent and easy. Even if the law is successful, narcocorridos won't disappear; they will merely be driven underground, which may well enhance their credibility and could conceivably have the perverse affect of making them more popular. Lopez Valdez's gambit is not the first time that narcocorridos have been targeted by politicians. In 2009, a deputy from Calderon and Lopez Valdez's Natinal Action Party, Oscar Marin Arce, introduced legislation to punish authors of narcocorridos with up to three years in prison. However, the law was never passed. Some Latin American politicians have also expressed disapproval of ""narconovelas,"" or TV soap operas that offer occasionally sympathetic portrayals of capos. In 2010, Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli complained that the narconovelas ""exalt"" drug runners and corrupt values, and alluded to the possibility of restrictive new laws if broadcasters refused to self-regulate their content. As with Lopez Valdez, those behind the Martinelli and Marin proposals must be aware that the huge profits and probability of escaping arrest are the primary drivers of organized crime in Latin America, not the relatively insignificant presence of the drug trade in popular culture. As such, their criticism of novelas and corridos are better viewed as political saber-rattling rather than a serious attempt to address insecurity. ""It is very hard to stop the drug trafficking, [but it] is very easy to get your name in the papers by attacking famous musicians."" said Elijah Wald, the author of the book ""Narcocorrido: A Journey into the Music of Drugs, Guns, and Guerrillas,"" said in response to Marin Arce's proposal. Nonetheless, the authors of narcocorridos are often connected to conflicts in the world of organized crime, even beyond the lyrics in their songs. In perhaps the most famous case, famous crooner Valentin Elizalde was murdered in Reynosa in 2007. While the motivation for his death has never been positively established, one popular theory said that he was killed in retaliation for singing the song ""A Mis Enemigos,"" or To My Enemies, a provocative insult to unnamed adversaries, on the night of his death. Under that theory, the unnamed enemies were in fact the Zetas , some of whom were in the audience and recognized the challenge. ""Jefe de Jefes"" by Los Tigres del Norte is among the most famous narcocorridos in Mexico (See video below). Although many capos have adopted the moniker, the song is said to pay homage to Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, who was the nation's most notorious capo during the 1980s. Felix Gallardo, who has now been in prison more than 20 years, has said that he doesn't like the song or the style of music. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Urabenos Leader to Be Tried as Criminal. The founder of the Urabenos will be tried as a criminal and not a demobilized paramilitary, following a court ruling on a case that marks the dividing line between Colombia's paramilitary movement and their criminal successors known as the BACRIM. A judge from the Justice and Peace Tribunal -- a court set up to handle the demobilization of the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), the rightwing paramilitary umbrella group that demobilized in the mid-2000s -- ruled that Daniel Rendon Herrera, alias ""Don Mario,"" did not qualify to be tried as part of the process. Although Don Mario appeared on the list of AUC chiefs to be tried under the demobilization law, which would see him recieve a maximum 8-year sentence, the court ruled his continued criminal activities after 2006 made him ineligible. Among the evidence cited by the judge were intercepted phone calls in which members of the Urabenos referred to Don Mario as their leader, and a document written by one of Don Mario's main successors, the now deceased Juan de Dios Usuga David, alias ""Giovanni,"" in which he stated Don Mario was his boss and had ordered the kidnapping of 25 people. Don Mario admitted rearming and forming the Heroes of Castano bloc on the orders of notorious AUC chief Vicente Castano. However, he said he had only done so because Castano told him that drug lord and paramilitary leader Diego Murillo, alias ""Don Berna,"" planned to kill them. In the coming weeks, Don Mario, who was arrested in 2009, will be charged with aggravated criminal conspiracy in Colombia. He may later face extradition to the United States, reported El Colombiano. Vicente Castano was murdered in 2007, most likely at the hands of his AUC associates. Don Mario quickly moved to seize control of the operation and began operating under the name, the Gaitanista Self-Defense Forces, which would later become the Urabenos. While the end of the demobilization of the AUC in 2006 is often cited as the beginning of the era of the narco-paramilitary successor groups known as the BACRIM (from Spanish ""Bandas Criminales"" or ""Criminal Bands""), it is arguable that the loss of the AUC leadership to violence or extradition in 2007 and 2008 marks the true dividing line between the criminal epochs. It was at this time that mid-level commanders such as Don Mario took control of AUC remnants and began shaping the BACRIM. The judge's decision to try Don Mario as head of the Urabenos and not as a Vicente Castano's finance chief and hatchet man rightly reflects this shift. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexico State Violence a Reflection of Chaotic Underworld. Mexico's gangland violence is licking once again at the crowded and chaotic edges of the nation's capital, claiming more than two score lives since January 14 and illustrating again how chopping off the head of an organization can lead to turmoil below. Officials blame a war between the Familia Michoacana and an alliance formed by two breakaway groups: the Caballeros Templarios, or Knights Templar , and a recently formed gang called the Guerreros Unidos. Smaller cells of the Zetas may also be in the mix, according to police in Mexico state, which encloses Mexico City like a cupped hand. At least 46 people have been killed gangland style in a week , including 16 killed last Monday in and around Toluca, Mexico state's capital and another 14 murdered in the sprawling working class bedroom communities on Mexico City's eastern flanks. Authorities tie the current slaughter to a feud between Jose Maria Chavez-Magana, the purported boss of the Familia Michoacana in Mexico state, and several of his former lieutenants, who split with him over money issues last spring and who have since allied with the Knights Templar and Guerreros Unidos. According to the newspaper Reforma's version of events, Guerreros Unidos was founded by Mario Covarrubias Salgado, nicknameed ""El M"" o ""El Gordo"" (the Fat Man), a former underling of the Beltran Leyva crime family. He had briefly joined the Familia Michoacana after Mexican marines killed clan boss Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009, but quickly left to start his own group. Banners signed by the Familia have accused Mexican state police officials of allying with Guerreros Unidos. Renewed violence in Mexico state again throws into question the effectiveness of the US-supported kingpin strategy of former President Felipe Calderon, which focused on taking down the country's 37 most important gangsters in order to disrupt their trafficking networks and splinter their gangs into less threatening sizes. Critics, including Mexico's new attorney general, Jesus Murrillo-Karam , say the strategy spawns even more violence as former gang lords' underlings turn on one another to inherit the the criminal empires. That appears to be what's happening now in the state of Mexico. Federal officials had assured Mexicans that Familia Michoacana -- whose brutal falling out with the Zetas in 2006 initiated the hyper-violence still racking the country -- was finished following the reported December 2010 killing by security forces of of Nazario Moreno , nicknamed "" the Craziest One ."" Moreno had instilled the Familia Michoacana with a quasi-religious ethic along with its criminal livelihood. Soon after Moreno's disappearance, his Familia underbosses split into antagonistic factions, several creating the Knights Templar and going to war with the remnants of Familia and other gangs in west-central Mexico. Moreno's death has always been questioned -- his body was never recovered following the shootout in which he was reported killed. And press reports last fall claimed that new evidence seized by security forces suggest he's still alive and perhaps directing the Knights Templar. Sources also tell InSight Crime the crime boss has called local business leaders to meetings to discuss regular extortion payments. Whether he's dead or alive, Moreno's exit from active control of the Familia broke up what was once a cohesive -- if brutal and politically threatening -- gang into viciously warring fragments. Those slivers now are fighting for control of retail drug sales and wholesale trafficking routes in the states of Mexico, Guerrero and Michoacan. The gangs likely have been joined by some former members of the Beltran Leyva Organization , which splintered following Arturo's death by Mexican naval special forces troops. Led by Arturo's brother Hector , the Beltran Leyvas are still active but their influence has waned in Mexico state and Mexico City's suburbs since the August 2010 arrest of Arturo's lieutenant, Edgar Valdez Villarreal , known as La Barbie. President Enrique Pena Nieto, who served as Mexico state's governor during the Familia's rise to power there, has vowed to focus more on reducing violence than attacking drug trafficking or kingpins. Some analysts have suggested that strategy must entail negotiating peace with at least some of the gangs. Even if Pena were open to such talks, the kaleidoscoped reality of Mexico's underworld today -- evidenced by Mexico state's ongoing bloodshed -- makes them difficult to achieve at best."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Did the Zetas Force US Agents Killer to Surrender?The Zetas forced one of their henchmen to surrender to the authorities after killing a US agent last year, in the hope of heading off a Washington-backed offensive against the group, according to a captured lieutenant. The shooting of Homeland Security investigator Jaime Zapata on February 15, 2011, was the most high-profile murder of a US agent in Mexico since the death of Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Enrique Camarena in 1985. Camarena's torture and execution led to increased pressure from the US, prompting Mexico to crack down on the Guadalajara Cartel, which was held responsible for the killing. After Zapata's death the pressure was once again on Mexico to make arrests. Within eight days, the Mexican security forces had netted Julian Zapata Espinoza, alias ""El Piolin,"" who is suspected of ordering the ambush which killed Zapata. He has already been extradited to the US. At the time, President Barack Obama reportedly called President Felipe Calderon to congratulate him on the timely arrest. But the story told by another captured Zetas lieutenant, Luis Jesus Sarabia, alias ""Comandante Pepito,"" (see photo, above) is that his comrade was actually ordered to surrender by the Zetas high command. If true, this would cast doubt on the Mexican Army's account of the arrest. Before his arrest in January 2012, Sarabia oversaw the Zetas' operations in four states, including San Luis Potosi, where Zapata died. According to Proceso , Sarabia told authorities that Espinoza was under orders to ""rob trucks"" along the region's most important road, Highway 57. When they saw Zapata's armored Chevy Suburban driving by, they forced the vehicle to stop. During the ensuing struggle to open the vehicle's door, Zapata was shot and killed. Shortly after the incident, Sarabia reportedly met with the Zetas' top commander Miguel Angel Trevino, alias "" Z-40 ,"" who demanded an explanation from him. Afterwards, according to Sarabia, the Zetas leadership decided that Espinoza would either be killed or handed over to the authorities. How much does Sarabia's account clash with the government's version of events? The two stories may not be mutually exclusive. One source told InSight Crime that Zetas boss Heriberto Lazcano, alias "" Z-3 ,"" was so spooked by Zapata's death that he ordered his men to stop providing protection for Espinoza. He also decided not to transfer him out of San Luis Potosi, which increased the chance that he would be captured (he did transfer Sarabia, who was deployed permanently to Monclova in March 2011, according to Proceso's account). US agencies, meanwhile, may have contributed human intelligence which would have assisted the Mexican military in identifying and detaining Espinoza so quickly. It seems as though the Zetas did not order Espinoza to surrender, but left him in San Luis Potosi without support, in the full knowledge that the government's attention was fixed on the area and that he would likely be picked up. The security forces may be able to claim credit for the capture, but the Zetas arguably made it easy for them. This raises the question of why the Zetas were willing to sacrifice one of their own. It is likely because Lazcano understood that Zapata's death would bring a disproportionate response from the Mexican security forces, under pressure from the US. Giving up the immediate culprits could mollify the US and stem a nationwide offensive against the Zetas, allowing them to carry on with business as usual. Sarabia's testimony gives an idea of how much the Zetas wish to avoid engaging with the US, suggesting that the group's leadership fears becoming the principal target of US agencies. There are signs, however, that this is fast becoming the case. The US government appeared to signal an intention to bring renewed focus to the fight against the Zetas, when the Obama administration officially named them a significant transnational criminal organization last year. The Mexican government also revamped their security strategy, naming the Zetas as their top priority in 2011. If anything, Sarabia's account points to the Zetas' fear of attracting the attention of the US authorities. It is up to both US and Mexican agencies to figure out how to best use that fear as a weapon against the group. "	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Colombia Drug Possession Decree Misses Mark. The seizure of more than 7 metric tons of drugs from users in nine days in Colombia after a decree effectively banning personal drug use has been heralded a success by authorities. However, questions remain as to whether targeting drug users will prove effective in tackling the root causes of Colombia's drug problems. An October 1 decree by Colombian President Ivan Duque authorized police to confiscate and destroy any quantity of drugs found on a person, abolishing the Constitutional Court given right for users to carry small doses of drugs for personal use. Under the decree, people found with less than 20 grams of marijuana, 1 gram of cocaine or 2 grams of synthetic drugs can be fined 208,000 Colombian pesos (almost $70), the equivalent of around one week's minimum wage in Colombia. Those found with more than the minimum dose can be detained and referred to judicial authorities. A court hearing would determine whether confiscated supplies correspond to personal possession or intent to sell. In the nine days after the decree was signed, authorities confiscated 7.2 metric tons of narcotics across Colombia, El Colombiano reported. Police also levied fines against 8,012 citizens and arrested 718 people. ""We are going to go after dealers on the street, and we are going to prosecute them,"" President Duque announced at a press conference last week, stating that the decree would form an integral part of his new drug policy. However, the decree has proved controversial. The Council of State will now decide whether to nullify the decree , after members of Congress launched an initiative to request the removal of the article allowing police to confiscate drug quantities below minimum dose. Congress members state the decree violates various aspects of the constitution and puts consumers at risk, El Tiempo reported. The effective ban on drug consumption indicates the beginning of President Duque's move towards a more hardline, repressive drug policy of the kind that has traditionally had little success in Colombia. The decree is more likely to affect low-level users than combat rising consumption and microtrafficking. Duque's approach, which goes against growing international consensus towards more regulatory or preventative policies that focus on users' safety and lessen the dominance of criminal organizations, is likely to do little less than criminalize users. His approach presents a number of practical problems. Firstly, Colombia can hardly afford to increase its prison population. Prisons across the country are operating at almost 50 percent overcapacity, with 36,452 more people currently awaiting sentence, according to El Espectador. Such figures indicate that neither the penitentiary nor the judicial systems have the capacity or resources to handle the increase in inmates that will result from President Duque's new decree. Secondly, this punitive approach does not take into consideration the root causes of consumption and trafficking, without which tackling the problem is close to impossible. ""The decree will not help to reduce consumption, and could have the adverse effect with regards to distribution,"" Professor Yesid Reyes Alvarado of the Externado University of Colombia told Semana. ""Consumers are going to buy back every gram that is confiscated from them."" According to the Colombian Drug Observatory (Observatorio de Drogas de Colombia - ODC), the focus must be on improving the living conditions and social integration of those affected by the local illicit drug market. The imprisonment of low-level offenders, recreational users and addicts can further isolate the subject and increase their susceptibility to involvement in criminal behavior. At a time when Colombian criminal groups are increasingly stimulating drug markets within the local population , finding social solutions is perhaps more important than ever."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Guatemala Arrests Former Top Interior, Police Officials for Corruption. Authorities in Guatemala have arrested a former vice-minister of the interior and police director on corruption charges, demonstrating how officials systematically used government contracts to rob the state during the tenure of former Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla. Guatemala's Attorney General's Office announced on January 30 via Twitter the arrests of former Interior Vice Minister Manfredo Vinicio Pacheco Consuegra and the former head of the National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil - PNC), Walter Rene Vasquez Ceron. The two are accused of having illegally awarded five government contracts for the rental of 47 bulletproof vehicles during 2014 and 2015. The former director of the penitentiary system, Anthony Giovanni Pivaral de Leon, is also implicated in the scheme, reported Prensa Libre. The government contracts, worth a total of 32 million quetzals (roughly $4.3 million), were awarded without a bidding process. This was allegedly done by invoking an exemption that is allowed for certain cases under Guatemalan law. But these ""extraordinary cases"" are only allowed for contracts up to 90,000 quetzals (approximately $12,000), according to Prensa Libre. The Attorney General's Office also said via Twitter that former Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla illegally approved the terms of the deal ""via ministerial resolution."" Prosecutors will request a preliminary hearing for Lopez Bonilla, who is currently detained on several corruption charges related to a separate case. Under Lopez Bonilla, at least seven Interior ministry contracts were awarded by invoking the ""extraordinary cases"" exemption, according to Prensa Libre. The arrest of the two former officials is emblematic of the methodical corruption that took place within Guatemala's Interior ministry while Lopez Bonilla was at the helm. The over-inflation of government contracts was so widespread that the Interior ministry nearly went bankrupt, an official speaking on condition of anonymity told InSight Crime as part of a recent investigation into Lopez Bonilla. SEE ALSO : Impunity in the Northern Triangle Armored vehicles in particular have been involved in several instances of alleged corruption concerning the Interior ministry. The infamous and powerful prisoner Byron Lima -- who was killed during a prison riot last July -- would reportedly travel in a convoy of bulletproof vehicles owned by the Interior ministry during his regular trips to visit his family and friends outside the prison. InSight Crime's investigation also found that Lopez Bonilla himself approved the allocation of resources, including an armored vehicle, for the protection of Marllory Chacon Rossell, who in 2012 the US government had identified as Guatemala's ""most active money launderer."""	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexicos Failure to Gather Quality Homicide Data Impeding Security Gains. Mexico's failure to gather quality data on homicides is preventing the country from developing effective policies to tackle rising violence, a new study found. The report , developed by the Institute for Economics and Peace, concluded that state authorities across Mexico complied on average with just 14.8 of the 43 indicators established by international standards that are needed to obtain quality and useful homicide data. The states of Nuevo Leon, Queretaro, Aguascalientes, Baja California and Coahuila scored the highest on the index, while Mexico City, Yucatan, Nayarit, Tabasco and Hidalgo scored the lowest. However, not one state achieved a score higher than 29 out of the ideal 43, meaning that authorities in Mexico are severely lacking the information needed to fully understand the different types of homicides taking place across the country. Violence in Mexico has skyrocketed in recent years, with 2017 being the most homicidal year in the country since official statistics started being kept more than a decade ago. Official figures for the first eight months of 2018 suggest homicides may again break records this year, according to Excelsior. Authorities in Mexico do not distinguish between homicides committed by criminal organizations and others, which is one of the problems identified in the report. However, independent researchers who crosschecked official figures and media reports estimate the figure could be as high as 75 percent. The report by the Institute for Economics and Peace is right to argue that quality data is key to developing effective policies and practices to tackle rising homicides, and it might also give Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador some clues on how to deal with one of the most pressing issues his administration will face when taking office on December 1. ""The reality is that we cannot solve a problem we can't understand,"" Talia Hagerty, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Economics and Peace, told InSight Crime. ""The way you prevent a homicide inside of a family is radically different from the way you prevent violence between two transnational criminal organizations. And the policy implications of knowing the difference are huge."" The report says that one of the reasons why Mexico scores low on the index is the gap between the number of homicides recorded by the health system and by law enforcement agencies, in addition to state authorities' failure to document homicides in a consistent way, which prevents the development of national trends. It also points to the lack of detail in the information recorded by authorities, particularly on key aspects of a crime including location and the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator, which is critical to establishing the type of violence involved (domestic, political, organized crime, etc). ""In some cases, these issues are the result of a lack of resources while in others it is a matter of corruption and impunity. The key is to get to the bottom of that in order to figure out what the problem is and how to fix it,"" Hagerty said. But the author argues that the solution depends on the state's willingness to implement common standards to document homicides and independent verification mechanisms. ""The solution is not just to throw money at the problem but to figure out where to invest. The most obvious investment would be to continue to rely on the armed forces, which is not giving the best results. Mexico needs to build capacity in states to be able to document homicides better, for example, by developing independent bodies,"" Hagerty said. ""Mexico needs to bring down homicides in the short-term but build up the necessary institutions to ensure positive peace is a reality in the long-term."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombian Indigenous Group Tries to Drive Out Army. Indigenous groups in Cauca province on Colombia's Pacific have clashed with the army, driving soldiers away from a military base after demanding that the armed forces and FARC rebels both withdraw from their land. On July 17, hundreds of members of the Nasa tribe attacked soldiers guarding Berlin hill in the Toribio municipality, where telecommunications towers are located. The Nasa began climbing the hill at 6 a.m., reported Vanguardia , in a group including including women, children, and elderly people, and clashed with soldiers. The troops were under orders not to respond with force, and dramatic images in El Espectador show a uniformed soldier being lifted in the air and dragged from his post by a group armed with sticks. One soldier reportedly fired shots into the air in frustration, but that there were no serious injuries in the clashes. (See video footage of clash, below.) The army said it had temporarily withdrawn to avoid further clashes. The Associated Press reported that six soldiers were removed, while the BBC said the Nasa reported the number at around 100, and Vanguardia put the number at 30. The army retook control of the hill in the early hours of the next morning. Representatives of the indigenous groups said that some 26 of them had been wounded, as the army used stun grenades and rubber bullets, reported El Liberal. The Colombian government may use even greater force if there are more clashes with the Nasa. Cauca is a crucially important region, and the authorities are unlikely to allow residents to eject them from it. President Juan Manuel Santos made this clear after the protests, saying ""we will not cede a single centimeter of Cauca or of the national territory,"" while police Colonel Ricardo Alarcon told the press that the hill was an important strategic site for operations against the guerrillas. Cauca is a crucial location for the rebels, as it is part of a corridor connecting the coca-producing interior of the country to the Pacific coast, from which drug shipments are launched. As well as the FARC, it is home to the National Liberation Army ( ELN ) rebel group and the Rastrojos drug gang, who have formed a loose alliance. The region has seen some of the worst combat between guerrillas and government forces in recent years. Fighting has been raging in the Toribio region for the last two weeks, killing at least three civilians and displacing thousands. The government has attempted to link the protests with the FARC. Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon claimed the indigenous groups had been infiltrated by the rebels, saying ""we know that this is what the FARC want, to generate a confrontation, but our army is very professional,"" reported El Espectador. The incident could be damaging for President Juan Manuel Santos, who has come under criticism for recent deteriorations in security in the country. He has changed his planned schedule to go to Cauca and deal with the situation first hand, saying on his Twitter account ""I don't want to see a single indigenous person on an army base,"" El Espectador reported.

Belize Free Trade Zone Emerges as Cigarette Smuggling Hub. A free trade zone in Belize's Corozal district has become a hub for the regional contraband cigarette trade, highlighting both Belize's role in regional smuggling and how the lax customs regulations in such zones create criminal opportunities. Black market cigarettes from countries such as India, China, Switzerland, Paraguay, and Panama are sold in Belize's northeast border region, tax free and for a fraction of their normal legal price, according to elPeriodico. An official from tobacco company Phillip Morris International (PMI), who accompanied ElPeriodico's reporters to Corozal, negotiated the purchase of 10.8 million cigarettes -- a quantity that would normally cost a Guatemalan retailer $500,000 -- for $314,000. According to PMI, the majority of cigarettes enter Belize via a Paraguay-Uruguay-Panama route, and then usually leave Belize by land over the border with Guatemala or Mexico, in vans packed with merchandise. The percentage of contraband cigarettes sold in other Central American nations illustrate the breadth of the trade. According to ElPeriodico's numbers, 18 percent of cigarettes sold in Guatemala are contraband, compared to 11.7 percent in El Salvador, 10 percent in Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and 70 percent in Panama. There are plenty of indications that Belize plays a particularly significant role in the regional contraband cigarette trade. In early June, officials in Guatemala's Peten department discovered an abandoned truck with three million contraband cigarettes , believed to have originated from Belize. Inspections of stores in Aguascalientes, Mexico by Mexican authorities led to the seizure of 145 thousand contraband cigarettes allegedly sourced from Belize. Belize's prominent role in the contraband trade is likely enhanced by its porous borders, lack of security measures and rugged geography, all factors which have contributed to a rise in organized crime activity in the country in recent years. Corozal is not the only free trade zone to attract the attention of criminals. In Colon, Panama, drug traffickers use the zone to launder profits , purchasing goods which are then shipped to Colombia and sold at a discount price, converting drug dollars into Colombian pesos.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Diego Rastrojo Extradited from Colombia: The End of the Rastrojos?The extradition to the United States of the founder of the Rastrojos, at one time Colombia's most powerful criminal syndicate, signals the end of the group and the triumph of their rivals, the Urabenos. Under heavy guard, Diego Perez Henao, alias ""Diego Rastrojo,"" was handed over to US authorities in a secure section of Bogota's international airport. His extradition closes not one, but two, chapters of Colombia's criminal history. The illegal armed group he set up, the Rastrojos, was initially part of the Norte del Valle Cartel (NDVC), a second-generation drug smuggling organization that dominated the cocaine trade from 1995 onwards. After 2006 and the demobilization of the paramilitary army of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), the Rastrojos became the most powerful of the third generation of Colombian cartels, dubbed the BACRIM (after the Spanish ""bandas criminales"") by the government. The Rastrojos leader was captured in neighboring Venezuela in June 2012. There he was overseeing one of the principal Rastrojos drug smuggling routes which saw tons of cocaine moved from Colombia into Venezuela, and then onwards to Central America and the US, or Europe. Diego Rastrojo is to answer charges of moving multi-ton drug consignments during a criminal career stretching over 20 years. Rastrojo started this career running cocaine laboratories in the southern department of Narino until he was called upon by Wilber Varela, head of one of the factions of the NDVC, to form a military force to take on a rival faction's armed wing, ""Los Machos,"" who fought for Diego Montoya. Varela was later murdered, in 2008, by Rastrojo and another top lieutenant, Javier Calle Serna, alias ""Comba."" The two men then formed the top command of the Rastrojos and were responsible for an impressive military expansion of the group across at least 12 of Colombia's 32 departments. SEE ALSO : Diego Rastrojo Profile In Colombia, Diego Rastrojo is under investigation for at least 66 murders , just between 2008 and 2012. He is believed to have been involved in multiple forced displacements and a series of kidnappings for ransom, as well as drug trafficking. Two criminal chapters have been closed with the extradition of Diego Rastrojo. The first is that of the NDVC -- this cartel has now seen all of its principal leaders either killed or captured. The more controversial question is whether his exit from the scene is also the death knell of the Rastrojos. Diego Rastrojo was the military head of the Rastrojos and was an architect of its rapid expansion from 2006-2012. One of the ways he consolidated the military power of the group was to make an alliance with elements of the National Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia's second rebel group, in the Pacific provinces of Cauca and Narino. These two departments, along with Valle del Cauca, became the strongholds of the Rastrojos and allowed them to dominate drug trafficking along the Pacific Coast and later project themselves across the country into Venezuela. The alliance with the ELN secured the Rastrojos access to coca crops in areas under guerrilla control, as well as ""safe areas"" to operate drug laboratories and escort services for cocaine shipments heading down to departure points along the Pacific Coast. In return, the ELN received weapons, money and communications equipment, which allowed the group to beat back challenges from the larger rebel movement the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which was at that time seeking to take over ELN territory. The two rebel groups are now allied. The Rastrojos were major suppliers of cocaine to Mexico's most powerful transnational criminal organization, the Sinaloa Cartel. With the implosion of the group, Mexican buyers have been spotted seeking new suppliers in Colombia, looking to guarantee the flow of cocaine northwards. There are indications that the Mexicans have established direct ties with the FARC rebels. The Rastrojos had two main wings: the mainly urban one, led by Comba, and the rural one, commanded by Diego Rastrojo. Comba gave up much of his network when he negotiated his surrender to US authorities in May 2012 on the Caribbean island of Aruba. Comba might also have provided intelligence that led to the capture of Diego Rastrojo in Venezuela just a month later. There were a wave of arrests of Rastrojos members across Colombia in the aftermath of Comba's surrender. It seems that Diego Rastrojo sought to hold together the Rastrojos even from his prison cell. However, the group was always a loose affiliation of different elements and with the surrender of Comba and the capture of Diego Rastrojo, there was nobody with the profile, or perhaps the interest, to assume a leadership position. Today there are some isolated pockets of Rastrojos, particularly in Narino, in Norte de Santander along the border with Venezuela, in Valle del Cauca and in Cauca. However, the Rastrojos as a national organization are finished. Their rivals, the Urabenos, have not been slow to take advantage of the chaos within Rastrojos ranks. They have not only ""invaded"" the Rastrojos homeland of Valle del Cauca, projecting themselves in the city of Cali and the strategic port of Buenaventura, but have managed to persuade some Rastrojos local commanders to switch sides and become part of the Urabenos' nationwide criminal alliance. With the closure of the Rastrojos criminal chapter, the new one of the Urabenos as Colombia's primary drug trafficking syndicate begins. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"The Challenges for Giulianis Security Strategy in Guatemala. Guatemala's private sector has hired former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani to come up with a security plan to fight crime and violence, which is generating both skepticism and optimism in the Central American country. Guatemala is among the top 30 countries worldwide when it comes to violence containment spending, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace. Guatemala reportedly spends $7.1 billion each year, equal to 8.7 percent of the country's GDP, or $470 for each Guatemalan, placing Guatemala in 28 th place (in terms of a country's violence-containment spending as a percentage of their GDP). This is the second part of an article which originally appeared in Plaza Publica and was translated, edited, and reprinted with permission. See Spanish original here. See part one of InSight Crime's translation here. Government costs correspond to just 1.9 percent of the GDP (0.23 percent distributed to military forces; 1.01 percent to public security; 0.27 percent to the penitentiary system; and 0.48 percent to the justice system). The rest represents industrial sector costs (3 percent) and personal costs (3.5 percent). There are more people working in private security than there are police in Guatemala. According to these statistics, spending on the armed forces and public security (1.24 percent of Guatemala's GDP) is lower than the amount the industrial or business sector spends on private security, which is 1.77 percent. In addition, there are more people working in private security than there are police. An estimate by the Interior Ministry indicates that there are 45,000 registered security guards (in addition to those who are unregistered or who work in illegal businesses), while the PNC has 31,686 police. The current budget of the Interior Ministry is equal to 6.6 percent of the total budget of the federal government. The Ministry of Defense budget is 3 percent. In Latin America, Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico spend more than Guatemala, in relation to their respective GDPs, to contain violence. But Guatemala's homicide rate -- the fourth-highest in Latin America, according to a 2013 UN study -- exceeds that of Colombia and Mexico. In one study, the private sector's economic development think-tank, Fundesa , found that Guatemalan municipalities with the highest levels of economic development have lower rates of poverty, but a larger number of homicides if they lack citizen security strategies. As a result, insecurity limits economic growth. Nevertheless, Emerson Rodriguez, an analyst at the Learning Institute for Sustainable Development (IEPADES), says this is also a question of proportionality, as the more developed municipalities -- which may have higher crime rates -- also have more people living there. Last year, half of Guatemala's homicides were concentrated in six municipalities that have at least 200,000 residents, according to official statistics. These included Guatemala City, Mixco, and Villa Nueva. In addition, the capital of Guatemala, Guatemala City, appears as the seventh most dangerous city in the world, with 68 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, behind cities in Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, and Honduras, according to a 2013 study by the Citizen Council on Public Security and Penal Justice. Reducing Poverty Up until last year, there was an almost parallel reduction in Guatemala's homicide and poverty rate, according to Fundesa. In 2011, the poverty rate reached 53 percent, meaning that one out of every two people in the country was living on $1,200 per year. If this trend should continue, Fundesa estimates that the poverty rate would drop to 45 percent in 2021, and could eventually drop to as low as 35 percent, according to the report. However, Rodriguez believes that less poverty will not necessarily lead to less violence. ""There are departments where there is more poverty and no violence, but analysts continue trying to find a relation between the two,"" he said. div class=""pull-quotes""> ""They can bring ten Giulianis, but it won't work especially if the complex question of the indigenous population is not understood."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Former El Paso Official Sentenced for Drug Smuggling. A former elected official in El Paso, Texas, has been sentenced to six years in federal prison and ordered to pay a fine of $300,000 for drug trafficking, rekindling concerns over the corruption rate among US government officials in the border region. Former El Paso County Commissioner Guillermo ""Willie"" Gandara pled guilty in August to using his property to distribute over 120 pounds of marijuana, reported the El Paso Times. Gandara, reportedly nicknamed ""the Godfather,"" was running for a seat in the Texas House of Representatives prior to his arrest in February 2012 by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). In a recorded conversation with undercover DEA agents, Gandara boasted that his drug smuggling network ran from El Paso to Chicago. Gandara's operation reportedly involved smuggling marijuana hidden in boxes of chilli powder. Gandara's arrest is an important reminder that US officials are not immune to drug-related corruption. Another prominent corruption case from 2011 involved the mayor and police chief of a small town in New Mexico charged with smuggling guns into Mexico. The ex-mayor was sentenced to 51 months in prison earlier this year. US authorities are particularly concerned about the spread of corruption in the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agencies. In August, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which houses both agencies, released a report that detailed several cases in which border security and immigration officers accepted bribes, or participated in drug and gun smuggling schemes. The DHS has blamed the 38 percent rise in complaints against border security officers between 2004 and 2011 on the insufficient vetting of new employees, many of whom were hired during the department's massive post-2004 expansion. Still, many of the most serious criminal violations have involved veteran employees."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Belize Arrest Shows Once-Mighty Guatemala Narco Clan Still Alive. The heir to what was once one of Guatemala's premier drug trafficking organizations has been arrested in Belize, illustrating both the diehard nature of the region's ""transportista"" groups and the role of this often overlooked corner of Central America in the drug trade. Adolfo Eribel Rodriguez Barrientos was arrested in Belize by agents from the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), reported Emisoras Unidas. Following the arrest, police and prosecutors launched a series of raids on properties in Guatemala linked to Rodriguez, who now faces a US extradition order. According to Guatemalan Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla , Rodriguez had taken over drug trafficking operations once run by Jorge Mario Paredes Cordoba, alias ""El Gordo,"" who was arrested in Honduras in 2008 and then extradited to the United States. The Paredes organization was one of the most powerful of Guatemala's so-called transportista clans -- groups hired to move drug shipments. According to the US State department, the group used connections in Colombia, Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico and El Salvador to move multi-ton cocaine shipments into Guatemala. Once in the country, it was either sold in bulk to a third party distributor or moved on to the United States and distributed by contacts there. Paredes, his brothers Ever Omar and Arturo, and his right-hand man Otoniel Turcios Marroquin, alias ""El Loco,"" are all believed to have worked closely with Mexico's Zetas. However, by some accounts, after the arrest of Paredes and the murder of his two brothers, the Zetas turned on Turcios, forcing him out of his territory. However, time and again Guatemala's transportista networks have proven their ability to survive in the face of such setbacks; this latest arrest shows that despite major losses, at least part of the Paredes organization continues to operate today. The arrest is also a reminder of the role Belize plays in the drug trade. While the country is rarely mentioned in discussions on Central American drug trafficking, there is plenty of evidence to suggest its ample coastlines and institutional weaknesses have not gone unnoticed by the region's traffickers. This certainly appears to be the case for the Paredes -- in addition to the recent arrest of Rodriguez, ""El Loco"" Turcios was also arrested in the country in 2010."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"BACRIM Turn to Landmines in Colombia. Colombia's criminal hybrid groups, known as BACRIM, are reportedly using landmines to protect their criminal interests in north Colombia, marking a change in their military tactics that has worrying long-term implications. According to sources in the security forces consulted by El Tiempo , BACRIM (which comes from the Spanish ""bandas criminales,"" or ""criminal bands"") in the provinces of Antioquia and Cordoba have been planting mines to protect coca crops, drug trafficking corridors and illegal mining interests. One of the most affected areas is the region known as the Nudo de Paramillo in northern Antioquia, where landmines have injured six soldiers so far this year. According to the authorities, Colombia's most powerful BACRIM, the Urabenos, are using makeshift mines in their dispute for control of the estimated 1,850 hectares of coca planted in the area's national park. They are not alone. Guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) have also laid landmines in the area. In the Bajo Cauca region, also in Antioquia, communities have also reported that the BACRIM -- along with the FARC and the smaller guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (ELN) -- have been planting mines on paths used by the civilian population. There have been further reports of the BACRIM using mines in the departments of Magdalena and Valle del Cauca. The BACRIM use of landmines makes sense: they are hybrid organizations that need to control territory in order to make money. Their principal function in the cocaine distribution chain is protecting coca crops, processing the coca into cocaine, and securing the cocaine's passage to port for export. They also make money extracting minerals illegally and levying ""protection taxes"" on those that mine legally or illegally. In recent months, numerous BACRIM leaders have been captured or killed pushing some of the lower echelons to drastic measures to maintain their market share. Landmines appear to be part of this strategy. Know how to build mines is embedded in the BACRIM. The paramilitary forerunners of the BACRIM, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), were known to use landmines, although in far few numbers than their guerrilla counterparts. A Landmine Monitor Report, published at the peak of the AUC's power, showed that in 2002, 37 percent of the 638 reported landmine incidents were caused by mines believed to have been planted by the FARC, compared to just 1.2 percent by the AUC. In 44 percent of the cases, it was not known which group was responsible (read full report in pdf form). The use of mines in Colombia is commonly linked to guerrilla groups, especially the FARC , leading some to speculate that there has been a knowledge transfer from the rebels to the BACRIM. Over the course of their half century-long war against the state, the guerrillas have strewn tens of thousands of mines around the country, mainly as a cheap and devastatingly effective way of slowing a military advance. In recent years, the insurgents have also used mines to protect their coca crops , as the Colombian government has moved towards increased manual coca eradication following controversy over the side effects of aerial spraying. Despite the reports of conflict between the rebels and the BACRIM in some of the regions involved, it has become increasingly common for both the FARC and the ELN to forge temporary alliances with their former paramilitary enemies, based around shared criminal interests. In some instances, the guerrillas were reportedly training the BACRIM. Notably, in 2011, police in Bolivar department claimed the FARC were training the Rastrojos how to make landmines. Last year, Colombia recorded its 10,000th landmine victim since 1990, giving it the world's second highest landmine casualty rate after Afghanistan, and many in Colombia have been hoping that a successful peace process with the FARC would enable Colombia to begin the long and arduous process of removing the landmine death traps strewn around the country. However, the revelation of BACRIM use of landmines illustrates the blurring of the lines between the guerrillas and the BACRIM in both tactics and criminal interests, which does not bode well for hopes that a FARC demobilization would bring peace overnight to Colombia."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Nicaragua Releases 8,000 Inmates from Overcrowded Prisons. Nicaragua has reportedly released the equivalent of 80 percent of its prison population over the last two years in a controversial measure to ease overcrowding that suffers from a lack of transparency. On February 22, Nicaraguan government officials announced that 8,149 prisoners had received a conditional release since 2014, 845 of them so far in 2016. As of October 2014, the country's prison population stood at just over 10,500, according to government figures published by the World Prison Brief. According to a Nicaraguan government spokesperson, the prisoners had been sentenced for minor crimes and were serving sentences of less than five years, and their releases were part of a ""humanitarian policy of reconciliation and unity for Nicaraguan families."" The terms of release require the convicts to report periodically to the prison where they were housed, have a family member sign as a guarantor for their release and meet certain conditions such as not entering places where there is gambling or consumption of alcohol, reported El Nuevo Diario. Human rights groups and government opponents criticized the measure for political meddling in the judicial system and for its lack of transparency, especially over the criteria officials used when deciding who receives parole, reported La Prensa. As in much of Central America, Nicaragua's prisons suffer from severe overcrowding, and it is almost certainly this rather than a desire to reconcile families that is behind the mass release of Nicaraguan prisoners. Nicaragua's prison system only has the capacity to hold around 5,000 inmates, and until 2010 the population remained steady at between 6,000 and 7,000, according to the World Prison Brief statistics. However, since then, the population has shot up to over 10,000, leading to appalling conditions in facilities that are crumbling under the strain. Attempting to ease overcrowding by seeking alternatives to custodial sentences may be a viable option under certain circumstances. Flooding prisons with minor criminals can be hugely counter-productive, destroying families, forcing minor offenders to co-exist with hardened criminals, and pushing prison systems to the point of collapse. However, such a policy must be carefully and transparently implemented, otherwise there is the risk is of a situation developing such as in Venezuela -- where over 13,000 prisoners were released onto the streets with a near complete absence of oversight and control. In Nicaragua, lack of government transparency makes it difficult to assess whether the release was a carefully considered response to minimize the impact of a genuine crisis, or a badly planned, knee-jerk reaction to that crisis.

"Female Skeletons Found Near US-Mexico Border Are Reminder of Juarez Femicides. The skeletal remains of 12 people found earlier this year close to Mexico's Ciudad Juarez have been identified as female, bringing attention once more to the city's high rate of murders against women. Mexican authorities announced Monday that six of the 12 victims discovered in January and February in Juarez Valley have been identified as girls between the ages of 15 and 19 years. The girls had been missing since 2009 and 2010, reports the LA Times. The other six have also been identified as female, though their ages are unknown. The cause of death remains unclear, as little more than the bones have been found. Activist leader Victoria Caraveo of the NGO Women of Juarez ( Mujeres de Juarez ) told the Associated Press that the discovery suggests the work of a ""well-organized gang with some people kidnapping them, others mistreating, using or raping them, and others dumping the bodies."" Ciudad Juarez has been afflicted by a high rate of ""femicides"" (gender-based killings of women) over the past two decades. More than 500 cases have been documented since 1993, though the actual number may be far higher. The authorities have generally failed to bring about any prosecutions, and activists protesting the lack of action by Mexico's government have become targets, as evidenced by the rape and murder of campaigner Susana Chavez in January 2011. In November last year, the government was forced into making an apology for the state's failure to prevent the killings, and the continued impunity. The motives behind the murders of women are often unclear, though they are thought to be driven in part by the macho culture linked to the drug trade , and the resulting violence that has engulfed Ciudad Juarez in recent years. What's more, Mexico's criminal gangs have increasingly moved into human trafficking, increasing the levels of violence against women. According to Mexican congresswoman Rosi Orozco, there are some 800,000 cases of sex trafficking in the country each year. Ciudad Juarez's location as a border town and key transit point for people and goods moving north to the US increases the potential for violence associated with these trades. Based on a recent report by the Small Arms Survey entitled "" Femicide: A Global Problem ,"" while Mexico overall has a low rate of femicide compared to others in Central America, with 2.5 cases per 100,000 people between 2004 and 2009, the rate in Ciudad Juarez stood at 19.1 per 100,000 in 2009.

"The Politics Behind Mexico Attorney Generals Resignation. Mexico's Attorney General Arturo Chavez stepped down this week after just a year and a half in office. Most media reports cite his poor performance as the reason for his departure. InSight takes a look at the political calculations behind the move, as well as the struggle faced by his successor in gaining approval for her nomination. Due to the ambiguous nature of the resignation, (Chavez himself has insisted that his resignation was due to ""personal matters that could not be put off"") the Mexican media has been buzzing with speculation about the reasons behind it. El Universal focused on Chavez's own ineptitude , citing several instances where the former official failed to work effectively with other government agencies like the Federal Investigations Agency (Agencia Federal de Investigacion - AFI). Still, others in the country believe that Chavez was fired due to pressure from United States authorities. Leonardo Curzio, a researcher at the Center for Research on North America (CISAN), told El Universal that Chavez likely took the fall after it was revealed that the main suspect in the murder case of the U.S. ICE agent last month was released after initially being jailed in 2009 because the Attorney General's Office did not file proper charges in the case. A series of U.S. diplomatic memos recently released by WikiLeaks, which highlight American ambivalence towards the former attorney general, may lend some weight to these claims. As the Associated Press notes , several cables written by American Embassy officials in the fall of 2009 call Chavez Chavez's initial nomination into question, with one --sent from the recently-departed Ambassador Carlos Pascual-- going so far as to call it ""totally unexpected and politically inexplicable."" In a later cable , another State Department official voices disappointment in Chavez, calling him a ""a less capable political operator"" than his successor. Despite the evidence of American disapproval against Pascual, the final strike against Chavez likely came from domestic politics. When he was called to testify to the Mexican Congress about his knowledge of a U.S. federal operation that allowed American arms stores to sell guns to known criminals in order to trace them, Chavez repeatedly avoided doing so. Although he released a statement denying government knowledge of the program, his repeated refusal to testify led to speculation that he was hiding information. After accepting Chavez's resignation, President Felipe Calderon nominated Marisela Morales, head of the much-lauded organized crime unit of the federal prosecutor's office. While she still awaits confirmation by the Mexican Senate, Marisela Morales already has one vote -- that of their U.S. counterparts. According to Mexico's La Vanguardia , Morales was included on a short list of ideal replacements suggested by American officials, and has expressed deep respect for the United States' role in assisting Mexico's drug war. Though it is too early to tell, this endorsement may work against her during the Senate hearing process. As evidenced by the recent outcry against secret U.S. drone flights in the country, Mexicans largely disapprove of perceived foreign military intervention in their territory. If Morales voices too much support for American anti-drug efforts, she could risk losing public opinion in this strongly nationalistic country. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Shooting Highlights Mexico City Airport as Hub for Drug Trade. The investigation into a shootout between different groups of Federal Police in Mexico City's international airport last month has not resulted in the arrests of the suspected killers, but it offers further indication of the airport's importance for criminal groups. The airport in Mexico's capital city earned a wave of new headlines on June 25, when two Federal Police officers are believed to have shot three of their colleagues to death. The two alleged shooters are Daniel Cruz Garcia and Zeferino Morales Franco, who disappeared following the incident and remain at large. A third agent who was reportedly acting as an accomplice, shift leader Bogard Lugo de Leon, also fled following the shooting. According to a Federal Police spokesman , the pair of alleged shooters were participants in a smuggling ring that was bringing cocaine into Mexico on a flight from Peru that arrived the morning of June 25. When they were confronted by the three agents who had been investigating the ring for a year and a half, Morales Franco (who was carrying the drugs which had just arrived in the country) and Cruz Garcia opened fire. The incident comes ahead of a period of significant transition for the Department of Public Security (or SSP, for its initials in Spanish), the cabinet agency which houses the Federal Police. Genaro Garcia Luna, the controversial secretary who has emerged as one of the figures with the greatest amount of influence on security policy in the Calderon administration, will almost certainly be leaving the post in December, as President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto brings in his own team upon taking over. Pena Nieto has promised to increase the role of the Federal Police in order to reduce the role of the armed forces, although it remains to be seen if the SSP emerges as a locus of security policy the same way it was under Calderon. While the group of officers was linked to a smuggling group run by a figure known only as El Chino, subsequent reports from the government indicated that the Sinaloa Cartel currently controls the Mexico City airport. The organization, often described as Mexico's most powerful criminal network, is headed by Joaquin "" El Chapo "" Guzman and Ismael "" El Mayo "" Zambada, with men loyal to Zambada controlling the cocaine shipments that arrive at the airport. Over the years, the Sinaloa Cartel has exercised intermittent control over the air traffic passing through Mexico City. For most of the past decade, the Beltran Leyva Organization , or BLO, dominated the airport, which essentially gave Guzman and his group unfettered use of the facility. However, the 2008 split between Beltran Leyva brothers and the Sinaloa bosses eliminated this easy access, and threw control of one of the nation's most important transport hubs into flux. After the 2009 death of Arturo Beltran Leyva in a shootout with Mexican marines, control of the airport devolved to his erstwhile subordinate, Edgar Valdez Villarreal. Valdez was subsequently arrested in August 2010, which cleared the way for Zambada and his partners to take over. The amount of passenger and cargo traffic passing through the airport, which lies in the geographical center of the country and serves as a hub for both international and domestic flights, helps explain its appeal to criminal groups. With almost 28 million passengers and 409,000 tons of cargo arriving per year , Mexico's busiest airport offers a wealth of legitimate traffic which helps mask the illicit shipments of cocaine and methamphetamine precursor chemicals. While Mexico City has long been the prize possession, criminal groups have also sought access to other airports. For years, the BLO also maintained control of the Cancun airport , which is second only to Mexico City's in terms of passenger traffic, and lies just a short flight across the Caribbean from Colombia and Venezuela. Even before the most recent shootout, evidence of drug traffickers exploiting airport facilities and their employees frequently emerged in recent years. Three employees of Aeromexico were arrested in Madrid in 2010, after smuggling 135 kilos of cocaine out of a flight leaving from Mexico City, and months later, pilot from the same airline was arrested in Madrid with roughly 40 kilos of cocaine. And while its relevance to the actual movement of drug shipments is indirect, one of the most infamous crimes in recent Mexican history took place at the Guadalajara airport, another of Mexico's biggest: a hit team searching for Guzman, sent by the Arellano Felix brothers in 1993, confused their target's vehicle with the limousine of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, and riddled it with bullets. Guzman escaped the attempt on his life, but Posadas Ocampo and six others were murdered. "	1	1	0	1	0	0	0
"Is Bogotas Gun Ban Responsible for a Drop in Homicides?The city of Bogota has seen a significant reduction in homicides after passing a ban on carrying guns. If the two developments prove to be related, the ban could provide a model to other violence-plagued cities in the region. On February 1, newly-elected Bogota mayor Gustavo Petro introduced a three-month ban on carrying guns in public, saying that to carry a weapon represented ""not a defense mechanism, but a risk."" On April 30, Petro declared that the ban had been a success, and had contributed to a 31 percent drop in homicides when compared to the first four months of 2011. April in particular saw a particularly large drop in homicides, and with only 96 murders reported, was the most peaceful April on record in 15 years. Because of this, Petro and local army officials (the military is responsible for gun regulation in the country) announced that the ban would be extended for three more months. If the ban continues to see success, it may prove permanent. Petro has expressed interest in this, and saying that he wants to change the attitude of Colombians towards weapons, in order to ""generate a culture of tolerance and love."" At first glance, the gun ban and corresponding drop in homicides seems to provide a compelling model for cities elsewhere in the region. As a report recently published by the Inter-American Dialogue noted, most of Latin America's homicides are concentrated in urban areas. Indeed, access to weapons has been cited by some commentators -- including InSight Crime -- as one of the main drivers of violence in Caracas, especially among poor youths in the city's slums. If restricting the bearing of firearms had so much success in Bogota, why not export it to other violent hotspots in the hemisphere, like Caracas, Rio de Janeiro, or San Pedro Sula? The fact is, however, that there are a number of other factors that could have played into the city's reduction in homicides. Bogota was the first site of a new national urban security initiative launched last year, known as ""Plan Cuadrantes,"" which was designed to divide cities into as many as several hundred sectors, each manned by a police base. According to National Police officials, Plan Cuadrantes encourages ties to the community by focusing efforts on block-by-block policing. While acknowledging the impact of the gun ban, Bogota police credit the implementation of Plan Cuadrantes with lowering crime in the capital city. Another factor which likely played into the reduction in violence were the June 2011 changes made to Bogota's liquor laws under the previous acting mayor, Clara Lopez Obregon. The new code made it illegal to sell alcoholic beverages in liquor stores, grocery stores, and corner shops after 11:00 p.m., and banned the public consumption of alcohol after that time. The move is believed to have cut down on violent confrontations, as around 90 percent of reported conflicts registered in 2010 involved some degree of alcohol use. In addition to these other explanations, it is simply too early to call the gun ban a success. A 31 percent drop over four months, after all, is hardly conclusive evidence that the policy has made an impact on violence in Bogota. Homicide rates are also falling in Colombia's other major cities of Medellin and Cali , suggesting that this may be a nationwide trend, possibly related to the country's long-term decline in unemployment. Because Petro himself is a former guerrilla who laid down his weapons to participate in conventional politics, the gun ban is an attractive narrative, but there is simply not enough hard evidence to back his assertion that it has made an impact on violence. Indeed, attempts to concretely link the availability of weapons with homicide rates elsewhere in Latin America have proved to be problematic , meaning that at the very least a degree of skepticism is necessary before hailing Bogota's gun ban as a policy model for reining in security in the region.

ELN Suspects in Colombia Massacre. An armed group killed eight villagers and wounded four others in a weekend raid on a bar in the southern department of Narino, Colombian authorities announced. According to reports , a gang of at least 12 armed men entered the establishment in the village of Villanueva, located not far from the Ecuadorian border, a few minutes before midnight on Saturday and, without a word of warning, opened fire on the patrons. The four wounded patrons were taken to the department capital for treatment. The motive for the attack is still unknown, but authorities are investigating whether rebels from the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) or drug traffickers are responsible. Villanueva does not have a history of massacres, authorities said, but well armed criminal groups are known to operate in the vicinity. The ELN , an insurgent group that had faded from the prominence in recent years, has returned to the national scene in part because of its embrace of drug trafficking , which it had previously avoided. As was the case in the early 1980s with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ), with whom the ELN has a budding alliance, the influx of revenue from drug sales has allowed the group to replenish its ranks. 	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Money Laundering Investigation Links Argentina Developers with Colombia Narcos. Authorities in Argentina have frozen $100 million in assets belonging to a major property developer, in a money laundering case linked to Colombian drug lords that highlights the country's role in the financial side of the transnational drug trade. The investigation by the Financial Information Unit (UIF) and the Federal Administration of Public Revenue (AFIP) -- which began in 2011 -- is looking into 20 property trusts and the investment of over $200 million into urban developments in the luxury gated community of Nordelta in north Argentina. Of the 250 investors being investigated in the case, 70 percent failed to prove the origins of their money, reported Pagina/12. The investigation is focused on the director of property developer Oda Constructora, architect Walter Mosca, who is suspected of using his business to launder drug money for the relatives of alleged traffickers with operations in the area, including Colombian nationals Jesus Antonio Yepes Gaviria and Ignacio Alvarez Meyendorff. Meyendorff is believed to have been a member of Colombia's defunct Norte del Valle Cartel, and was arrested in Buenos Aires in April 2011 and accused of being the top financial chief of a drug trafficking network that included the now incarcerated Colombian drug lords Luis Agustin Caicedo Velandia, alias ""Don Lucho,"" and Daniel ""El Loco"" Barrera. The former wife of Barrera, Ruth Martinez is also implicated in the case and was detained in Argentina in 2012 on charges of laundering money through a real estate company she had set up. In June, Colombian authorities seized hundreds of millions of dollars of assets linked to Alvarez Meyendorff and his brother. Argentina has long been a popular hideout and meeting place for Colombian drug traffickers, not only for the network run by Meyendorff and Don Lucho, but also for traffickers linked to Medellin's Oficina de Envigado and Colombia's premier criminal operation, the Urabenos -- whose leading cocaine broker Henry de Jesus Lopez, alias ""Mi Sangre,"" was arrested in the country in 2012. It is little surprise such traffickers would also use the country to set up money laundering operations, not only for convenience, but also because the country's boom and bust economy has created ideal conditions for financial crimes, according to the US State Department ; there is a widespread use of cash, blackmarket currency transfers, a history of capital flight, and the practice of holding savings in US dollars is common. Money laundering and financial crime scandals in the country have not only involved Colombian traffickers but also major financial institutions , soccer clubs and even close allies of current President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and her husband and predecessor Nestor Kirchner."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"What Mexicos Elections Mean for Crime Policy: Part II. Though power is set to change hands in Mexico's impending presidential election, a radical shift in the country's security policy is unlikely. InSight Crime looks at the factors preventing change, in the second of a two-part series. The Limits of Reform Some have said that a Pena Nieto presidency would mean a major shift in the country's security policy, but this is overstated. It seems to stem from the idea that Pena Nieto, whose Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) is often blamed for the flourishing of Mexico's transnational criminal groups in the 1980s and 1990s, will seek a pact with the drug traffickers, allowing them carte blanche in exchange for millions of dollars in bribes and a fall in violence. While such a move would not be unthinkable, Pena Nieto has said on numerous occasions that he will continue to attack Mexico's criminal organizations. Even if he were inclined to negotiate, a number of factors make a return to the 1980s impossible: the fracturing of the trafficking industry (there are no longer one or two dominant organizations to make deals with), the democratic opening (even holding the presidency, the PRI will not have a monopoly on power), the more aggressive and more open investigative news media, and an endless stream of public opinion polls finding widespread support for an aggressive posture toward criminal groups. Other elements of Pena Nieto's supposed change of direction are less dramatic than they might appear. As noted in part I , his focus on reducing violence reflects a society-wide clamor, rather than the candidate's radical new crime policies. Calderon has also hailed recent drops in violence. Were he to serve a second term (which is banned under Mexico's constitution), he would likely place greater emphasis on lowering the murder rate as well. Other concerns are simply unfounded. One is that a Pena Nieto administration would drastically reduce cooperation with the US. There is no good reason to expect this. Giving Washington the cold shoulder after the election would be inconsistent with Pena Nieto's campaign, during which he has been highly solicitous of US opinion (hence his interview with the New York Times, and numerous public appearances in the country). Furthermore, there are countless points of contact between the two governments independent of the presidency, and the next leader wouldn't be able to simply shut all these down, even if he were interested in doing so. Moreover, a certain level of cooperation with US officials is popular in Mexico; according to a recent poll from the Pew Research Center , 75 percent of the population are in favor of the US providing military and police training to their Mexican counterparts. In fact, relations between the White House and the Mexican presidency may well improve with Calderon's exit. While the Harvard-educated Calderon is often painted as pro-US, he has become a strident critic of his northern neighbor in recent years. He has slammed the US for failing to crack down on the southbound flow of arms and the demand for illegal drugs, and has even suggested that druglord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman is hiding north of the border. His fury at former US Ambassador Carlos Pascual's criticism of Mexico's military, revealed in a WikiLeaks cable, obliged Pascual to tender his resignation in 2011. Another area worrying some policymakers is the possibility that Pena Nieto would remove the armed forces from Mexico's streets. In fact, Pena Nieto, like his electoral adversaries, has called for the gradual removal of military troops, but, crucially, he has not said when he would do this, nor has he staked his reputation on it. His position on the matter is more aspirational than operational, and should he continue to use the military in a domestic capacity throughout his presidency, it wouldn't qualify as a broken promise so much as a vague goal that went unmet. What to Expect In short, Mexico's crime policy has certain foundations that a Pena Nieto presidency would not shake. At the most fundamental level, there will likely continue to be widespread prohibition of the same drugs that are currently illegal, both in the US and in Mexico. The two countries will certainly continue to cooperate. Arrests of capos will still represent a public relations coup for the Mexican security agencies, as well as the presidency, and so will still be pursued. Efforts to strengthen the institutions charged with implementing security policy, including ongoing purges of corrupt officials, will remain a vital imperative for any government, and Pena Nieto has indicated that such efforts will continue. Any shifts will occur within the relatively narrow terrain left untouched by these boundaries. After the campaign, the lasting impression has not been that of a runaway favorite intent on making radical changes to the fight against organized crime. Rather, it has been of a quartet of candidates who seem well aware of the fact that there is no easy answer to Mexico's security problems. Their response has been to largely ignore the issue. InSight Crime noted the candidates' lack of interest in crime policy in January, and the subsequent six months of campaigning did little to change that. The candidates' comments on the stump have been noticeably short on details on security. The three presidential debates -- two official ones in which Pena Nieto participated, one organized by the anti-PRI campaign group Yo Soy 132, in which he did not -- have devoted precious little attention to security policy. Public security remains one of the most important questions for Mexican voters, but the fact that no one, including the front runner, wants to stake their candidacy on it demonstrates the lack of concrete ideas for how to improve the situation. For a number of reasons, the organized crime issue is a pickle for policy-makers: broadly speaking, Calderon's policies are popular, but their results -- more than 50,000 deaths over the past six years, and a doubling of the murder rate -- have been disastrous. Worse still, the links between Calderon's strategy and the increased bloodshed are indirect and unclear. That is, radical changes to Calderon's approach carry a definite political risk, but there is no certainty that they would bring about lower murder rates. Consequently, the Calderon administration's approach will likely continue to feature over the next six years. Should he win, Pena Nieto will surely seek some cosmetic changes, and he may push the philosophy underlying Mexico's crime strategy in a new direction. But the obstacles to a different approach are enormous; as a result, for better or worse, the shifts are likely to be marginal. The impact this has on crime rates and the quality of Mexico's institutions remains to be seen. Read part I of InSight Crime's series on the Mexican presidential election. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Did US Tip Off Panama About North Korean Missile Find?Panamanian authorities have discovered weapons and ""sophisticated missile equipment"" on a ship traveling from Cuba to North Korea along the Panama Canal, raising the question of who tipped off the raid. President Ricardo Martinelli said the undeclared cargo appeared to include missile equipment and non-conventional arms and was hidden beneath containers of sugar, reported the Associated Press. Authorities had been tipped off a few days ago that the ship might be carrying drugs, he said. Only one of the ship's five cargo holds had been searched at the time of reporting. ""We're going to keep unloading the ship and figure out exactly what was inside,"" said the president on Panamanian television, reported Reuters. ""You cannot go around shipping undeclared weapons of war through the Panama Canal."" Hugh Griffiths, an arms trafficking expert at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, told the AP that the seized ship had been caught trafficking drugs and small arms ammunition in the past. Martinelli posted a poor quality photo of the seizure on his Twitter feed. Panama is a major transshipment point for Colombian cocaine and an international money laundering haven, yet very few of thousands of ships passing along the Panama Canal every year are searched. The canal, a key international trade asset, is the lifeblood of Panama's economy and to conduct regular searches would be extremely bad for business. A timely tip-off clearly resulted in this recent arms seizure. Given that the parties involved in the wrongdoing were Cuba and North Korea, it's worth speculating whether the United States provided the intelligence. It is also worth considering just how many other weapons, drug shipments, and contraband items may be moving along the canal undetected -- is the canal a hub for international crime as well as trade?"	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Reporting from Ilopango: El Salvadors First Peace Zone. El Faro tells the story of Ilopango's first month as a ""violence-free"" municipality, after it was named as the first ""peace zone"" to be launched as part of El Salvador's gang truce. Ilopango -- one of 14 municipalities that compose the metropolitan area of San Salvador, and historically one of the most violent -- was chosen as the first area for the implementation of peace zones. The zones are part of the second phase of the country's gang truce, negotiated between the government and the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 gangs. In January , Ilopango's gangs agreed to hand in their weapons and cease all forms of criminal activity. However, the area's first months as a designated ""violence-free"" zone have been rocky. A spate of murders in February , three of which took place in Ilopango, raised concerns over the long-term prospects of the truce, though Justice and Security Minister David Munguia Payes denied that these killings undermined either the truce or the idea of peace zones. In this context, El Faro interviewed members of both gangs in Ilopango to paint a picture of the trials and achievements of the process thus far. The following is InSight Crime's translation of selected extracts of the article, with permission from El Faro. The full text in Spanish can be read at El Faro. What happened in Ilopango during its first month as a ""violence-free"" municipality? Beyond the cold numbers, which show an undeniable decrease in homicides, Ilopango has gangs faced with the problem of trying to reinvent themselves and at the same time preserve their essence, and a community long repressed by gang brutality wanting to believe in the only hope that has come in years: the truce. This is the story of the first sanctuary municipality and of its struggle to believe its own promises. *** They [the MS-13] are about to inaugurate a new chicken farm the gang members themselves have constructed it with their own hands: they've sawed, hammered, cut, nailed every piece of this farm. Marvin [MS-13's spokesman in Ilopango] hopes that this farm will sustain at least 20 gang members and their families. But he doesn't say so with great contentment. In Ilopango alone there are 14 cliques and the smallest is the Guanacos Locos, which has 20 members. His own cell has 45 active ""homeboys."" ""But it's not just that, we alone have about 30 homeboys in prison, and we can't let them be lost, so that there alone would be 75 people, and you have to put that many for each clique around here. We have more than 37 dead, and we have to provide for their families. Marvin estimates that the size of the problem is at least 500 people. ""And that is only us, from the MS-13. How do you see the problem? It's a big one, right?"" *** The written records of the agreement between the municipal government and the gang members show a change in word choice: they will no longer be called gang members, but rather, ""at-risk youth."" Marvin's turn [in the inauguration ceremony] arrived ""We are the youth that are at risk in the municipality of Ilopango. We are anxious to work; if you give us a shovel we'll do it, if you give us a hammer we'll do it. Now we are seeing the fruits of our labor."" The final moment arrived: Mayor Salvador Ruano's turn When he raised his gaze from the floor, his voice was a shout: ""I'm making a call to the central government that instead of spending huge quantities of money on publicity they come and give us a few thousand dollars!"" *** Edwin is Marvin's equivalent in Barrio 18 from his house emerges the welcome odor of recently baked bread. This bakery of the ""Tiny Locos"" clique was the first reconciliation project between the municipal government and the town's gang members. In fact, according to Mayor Ruano, it was in one of the streets of this neighborhood where a Barrio 18 member, his face completely tattooed, surprised him as he was going door to door asking for residents' votes during his campaign: ""Hey Ruano, if you win, is it possible that we could talk?"" Edwin explains to me how things have changed, as he strokes the hair of his little girl, who has scraped her knees playing in the street. He insists that they have suspended all types of extortion of the neighbors with small businesses and that in order to become part of the gang now you are no longer required to kill, like you had to until recently, when he was an aspiring gang member. *** This [the place where a public event is being held] is MS-13 territory: The municipal government offices, the central park, the school and its surroundings are considered part of the domain which the mara acquired by force. That's why they have kept the park, in full view of everyone, next to the inflatable pools, while a corner next to the stage has been reserved for the guests of Barrio 18. The politicians said hello and congratulated each other. There was a minister with his assistant minister, police chiefs, pastors, priests, prayers and they freed white doves and Marvin offered a speech on behalf of the Mara: ""We promise before Ilopango to return peace to this municipality"". Later Edwin, representing Barrio 18, said: ""There will no longer be any bloodshed"". And people applauded. *** Today there is a parents' meeting in the Colonia Las Canas school [located in a long-time dangerous neighborhood controlled by and divided between the MS-13 and Barrio 18], where they will discuss the important point of student security the majority have come to hear the promises of MS-13 and Barrio 18. Last year, when the municipal government formalized discussions with the gangs, it was the Las Canas cliques who were the first to attend. Both agreed to a truce of complete non-aggression and, in addition, Barrio 18 agreed to clean up and improve their territory. Mayor Ruano signed, the head of the municipal government signed and the police chief signed. The gang members wrote and signed their names, and in the part of the document reserved for the official post held, they wrote MS or 18. *** On the afternoon of February 12, ""Godo"" left to sell avocadoes on foot, accompanied by his friend. It was his second trip that day. In the morning he worked selling bread for the San Bartolo bakery. He was an active member of Barrio 18. In the afternoon he sold avocadoes from a cart. His real name was Kevin Antonio Lemus Paz. Several days earlier he had turned 18. Five guys came across his path and didn't give him time to react. They left 14 bullet holes in his body. Experts could not agree on whether there were 8 or 11 gunshot wounds. The avocadoes lay strewn on the ground several meters from his body. The boy with him said that Godo couldn't even run. The police arrested two people in the act. At least one had M and the S tattooed on his body. *** Following Godo's death, the Barrio 18's phones exploded, and there were those who spoke of treason The MS-13 members only managed to explain that this was not an official order from the gang and that those responsible would have to answer to others, whose names were not mentioned. One week after Godo's murder, the first meeting of the two gangs took place in the municipal council's meeting room. The Mara asked everyone ""to be serious and recognize that there are problems,"" but said that that despite this, the process must continue. They also said that when a Barrio 18 member entered their territory, they would capture him, but would turn him over alive to their enemies, and said that they hoped the other side would do the same. Following that occasion, they agreed that all future meetings would be held with both gangs present, and it has been that way since. *** On February 11, the bloody corpse of an anonymous man appeared. It appeared that he had been kidnapped in another zone and forced to walk, tied up, to one of the most miserable and ungoverned parts of Ilopango, the San Mauricio neighborhood. All of the clues indicate that he was brutally beaten, and that they later attempted to hang him from a structure that couldn't support his weight. The murderers pulled up some cement tubing holding filthy water and used it to smash in his head. In connection with the murder, police are looking for two suspects from the MS, known only as Fredy and Alex. *** Perhaps so that we can see them, or maybe because they don't care at all if we see them, the gang members that control this place [members of the Hollywood Gangsters clique of Barrio 18] pass a pistol from hand to hand and smoke marijuana constantly They buy a liter of beer in the store and share sips. They listen to music on their cell phones They make phone calls in order to monitor the police presence, activate their alarms when a car enters that from a distance appears unfamiliar, receive other ""homeboys"" who come to this space looking for marijuana, tell jokes, talk about the stories behind their tattoes, spit, and nod off under the effect of that strong and relaxing smoke.

"Venezuela Hides its Cocaine Behind Marijuana Seizures. Venezuela's anti-narcotics agency reported that marijuana made up 80 percent of its drug seizures in the first half of 2019, contradicting international reports that point to cocaine as the drug most trafficked out of Venezuela. The director of the National Anti-Drugs Office (Oficina Nacional Antidrogas - ONA), Alberto Matheus, revealed the tendency during a presentation of the 2019-2025 National Anti-Drug Plan. But the figures don't seem to line up. InSight Crime accessed ONA's official 2017 report in which the same authorities reported that marijuana made up 14.24 percent of total drug seizures, while cocaine made up 85.67 percent. The official report for 2018's seizures was not released. Graphic from an official report by Venezuela's National Anti-Drugs Office (ONA) During the presentation, Matheus did not offer any further details about the seizures, but made it clear that the government emphatically opposes ""any legalization of drugs that destroy the human race."" The lack of transparency and information on the part of the Venezuelan government regarding drug seizures, consumption and trafficking, raises doubts about the veracity of the information presented. There are no recent management reports published on ONA's official page. The data for marijuana seizures taking place in 2019 so far is not backed up by any public documents. Also not provided, are the locations and characteristics of seizures, such as the number of tons of the other drugs included in the total quantity seized. Venezuela's former anti-drugs tsar, Mildred Camero, told InSight Crime that it is very probable that authorities ""are modifying the statistics to evade responsibility for the true reality of drug trafficking - specifically of cocaine - within Venezuelan territory."" According to Camero, it is contradictory that the drug most seized abroad is cocaine, which is also historically the drug most trafficked out of Venezuela, but that marijuana now accounts for such a vast majority of seizures. ""This means only two things: that there is a failure at police checkpoints or that there is complicity on the part of officials so that cocaine shipments go undetected,"" says Camero. At the end of 2018, Transparency Venezuela presented its first CRIMJUST Project report, a joint initiative between the United Nations Office Against Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Interpol and Transparency International, in which they evaluated nine countries located along cocaine trafficking routes in Latin America, the Caribbean and West Africa. Venezuela had the poorest results as the report found that although laws do exist against corruption and organized crime, they are not put into practice. The General-Coordinator for the Free Chair on Anti-Drugs Matters (Catedra Libre Antidroga - CLIAD), Hernan Matute Brouzes, agreed that Venezuela is covering up and disguising cocaine trafficking in the country. ""This is a deceitful statistic that they are using to mislead,"" he added. ""They hide [the cocaine trafficking] because this is an outlaw state that is involved in distinct illicit activities that other countries have been sanctioned for."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Rio de Janeiro Militias Muscle in on Brazil Elections. Not only have Rio de Janeiro's violent militia groups dramatically expanded -- growing from just six communities in 2004 to 148 today -- they have also made their presence felt in the lead-up to this Sunday's election. In September, Rio de Janeiro's Secretary of Public Security (SSP) released something of a bombshell for Brazil crime analysts : the city's infamous militia groups have expanded dramatically over the past decade. According to the SSP, since 2004 the number of Rio communities in which these groups operate has grown from just six favelas to 148 today. Authorities also believe that the phenomenon has spread beyond the city, with militias controlling 195 communities in 23 of the 90 municipalities in Rio de Janeiro state. The trend has become even more relevant during Brazil's general election season. As journalist Marsilea Gombata wrote in a recent piece for news magazine CartaCapital , there is overwhelming evidence that militias are a political force in Rio. In 2006 to 2008, considered the heyday of militia activity in the city, politicians like then-mayor Cesar Maia openly supported militias as community ""self-defense"" initiatives. The most well-known militia group in Rio, the ""Justice League,"" even managed to get its leaders -- the brothers Joao Guimaraes Filho and Natalino Jose Guimaraes -- elected to city council and the state legislature in 2008, respectively, although they were subsequently arrested on murder charges. While experts say the militias can no longer operate as openly, they still exert influence over the neighborhoods they control. On top of controlling housing projects and forcing favela residents to pay for ""security"" and services like gas and electricity at inflated prices, the militias stand to make a windfall off of ""selling"" their community's vote to the highest bidders. In exchange for payment, militias intimidate locals into voting for their favored candidate, prohibiting rivals from campaigning there. In August, authorities identified 41 areas throughout Rio de Janeiro state where candidates have been intimidated against campaigning for office by criminal groups, though just 16 were specifically tied to militias, as O Globo reported. On Sunday, just as President Dilma Rousseff is facing a runoff against Aecio Neves, voters in Rio state will choose between current Governor Luiz Fernando de Souza -- better known locally as ""Pezao"" -- and his challenger, evangelical Bishop Marcelo Crivella. While there's little difference between their positions on crime policy, the last few months saw Pezao trade barbs with other gubernatorial candidates regarding ties to Rio de Janeiro militias. In a September 2 debate, for instance, Pezao came under fire from former Governor Anthony Garotinho for alleged links to illegal militia groups in western Rio de Janeiro. In response, the governor openly shot back at Garotinho, saying that his rival was the one with ""notorious"" connections to the militia groups. The two continued to exchange similar accusations in following debates, as Noticias R7 noted. But despite all the attention drawn to militia groups thanks to this year's political campaigning, there's been little discussion of the best way to dismantle them once and for all. It is true that police recently conducted a series of arrests meant to stop Justice League operations in a western Rio de Janeiro suburb, Campo Grande. Yet the Justice League has already proven that it's more than capable of continuing its operations, even with its main leadership behind bars: the militia's leaders have been in custody for over five year now. It will take more than jailing its leadership to bring down groups like the Justice League. According to Dr. Ignacio Cano, director of the Rio de Janeiro state university's (UERJ) Laboratory of Violence Analysis, resolving Rio's militia problem is made more difficult by the state's current emphasis on ""pacifying"" favelas controlled by drug traffickers and street gangs. While presenting his research last month (see Rio on Watch's helpful write-up ), Cano lamented the fact that ""there are no strategies in place to combat the militias and take back those areas"" under militia control. Another complication is the make-up of the militias themselves: as networks of off-duty and former security forces, their members occasionally overlap with military police. This means intelligence leaks are a constant risk, making it difficult for investigators to launch surprise operations. And considering how difficult it is to hold Rio police accountable for abuses like extrajudicial executions and disappearances, what some have called a culture of enabling police brutality could also extend to militia members as well, complicating efforts to prosecute them. In any case, the fact is that Rio's militias are poised to continue their expansion virtually unhindered. The latest polls suggest that Pezao enjoys a 12-point lead over his rival in the governor's race. If he wins, there's little chance he will shake up the current security strategy. While he has promised to establish several new UPPs in the city's surrounding Baixada Fluminense region and the neighboring city of Niteroi, Pezao has said nothing about a new strategy to fight the spread of militias. Meanwhile, the SSP's revised estimate on militia control is just the latest alarming indication that the groups have extended beyond their traditional strongholds in the city's North and West Zones. In fact, some analysts believe the militias control far more than the SSP acknowledges. In December 2013, UERJ urban anthropologist Alba Zaluar and Oswaldo Cruz Foundation researcher Christovam Barcellos released a study suggesting that militias control 454 of the roughly 1,000 favelas located in the city of Rio de Janeiro. This amounts to 45 percent, compared to 37 percent (370 communities) in the run by drug trafficking gangs, leaving just 18 percent (174) effectively under control of the military police and the UPPs."	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
"Ecuador Officials Reject Report Saying Mexico Cartels Operate There. Law enforcement officials in Ecuador rejected a recent report indicating that Mexican cartels have a presence there, in what is likely an attempt to preserve the country's image as a relatively safe nation, despite mounting evidence that the booming cocaine trade is fueling organized crime across the Andean region. Ecuador National Police official Edwin Noguera rejected the idea that Mexican organized crime groups have an operational presence in the South American country in comments reported by El Universo on November 14. ""You cannot speak of Mexican cartels in Ecuador,"" Noguera said. The police official acknowledged that transnational drug trafficking groups have been identified as having a presence in the country in the past, but he implied that these groups do not engage in drug trafficking from Ecuador. Rather, he said, they come to Ecuador simply to launder money earned from illicit activities. Noguera's comments come days after media accounts citing a report from Mexico's Attorney General's Office (Procuraduria General de la Republica - PGR) asserted that four Mexican cartels -- the Sinaloa Cartel, Zetas, Familia Michoacana and Gulf Cartel -- have a presence in Ecuador as well as Colombia, Peru, the United States, China and other countries. The decision by Ecuadorean anti-narcotics officials to reject the notion that Mexican cartels have a presence in the country is likely an attempt to preserve Ecuador's largely positive reputation when it comes to security. The Andean nation has for years boasted some of Latin America's lowest homicide rates. However, there is strong evidence that Mexican crime groups are in fact engaged in drug trafficking activities in Ecuador, which has seen indications of an uptick in cocaine trafficking recently. While the drug trade through Ecuador has historically been controlled by Colombian organized crime groups, Mexican cartels have been noted as having a presence in the country since as far back as 2012. In 2013, Ecuador's vice-minister for internal security at the time acknowledged the presence of Mexican criminal groups in the country. While conducting field research in Colombia's southwestern departments of Narino and Putumayo, both of which share a border with Ecuador, InSight Crime found that much of the cocaine departing Colombia first stops in Ecuador before continuing on to Central America and eventually the United States. Given that Mexican cartels largely oversee the movement of that cocaine from South America through Central America and on to US markets, their presence in Ecuador would come as no surprise."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Mapping Brazils Homicides at the Micro Level. A spatial analysis of homicides across Brazil shows intense clusters of violence around the country's smaller cities and in rural areas, offering an insight into the importance of social factors as well as organized crime in driving violence in these regions. An October 2014 report by the Latin America Initiative of the Brookings Institution looked at six types of murder in Brazil, based on municipal statistics for 2011: aggregate homicides (see map), homicides of men, homicides of women, youth homicides, non-white homicides, and gun-related homicides. By mapping out ""hot"" and ""cool"" spots for violence, the authors found that across the board, the most significant clusters of high homicide rates were seen in the northeastern states of Paraiba, Bahia and Alagoas, particularly around Paraiba state capital Joao Pessoa. Alegoas' capital, Maceio, was also a violence hot spot for several of the homicide categories. In various other spots along Brazil's Atlantic Coast, as well as the central state of Para and the western state of Rondonia, large ""red spots"" also appeared for all categories. For three categories -- aggregate homicides, men only, and non-white only -- significant parts of Mato Grosso state, located between Para and Rondonia, were also hotbeds of violence. For female homicides, fewer regions in the states identified above were found to be ""hot"" (see map), but an additional cluster of violence was seen in northwest Amazonas state, on the border with Colombia. A small spot around the city of Rio de Janeiro saw extremely high rates of homicides for all categories except femicide, but this pattern was not repeated around Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo. The report's authors conducted regression analyses to test the relationship between certain social factors -- such as poverty, illiteracy, unemployment and large-scale development programs -- and violence in the regions of concern. Some of the findings were predictable: social marginalization and single-mother households were associated with high homicide rates, while the social welfare program Bolsa Familia was associated with lower rates. Other results were less intuitive: higher male employment and better state capacity were also associated with violence. To explain this, the researchers suggested that increased employment can create more targets for crime, and that states may invest more resources in high-crime areas. The study also found that development projects with a high environmental impact were linked to violence against women, and posited that this could be because the influx of temporary workers for these projects produces a rise in prostitution. The authors also noted that the area along the Colombian border is a problematic region for sex trafficking. Based on the findings, the authors recommended prioritizing policies addressing marginalization, as well as further studies looking specifically at how investment to reduce marginalization can impact violence. They also discuss the importance of developing policies that target whole geographic areas -- rather than just certain communities -- tailored to the unique problems affecting populations in these areas. The Brookings Institution's report focuses largely on the role of social factors in driving up homicide rates, but it is also worth considering the part that criminal groups play in this violence. Many of the states highlighted as violence hotspots in the report have a significant presence of powerful criminal actors. For example, according to Brazilian police , the First Capital Command (PCC) gang now controls drug routes that pass through Rondonia and Mato Grosso -- both of which have high concentrations of violence. Northeast Brazil has experienced an uptick in crack cocaine consumption, as the market has spread from the major urban centers down south. As of 2012, the region was reportedly home to 40 percent of the country's users of crack and other cocaine derivatives. The region is historically poor and under-resourced, but has experienced an economic boom in recent years. According to officials consulted by the New York Times , including Bahia's governor, the influx of money has fomented drug trafficking and associated crime. This could help explain the Brookings Institution's finding that higher employment is associated with higher violence. Para state, which is covered in ""hot"" areas in the report, is a center of illegal logging and related land conflicts. More than half of deaths from such conflicts in Brazil were concentrated in this state in 2010, and state authorities have been criticized for caving to criminal interests and allowing impunity to prevail. Meanwhile, official reports support the idea that the sex trade could help explain why higher violence against women was concentrated in different regions to other types of homicide. Amazonas -- home to the ""hot"" zone for killings of women along the Colombian border -- is the state that recorded the most cases of human trafficking for sexual exploitation in 2012 ( pdf ). It is also a key entry point for undocumented migrants, particularly Haitians. Nonetheless, neighboring Acre and Roraima also share similar characteristics, and very few clusters of violence were registered in these states, indicating that more factors are needed to explain the high levels of femicides in Amazonas. A focus on criminal groups does not, however, tell the whole story. It is notable that the Brookings Institution found that Sao Paulo state, home to what is arguably now Brazil's most powerful drug gang, the PCC, registered no clusters of violence at all for aggregate homicides, while Rio's red zone was quite small -- mostly confined to the city itself. The clustering of high homicide rates in some of Brazil's more remote regions also suggests that social factors are key in understanding high rates of violence. The report complements a 2013 report by the Brazilian Latin American Studies Center (Cebela), which found that violent deaths in Brazil between 1980 and 2011 were largely attributable to a ""culture of violence"" fomented by state weaknesses and generalized impunity. It focuses on a handful of states in the same northeastern region where the Brookings Institution found the most ""hot"" zones. These included Rio Grande do Norte, Maranhao and Bahia, all of which saw large increases in homicides rates over the period. Para also saw a spike in murders attributed partly to these causes. All these factors -- social conditions, the presence of criminal groups, and justice systems -- must be taken together to understand Brazil's complex tapestry of violence."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Bolivia Raises Coca Cultivation Limits, Widens Legal Supply-Demand Gap. Bolivia's government has agreed to raise permitted levels of legal coca production after violent protests by farmers, in a move that exacerbates the flaw in the country's otherwise largely successful coca policy: the gap between legal production and legal consumption. On February 23, the Bolivian government and coca farmers came to an agreement for the country's planned new coca law to allow 22,000 hectares of coca to be legally planted each year, reported La Razon. The accord brought an end to weeks of violent protests by coca farmers against the law and its initial provision for 20,000 hectares of legal production. Under the terms of the current law, dating from 1986, only 12,000 hectares are allowed to supply Bolivia's legal coca market. The new law not only regulates the quantity of coca cultivations legally allowed in Bolivia, it also aims to create new mechanisms for the state to regulate production, distribution, sales, industrialization and exportation of Bolivian coca. Following the agreement with the coca farmers, the house of deputies approved the bill, which will now move to the senate, reported La Razon. Bolivia's coca bill aims to enshrine in law the policies of former coca farmer and current president Evo Morales, who has favoured engagement with rather than repression of coca farmers. The policy has largely served the Morales government well. While Bolivia's neighbors Colombia and Peru have seen coca cultivation levels rise and fall amid the push and pull of forced eradication efforts, farmers and drug traffickers, Bolivia has seen a gradual but steady decrease since 2010, at least according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) figures. However, the debate over legal limits to coca cultivation goes to the heart of the one major problem Morales' policies have yet to address: coca production remains substantially higher than the amount of the crop required to satisfy the demand of Bolivia's legal market. According to a 2013 government study, the legal coca market can be supplied with approximately 14,700 hectares of coca, meaning under the terms of the new law, more than 7,000 hectares worth of coca could find its way to the illegal cocaine market each year. The coca law also aims to address this through government involvement in the regulation of the entire production chain, encouraging sales, industrialization and even international export. However, the government has long sought out new markets or new uses for coca and has yet to find a way to significantly bridge the legal coca supply-demand gap.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Arrest of Rio Drug Kingpin Unlikely to Break Gang Control. One of Rio's most wanted drug kingpins has been arrested in a massive security operation, raising questions about how his capture might affect criminal dynamics in Brazil's second-largest city. Rogerio Avelino da Silva, alias ""Rogerio 157,"" was arrested by security forces during a December 6 operation involving some 3,000 soldiers and police officers, the Rio State Security Secretariat said in a press release. Cristiana Bento, one of the police detectives who coordinated Rogerio's arrest, told the Guardian that ""the arrest was very important to dismantle organized crime."" Police officers present during Rogerio's arrest told O Globo that the criminal leader had been under surveillance. Authorities made the arrest when Rogerio fled from a safe house where he was under bodyguard protection and attempted to hide in a home in the Parque Arara neighborhood. Rogerio 157, nicknamed for Brazil's penal code for armed robberies, was wanted on charges of homicide, extortion and drug trafficking. Authorities had offered a $15,000 reward for information leading to his arrest, following accusations that he sparked a recent turf war for control over the drug trade in Rocinha, one of the city's largest marginalized neighborhoods known in Brazil as ""favelas."" The outbreak of violence in Rocinha in September was linked to a feud between Rogerio and his former boss, Antonio Francisco Bonfim Lopes, alias ""Nem."" Nem, who was arrested in 2011, continues to run the Amigos dos Amigos gang, which controls drug trafficking operations in Rocinha. The turf war apparently erupted when Rogerio, Nem's former bodyguard, broke from the ranks of Amigos dos Amigos and joined forces with the Red Command (Comando Vermelho), one of Brazil's most powerful criminal networks. Rogerio reportedly had been altering his appearance to avoid arrest and unsuccessfully attempted to bribe police officers to release him from custody. Several police officers, whom a supervisor described as pumped up on ""adrenaline"" following the high-profile arrest, posted ""selfies"" with the captured criminal leader on social media. Bento told O Globo that Rogerio will be transferred to a maximum security prison in the Rio neighborhood of Gericino within a day. The detective also said that a request will be filed to transfer him to a federal prison outside of Rio de Janeiro state. While Rio authorities have hailed Rogerio's arrest as a win in the fight against organized crime, experts told InSight Crime that his capture is unlikely to disrupt existing criminal control over Rocinha, and could lead to further violent turf wars. Desmond Arias, an associate professor at George Mason University, told InSight Crime that although Rio authorities perceive Rogerio's arrest as a ""successful operation against someone who is making a lot of trouble in the city,"" this type of targeted action against an individual will do little to help security forces regain territorial control or stop systematic violence in Rocinha. ""Rocinha has a history of just this type of split"" between rival gang factions due to the favela's size and strategic significance for drug dealing and other illicit activities, Arias said, noting that the Red Command and the Amigos dos Amigos have sparred for control over this area in the past. Julio Altieri from the security consultancy firm Amarante told InSight Crime that Amigos dos Amigos and the Red Command will likely maintain their areas of criminal control in Rio's largest favela for the foreseeable future. According to Altieri, major turf wars are unlikely as long as soldiers and police officers continue to occupy Rocinha and media attention remains fixed there. However, he warned that territorial battles could resume after security forces pull out of Rocinha or if one of the rival criminal groups can successfully co-opt authorities. According to Altieri, Rogerio, like his former boss and current rival Nem, is likely to continue exerting control over the disputed territory from prison. Rogerio's power will stem in large part from his relationship with the Red Command, one of Brazil's oldest and strongest criminal networks, which runs its illicit activities from inside the country's penitentiaries. Altieri noted that the Red Command has the largest stockpile of weapons, money and territory of any criminal group in Rio, currently controlling almost every favela in Rio's south zone. Amigos dos Amigos on the other hand ""are not at their best moment,"" he said. The criminal group has been slowly losing its foothold in some of the favelas they once controlled and has been increasingly seeking support from other local gangs. On the other hand, Arias cast some doubt on Rogerio's ability to run operations from prison due to his recent change in gang loyalty. According to Arias, Rogerio's continuing control hinges on ""his relative strength within the Red Command and how much they are willing to go to bat for him,"" as well as his popularity on the ground in Rocinha. A resident of Rocinha who spoke anonymously to the Guardian echoed Altieri's and Arias' predictions, saying ""when these guys are jailed there is no interruption to their command. People are worried because the war in Rocinha has not ended with 157's arrest. And the unfolding of this arrest will be more confrontation, more dispute for territory."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Can Peru Rid its Election of Narco-Influence?The evidence suggests that Peru's upcoming local elections will be strongly influenced by drug trafficking, a phenomenon with a troubling historical precedent -- but one which the authorities seem to be trying to combat. In late September, mayoral candidate Lider Villasana Flores was murdered by an assassin on a motorcycle, according to reports. He had been considered the favorite to win the election for mayor of San Martin de Pangoa , Junin. The following day Edgar Zevallos, another mayoral candidate in Junin, said he had received death threats, and suggested that they were linked to drug interests. ""This responds to dark interests of people who want to be in power There are a lot of rumors. There is talk of mafias, of drug trafficking,"" he told Canal N. These events are just the latest evidence of criminal influence on Peru's October 5 local elections, in which 25 regional presidents (similar to governors), 195 provincial mayors, and 1,647 district mayors will be chosen for four-year terms, along with numerous councilors. In August, the national electoral authority (JNE) reported it had received a list of 2,131 candidates with criminal records , and later announced that they were excluding 345 of them from the elections. Around the same time, Interior Minister Daniel Urresti handed a list of 124 candidates with suspected drug ties or drug trafficking sentences to the electoral authority (though he later said one of these candidates had been included by mistake ). Of the people named on the list, 12 currently face judicial processes, 16 have been sentenced , and two banned from leaving the country. Others are under investigation. Seven candidates for regional president are included on the list: two from Huanuco, and one each from Amazonas, Apurimac, Ayacucho, Pasco and Puno. Many of the 124 candidates are concentrated in and around the country's principal coca-growing regions (see map below): the Upper Huallaga Valley, Pichis Palcazu and the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valleys (VRAEM). In keeping with this, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) for Peru and Ecuador recently reported that just three national political parties had a major presence in coca growing regions in this year's elections (many candidates belong to regional movements). Two of these parties -- Alianza por el Progreso and Fuerza Popular -- also have the highest numbers of candidates on the list of those with suspected drug ties (13 and nine, respectively). Following these reports, the head of Peru's anti-drug agency (DEVIDA), Alberto Otarola, reiterated his warnings about the drug trafficking influence among candidates , and called on election authorities to release a full list of candidates with drug ties. Peruvian Candidates Suspected or Convicted of Drug Trafficking Source: Peruvian Interior Ministry via La Republica Red: Investigated candidates Purple: Candidates with past convictions Blue: Candidates with standing convictions There is plenty of reason for Peruvian authorities to be worried about candidates with ties to the drug trade winning this year's elections, particularly in places like the VRAEM region -- a rising hub for drug flights, and the place where over half of the country's coca is produced. The question now is whether the authorities will take the necessary steps to combat this influence. After experiencing a huge drop in coca production in the late 1990s, Peru has regained the place of the world's top cocaine producer. The evidence suggests that some local and regional politicians play a role in organized crime. Last month, a mayor in the VRAEM was found dead in a vehicle that was carrying 23 packets of coca base and had been driven into a river. The former governor of Ancash, Cesar Alvarez, has been investigated for drug trafficking and was arrested in May for allegedly leading a criminal group involved in bribery and contract killings. Several of this year's candidates who have previously held political posts have been caught in compromising situations. In 2010, the nephew of then-mayor and current candidate Edgar Gutierrez was arrested in connection with a 387 kilo coca base seizure. In 2008, while serving as mayor in the Huanuco region, Luis Valdez -- who is banned from leaving the country -- was arrested on suspicions of running a criminal network involved in drug trafficking and money laundering. Mayoral candidate Pablo Maldonado Quispe, who has held this post twice in Kimbiri, Cusco, was arrested last year during an operation directed against financial operators of the Shining Path guerrillas. And when Guillermo Torres Palomino -- long accused of drug ties -- was serving as mayor of Kimbiri in 2010, police seized 400 kilos of cocaine from a convoy of trucks, one of which apparently belonged to the municipal government. Peru has for years struggled with a drug trafficking influence in politics, with accusations reaching the highest levels. Vladimiro Montesinos, the right-hand man of former President Alberto Fujimori, is suspected of having helped dictate the terms of Peru's drug trade during the 1990s. Former President Alan Garcia has been caught up in an investigation regarding the issuing of presidential pardons to drug traffickers during his time in office. Current President Ollanta Humala has himself faced accusations of links to drug money. The elections also follow a recent scandal involving congressman Jose Leon, who appeared in a video with an alleged Mexican cartel operator tied to a 7.5 ton cocaine shipment recently discovered in Trujillo, on Peru's coast. An audio recording was later released that may link the congressman to a candidate investigated for drug trafficking. The fact that both national authorities and international bodies like the UNODC are paying attention to the problem is a good sign. However, the persistence in politics of candidates accused of drug ties could suggest that all of these accusations in the lead-up to the elections will not amount to much in the end. Even if authorities make a serious effort to root out this influence, determining the true depth of narco-infiltration into local governments in remote, coca-producing areas may be a nearly impossible task."	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"US Treasury Keeps Pressure on Reeling Zetas Leadership. The US Treasury has added two alleged Zetas financial operatives to its Kingpin List as it ratchets up the pressure on Mexico's most feared organized crime group following the arrest of its maximum leader, Miguel Angel Trevino, alias ""Z40."" The Treasury sanctioned Jose Odilon Ramirez Perales, who allegedly laundered tens of millions of dollars of drug trade profits smuggled from the United States to Mexico on the orders of Z40 and his brother and presumed successor, Alejandro, alias ""Z42"" or ""Omar."" Ismael Lopez Guerrero, alias ""Gilberto Godina Guerrero,"" was also added to the list for allegedly sending large quantities of smuggled cash to Ramirez after collecting the illicit funds from the Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo, along the US border. (See attached indictment below) The move to place the men, who were both captured in Mexico last year, on the Kingpin List means all their US-based assets will be frozen -- with the Treasury stating they expect to seize approximately $20 million in goods and cash -- and US citizens are prohibited from engaging in business with them. The US government's real target with this announcement is likely Z42, who is thought to manage a good part of the financial side of the Zetas' operations from Nuevo Laredo and surroundings. Omar's ability to keep control of what is left of this now disparate criminal group may hinge on his ability to find some cash to pay off would-be government protectors, as well as internal and external rivals. The US is putting the squeeze on anything Zetas-related it can find. The Zetas' financial operations have been in the sights of the US authorities since well before the capture of Trevino. Last year, nine alleged Zetas members were indicted in Texas on money laundering conspiracy charges, among them Eduardo Trevino, alias ""Aldo,"" -- Trevino's uncle, who is now in a US jail cell for these activities. With Z40's arrest, this process is now likely to speed up, as the US authorities act on whatever intelligence they can glean from both the Zetas kingpin and the two alleged money launderers that were arrested with him."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Citizen Security Plan Struggling to Reduce Insecurity. Three years after the launch of a much-touted citizen security initiative in El Salvador, officials say the program has helped significantly reduce crime and violence. But while national murder rates have declined, other evidence suggests some important drivers of criminality remain unaddressed. El Salvador's National Council on Citizen Security officially launched the 124-point Plan Secure El Salvador (Plan El Salvador Seguro - PESS ) on July 16, 2015. The initiative's five main objectives center on preventing crime and violence, making improvements to the criminal justice system, rehabilitating and reintegrating inmates into society, attending to and protecting victims, and strengthening the institutions that are responsible for citizen security. Salvadoran authorities say the plan has led to a decrease in homicides and other crimes like extortion. In 2015, when the program was implemented, El Salvador's murder rate reached 103 per 100,000 citizens, the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean. Following the implementation of the plan, the homicide rate dropped to around 80 per 100,000 in 2016 and to 60 per 100,000 in 2017. Deputy Security Minister Raul Lopez hailed Plan Secure El Salvador in a recent interview , saying that ""the numbers speak for themselves."" And US Ambassador to El Salvador Jean Manes has credited the program for a drop in the number of people fleeing the country for the United States. (This assertion appears to be contradicted by a recent United Nations report showing the number of asylum seekers from El Salvador has more than doubled since 2015.) At the same time, critics say the 50 municipalities that the plan initially targeted were selected based on faulty criteria , and crime rates in some of those areas have actually increased. Attorney General Douglas Melendez has conceded the latter point. But rather than recommending a renewed focus on the comprehensive approach laid out in Plan Secure El Salvador, Melendez has said the government should ""intervene"" in crime-ridden municipalities and ""address the issue with force."" While officials say Plan Secure El Salvador is working, a closer look at criminal dynamics and other indicators suggests that the significant decline in the national murder rate and other crimes doesn't tell the whole story. El Salvador's declining homicide rate is indeed a positive development, though the country is still the most violent in the region after Venezuela. In addition, Salvadoran citizens are feeling safer; a recent report from the Gallup polling organization found a "" marked improvement "" in perceptions of security there. But Florida International University professor Jose Miguel Cruz questioned whether the improvement was as significant as it appears on the surface. Cruz told InSight Crime that falling homicide and extortion rates may be more indicative of a growing sophistication among the country's gangs in response to extraordinary anti-gang measures , rather than a result of Plan Secure El Salvador. ""What has happened is the consolidation of gang control in many places and communities, the sophistication of the gang's criminal activities, and the fact that gangs have increasingly moved on to other activities than extortion,"" said Cruz, who has investigated gangs in El Salvador. Beyond the statistics, there are other reasons to be skeptical of Salvadoran officials' claims about the success of Plan Secure El Salvador. For example, two of Plan Secure El Salvador's main aims are to strengthen security forces and the justice system. But credible allegations of torture and extrajudicial killings by police and military alike -- few of which have been punished -- suggest security forces remain abusive and unaccountable. Moreover, the justice system is still characterized by widespread impunity for crimes of all sorts. Cruz told InSight Crime that the limited progress Plan Secure El Salvador has made stems from a lack of adequate attention to the root causes driving crime and violence in the country, such as a lack of access to education and legitimate economic opportunities. According to Cruz, instead of focusing solely on trying to improve weak security and judicial institutions, the program ""really needs to invest and allocate more resources to education and training opportunities for the youth, low-income communities and in rural areas."" ""The big problem is that there is not any sensible policy of training, education, or providing people with new and competitive skills in the current job market,"" Cruz told InSight Crime. ""If you don't do that, gangs will continue to be the first choice for many youth."" Additionally, Cruz said Plan Secure El Salvador could benefit from a comprehensive assessment to figure out if the program is working, where it's working and where it needs to be improved. ""Nobody has conducted a scientific evaluation of Plan Secure El Salvador as far as I know,"" Cruz told InSight Crime. ""We have seen a decrease in homicides in the last couple of years while Plan Secure El Salvador has been around, but in the absence of real data linking both things, it's very hard to know if this [decline] is the result of Plan Secure El Salvador.""

"Is Mysterious Colombian Trafficker Now Worlds Most Wanted?Media outlets are heralding a little-known Colombian drug trafficker as the top priority for US law enforcement now that Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman is once again behind bars. But this stranger-than-fiction story may be mostly fiction. On January 11, BBC Mundo reported that Colombian national Maria Teresa Osorio de Serna has become the US Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) most wanted international fugitive following the recapture of Mexican drug lord ""El Chapo"" Guzman on January 8. Osorio de Serna's connection to the drug trade is not well-known -- even among those who follow Colombia's underworld closely -- except that she was a major money launderer for the once powerful but long defunct Medellin Cartel, according to the BBC. ""She is practically a ghost,"" the media outlet writes. ""Almost nobody knows of her."" How could such an unknown figure become the DEA's top priority? The BBC based their report on Osorio de Serna's appearance on the anti-drug agency's list for the Most Wanted Fugitives - International Division , which contains only two other names: El Chapo and another little-known figure, John Alexander Thompson, a suspected heroin traffficker whose nationality is not stated. Using this list as evidence, BBC Mundo concludes that Thompson and Osorio de Serna have replaced El Chapo as the DEA's most wanted international fugitives. Osorio de Serna's criminal profile provides another layer of mystery and intrigue. She is wanted by US authorities for money laundering and cocaine conspiracy, yet she has no criminal charges against her in Colombia, according to RCN. Shortly after the BBC Mundo article was published, Colombia's National Police told InSight Crime it was verifying the information it had on Osorio de Serna. Despite Osorio de Serna's placement on the DEA's shortlist of Most Wanted international criminals, it is highly unlikely she has replaced El Chapo as the world's most sought-after fugitive. Whatever her criminal profile may be, there are a number of drug bosses across Latin America that are surely a higher priority for US law enforcement. One piece of evidence that points to this conclusion is the US Narcotics Rewards Program. The program -- which is run through the Department of State -- offers no monetary reward for Osorio de Serna, but it offers millions of dollars for information on numerous other drug traffickers from Latin America. For instance, US authorities currently have a $5 million bounty on the head of Dario Antonio Usuga, alias ""Otoniel,"" who runs the Urabenos, Colombia's most powerful criminal organization. The same is true for Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias ""El Mayo,"" the most visible leader of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel now that El Chapo is once again in prison. Another good indicator of a drug lord's status in the US is how much they are sought after in their home countries. The United States is a key security ally of both Colombia and Mexico, and works closely with intelligence officials to track down the most wanted suspects like El Chapo. It should come as little surprise then that Otoniel is the subject of a massive manhunt in Colombia, or that El Mayo is set to become the principal target for Mexico's security forces. It would be a major surprise, however, if Osorio de Serna is in fact a top priority for the United States given Colombian authorities do not appear to be making a concerted effort to capture her. But the most sure-fire way of knowing that Osorio de Serna is not the most wanted drug fugitive is by asking the DEA. In an e-mail, the anti-drug agency told InSight Crime that the individuals on its most wanted lists are not ranked by priority. The DEA also pointed out that not all international fugitives appear on the shortlist containing Osorio de Serna. El Mayo, for example, can be found on the Most Wanted Fugitives list for the DEA's El Paso, Texas Division. Without more information, it is hard to know just how instrumental Osorio de Serna has been in orchestrating and facilitating international drug shipments over the years. It is certainly not unheard of for a woman to play a prominent role in Colombia's underworld. Notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar was mentored by Griselda Blanco, also known as the "" Queen of Cocaine ."" However, there is little evidence to suggest Osorio de Serna has risen to become the DEA's biggest target. The DEA's response opens up its own set of questions. What exactly is the purpose of a most wanted fugitives list, if, by all appearances, it lacks coherence and is far from comprehensive? And what does it say about the ability of US authorities to coordinate anti-drug efforts if the information on different agencies' websites is contradictory? The Narcotics Rewards Program, for example, lists El Mayo as being captured, despite his profile on the DEA's most wanted fugitives list. (In addition to being misinformed, the Narcotics Rewards Program is also severely outdated: Hector Beltran Leyva, alias ""El H,"" is still classified as ""wanted."" Beltran Leyva, the head of Mexico's once-powerful Beltran Leyva Organization, was arrested in October 2014 .) Ultimately, the BBC Mundo story tells us less about about a shadowy figure in Colombia's underworld than it does about the organizational weaknesses of US anti-drug authorities. Whether these errors are aberrations or speak to a larger problem within the DEA and other anti-drug agencies is a much more interesting question, but one that doesn't have a ready answer."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Fugitive Governor Further Damages Credibility of Mexico President. The former governor of Veracruz, Mexico has gone missing amid a flurry of corruption allegations, dealing another heavy blow to the credibility of President Enrique Pena Nieto's scandal-plagued administration. Mexican officials, who suspect that former Gov. Javier Duarte may have left the country, have requested that the international police body Interpol participate in the search for him in 190 countries, reported El Pais. Duarte resigned from his post as governor of Veracruz on October 12 to face over 50 allegations against him, according to El Pais. Officials said on October 19 that an arrest warrant had been issued against the politician for racketeering and corruption charges, reported the Wall Street Journal. Miguel Angel Yunes -- Veracruz's governor elect who is set to take office on December 1 -- claimed that Duarte fled the state on October 15 aboard a helicopter provided by the current interim governor, Flavino Rios. Interior Minister Miguel Osorio Chong has since denied the possibility that Duarte escaped with help from the national government, adding that there are no legal records of the former governor leaving the country. According to investigations by Mexican authorities, Duarte and the Veracruz government embezzled over $26 million in state funds by handing out false public contracts to ""ghost companies,"" Animal Politico reported. In September, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional - PRI) suspended Duarte's party membership in the first such move in the party's history , according to PRI President Enrique Ochoa Reza. Duarte has been embroiled in criminal allegations for years , and his precipitous fall from grace will do little to help a national government already smeared by numerous scandals. Since taking office in 2010, Duarte is considered by some analysts to be responsible for plundering the economy of the oil-producing region and facilitating the local growth of organized crime. Murders and disappearances have shot up to record levels under Duarte's administration. He has even been accused of involvement in the killing of journalists in Veracruz, which has become the most dangerous state in Mexico for that profession. As El Pais points out, it was hoped that Duarte and other PRI governors under Pena Nieto's administration would revitalize the party's image , which had been tainted by corruption and clientelism. But the ruling party is unlike to come out from the Duarte case unscathed. Indeed, corruption is already thought to have cost the PRI a number of wins in the June 2016 gubernatorial elections ."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"El Salvadors Nayib Bukele Tainted by Money Laundering Allegations. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele is at the center of a complex web of financial transactions, which show he received millions of dollars from a subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, PdVSA. An investigation by Revista Factum revealed that Bukele, who became president in June, received $1.9 million from Inversiones Valiosas S.A. (Inverval) in 2013 when he was mayor of the small town of Nuevo Cuscatlan, near the capital. Inverval is owned by Alba Petroleos, an El Salvador-based subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA), the Venezuelan state-owned oil firm that is under heavy sanctions by the US Treasury Department for being a vehicle for corruption. The ties between Bukele and Alba Petroleos emerged in May 2019 after El Salvador's Attorney General's Office opened a money laundering inquiry into 23 companies, including Inverval. Interval funneled the cash to Bukele -- a rising star in the then-ruling party, the left-wing Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional -- FMLN) -- as campaign donations. Inverval also made donations to a company belonging to a family friend of Bukele and other close associates, who now serve in the president's cabinet. In total, Bukele and his associates received over $3 million from Inverval, according to Factum. Part of these funds were then used by Bukele to invest in Starlight, a company also funded with Venezuelan capital. Starlight owns the TVX television station, which Bukele used to further his political career. Interval money also financed luxury real estate developments in Nuevo Cuscatlan when Bukele was mayor. One Inverval executive said that he had given $500,000 to the mayor's office, according to Factum. In turn, Interval had been exempted from paying taxes on the real estate projects. Both Inverval and Starlight were almost entirely financed with funds from Alba Petroleos, according to files from the Attorney General's Office. Alba Petroleos was founded in 2006 by PdVSA as part of an international campaign of subsidies by which Venezuela's former president, Hugo Chavez, maintained political alliances in Central America and the Caribbean. In March 2019, Alba Petroleos and Albanisa, a PdVSA subsidiary in Nicaragua, were sanctioned by the US Treasury Department as part of its measures against PdVSA. After Factum published its investigation, Bukele admitted having received $1.9 million from Inverval. The money, he claimed, had been for the sale of Starlight, which he said belonged to him. However, Bukele was never registered as an owner of Starlight, only acting as its guarantor, according to an investigation by El Faro. In a press conference, Bukele said that the deal had happened before accusations emerged against Alba Petroleos and that he had dealt exclusively with Inverval. ""To be honest -- which company didn't receive money from Alba Petroleos if you remember, at the time Alba Petroleos entered the Salvadoran market with billions of dollars and invested in other companies,"" said the president. Suspicions that Alba Petroleos was engaged in money laundering first emerged in 2010, according to a May filing by the Attorney General's Office to explain its inquiry into the finances of the 23 companies. The ties between the president of El Salvador and Alba Petroleos have rung alarm bells about potential corruption in the country's new government. With just four months in office, Bukele has remained extremely popular, with an approval rating of between 80 and 90 percent. Since these revelations, a new investigation by El Faro has linked Bukele to money coming from associates of Herbert Saca , one of El Salvador's most questionable political operators. Saca has in the past been linked to the Perrones local drug trafficking gang. He also allegedly participated in a corruption ring that bribed parliamentarians during the administration of former president Mauricio Funes between 2009 and 2014. As these revelations surfaced, Bukele's administration has sought to prevent journalists from Factum and El Faro from carrying out their work, including barring them from official press conferences. As part of his anti-corruption agenda, Bukele announced in September his plan to create an international anti-corruption commission, similar to the United Nations-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG). For the moment, this commission only exists on paper and it is unclear what independence it will have, according to Factum's reporting. For now, these suspicious financial dealings have dealt an early blow to Bukele and his vow to clean up corruption in El Salvador."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Criminal Groups Benefit from Mexicos Crackdown on Migrants. Criminal groups and corrupt officials are the main beneficiaries of a US inspired shift in Mexico's policy that is endangering migrants, according to a new report, and the recent US decision to allow more Central American immigrants refugee status will do little to protect them from abuse south of the Rio Grande. Mexico's crackdown on undocumented migrants crossing its territory in hope of reaching the United States has forced them into ""more costly, circuitous and dangerous channels,"" says the report from the International Crisis Group ( ICG ), This policy has made migrants even more vulnerable to violence at the hands of organized crime. The Zetas are the criminal network most active in the kidnapping and extortion of Central American migrants in Mexico. But some 20 percent of migrants reported having suffered ""crimes at the hands of authorities, including robbery, extortion, beatings and illegal detentions,"" according to a survey of 31,000 people by a Mexican non-profit that is quoted in the ICG report. The number of migrants detained and deported by the Mexican government has increased dramatically in the last four years. This tough stance was in part due to US pressure to staunch a surge of Central American migrant children arriving at the US/Mexico border in 2014. Mexico detained 190,366 undocumented migrants in 2015, compared to 66,583 in 2011. Nearly 90 percent of those migrants came from Central America countries, many fleeing criminal gang-related violence back home in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. In fiscal 2015, Mexico returned 166,000 Central Americans to the isthmus, including some 30,000 children and adolescents, while the United States deported more than 75,000. That forced repatriation has slowed this year to just over 57,000 between January and May ( PDF ), according to figures from Mexico's Interior Ministry (Secretaria de Gobernacion - SEGOB). The ICG report warns that ""beefed-up border control inadvertently fuels human smuggling and fortifies criminal gangs that increasingly control that industry."" The Rev. Alejandro Solalinde, a Mexican Catholic priest and outspoken advocate for migrants in Mexico, said in a recent interview with news website SinEmbargo that it is organized crime that ultimately decides who crosses the Mexico-US border thanks to the complicity of authorities on both sides. Women and children are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation by criminal gangs, which create networks of sex workers, holding many women against their will. The sex industry at Mexico's border with Guatemala is a byproduct of the human trafficking industry, and criminal organizations also profit indirectly from the sex trade by charging for protection, ICG reports. Human traffickers -- called coyotes or polleros -- who charge migrants to help them cross Mexico and enter the United States have been ""subsumed, subordinated or used by networks dedicated to migrant kidnapping,"" according to Rodolfo Casillas, an expert on migration and organized crime quoted in the report. Smugglers and their clients have to pay between $600 and $1,000 in protection fees to organized crime groups for each migrant, and those who cannot pay are often kidnapped, the report says. Mexico's Human Rights Commission (Comision Nacional de los Derechos Humanos - CNDH) said in 2013 that 11,000 migrants are kidnapped every year. The report also notes that Mexico is increasingly becoming a destination, rather than a transit country, for Central American migrants. It says asylum applications in Mexico have more than doubled and more are being approved. Still, the vast majority of crimes against migrants go unprosecuted. The US State Department announced plans on July 26 to expand its existing program allowing Central American minors to enter the US as refugees to include the children's families, a move that prompted criticism from the Republican Party, reports the New York Times. The United States also entered into a partnership with Costa Rica under which that country will serve as a host for migrants whose asylum applications are being processed. With help from The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) and the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ), the United States will also start processing applications in the applicants' country of origin in cases involving minors and their families, an attempt to dissuade them from making the dangerous journey north across Mexico. The violence visited on migrants in Mexico by the Zetas and other organized crime groups is nothing new. In August 2010, 72 Central American migrants were murdered at a ranch in San Fernando, Tamaulipas. Several possible motives for the massacre have been reported, including the migrants lack of money to pay protection fees or refusal to work for the criminal organization. Reports of migrants being killed, kidnapped and extorted continue to be common. Until 2014, Mexican authorities largely turned a blind eye to the flow of migrants from the Northern Triangle passing through their territory, despite widespread media attention focused on the northbound freight trains migrants cling precariously to, known collectively as ""la bestia"" (the beast). Thousands of migrants have been killed or maimed falling under the wheels of these trains. Most migrants who risk riding the trains are charged a tax by the Zetas, or opportunists claiming to work for the group, and some are thrown off if they can't pay. There have also been reports of the Zetas trying to recruit Central American migrants into their ranks. Unlike most of Mexico's criminal organizations, the Zetas focus more on violent enforcement and protection rackets than drug trafficking. The group, started by special forces officers who defected from the Mexican military, specializes in ""taxing"" other criminal organizations for operating in Zeta-controlled territory. When children from Central America began to surge across the Mexico-US border in 2014 , President Enrique Pena Nieto came under pressure to stem the flow from the Obama administration. Mexico's federal government launched the ""Frontera Sur"" crackdown, which involved immigration officials backed by the Federal Police and the army hauling migrants off the trains and pulling them from buses and the cheap hotels they patronize, reported the Los Angeles Times. Mexico started to detain and deport more migrants than the United States as a result, stopping them before they could get to the border. To avoid detection, many migrants have stopped riding the trains and and are taking less visible routes which actually increase their vulnerability to various forms of abuse and exploitation. It's unlikely the changes to US policy on Central American migrants will have much impact on the crimes perpetrated against migrants in Mexican territory. ""It's a positive step, but [it's] difficult to see how it could be scaled up sufficiently to offer protection to the large numbers of people who need it, and it doesn't address the problems in Mexico,"" Mary Speck, author of the ICG report, told InSight Crime via email. The ICG report urges the United States to establish processing centers for asylum seekers in Mexico and Central America to prevent them from risking the dangerous journey to the border. ICG also urges Mexico, once again, to end the impunity enjoyed by organized crime and corrupt officials who exploit migrants in that country."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Guatemalas Anti-Corruption Crusader Faces Arrest. A Guatemalan judge has issued an arrest warrant for former attorney general and current presidential candidate Thelma Aldana, who previously led several high-profile corruption cases against political elites. The unexpected warrant comes at a moment of extreme political tension in Guatemala, between the government of President Jimmy Morales and the entities investigating him, including the Attorney General's Office , which Aldana headed until last year. The warrant is based on accusations of embezzlement, lying, and tax evasion. The charges stem from alleged contractual irregularities from when Aldana was in that role. Melvin Medina, the attorney general in charge of administrative misconduct, says Aldana hired former Supreme Court lawyer Gustavo Bonilla to train staff in the Attorney General's Office, but that this training never took place, despite Bonilla charging 20,000 quetzals ($2,600). Aldana, who last week was named as the presidential candidate for the Semilla Movement party (Movimiento Semilla), has publicly denied the accusations and claims that a corrupt group of politicians led by Morales is trying to stop her from running for president. ""They are afraid of me running because I will continue the fight against corruption. A lot of people are worried about it,"" Aldana told Prensa Libre. Some lawyers claim Aldana's registration as a presidential candidate grants her immunity from arrest. However, the director of the electoral registration process, Leopoldo Guerra, said that she would only be granted legal protection for three days, ending March 22, during which time other parties can challenge her registration. Aldana, who is currently visiting El Salvador, has postponed her return to Guatemala while she evaluates her legal situation. Thelma Aldana, who took on high-profile corruption cases against political elites as Guatemala's former top prosecutor, has long faced claims of wrongdoing, racking up 18 formal accusations , mostly by her political opponents. According to Salvadoran news outlet El Faro, the most recent accusations come from the political party Todos. A prominent Todos member, Vice President of Congress Felipe Alejos, is currently being investigated by the MP and the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG) for his suspected involvement in a criminal network. Alejos, whose clout in Congress has been instrumental in protecting President Jimmy Morales' own immunity, created a commission in September 2018 to investigate Aldana's alleged involvement in the irregular purchase of a building to be used by the ministry. Aldana worked closely with CICIG commissioner Ivan Velasquez to take on elite corruption, including conducting high-profile investigations into illicit financing during the 2015 presidential campaign. CICIG's ongoing investigations into illicit campaign financing implicate both Morales' ruling party -- the National Convergence Front (Frente de Convergencia Nacional - FCN-Nacion) and that of presidential candidate Sandra Torres - the National Unity of Hope (Unidad Nacional de la Esperanza - UNE) -- who is currently neck and neck in presidential polls with Aldana. The timing of the warrant -- signed one day before Aldana registered as a presidential candidate -- adds weight to her argument that a corrupt political mafia is abusing government institutions to ensure that the one candidate most likely to disrupt the status quo of elite corruption and impunity does not assume the presidency."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Reports of Human Trafficking Rise Dramatically In Brazil. The number of reports of human trafficking in Brazil has risen 1,500 percent in 2013, according to government figures, indicating an increased awareness of a crime, which remains a major problem in the country. The Secretariat of Women's Policies announced a dedicated government reporting hotline had registered 263 allegations of the crime during the first six months of the year, compared to 17 over the same period in 2012. Of those 263 cases, 170 were reports of international human trafficking, while 90 related to cases inside Brazil. Most of the international reports were of sex trafficking, while 42 were accusations of labor trafficking and 2 of organ trafficking. Of the domestic reports, 64 were of sex trafficking, 25 were of labor trafficking and 1 case an illegal adoption. Around 20 percent of all reports were made by the alleged victim's mother, 16 percent by the alleged victim herself, 23 percent by relatives or neighbors, and the rest by friends, colleagues, ex-boyfriends or former victims. In just over one-third of the cases the victim's life was considered to be at risk. The Minister of Women's Affairs Eleonora Menicucci attributed the rise in reports to the success of publicity campaigns by the government, which had increased awareness of violence against women and publicized the existence of the hotline. Brazil's vast economic inequalities provide the perfect conditions for human trafficking to flourish, with a steady stream of desperate people vulnerable to exploitation and no shortage of wealthy people to pay for them. Its emerging economic strength has also helped fuel labor exploitation and made the country an increasingly attractive destination for poor international migrants. On the plus side, human trafficking has risen up the political agenda in Brazil in recent years, with the government introducing its first national anti-trafficking action plan in 2008. Its second $2.9 million national plan, announced earlier this year , will see a revision of the penal code and new control posts set up in ten border towns. Since 2008, 16 anti-trafficking offices have been set up across the country and more recently ""well-publicized media campaigns about trafficking warning signs"" have been launched, according to the US Department of State's 2013 Trafficking in Persons Report. The dramatic rise in reports of human trafficking show the campaigns are clearly having an effect. What's needed now is an accompanying rise in investigations and prosecutions: last year there were just six convictions for domestic sex trafficking and two for international sex trafficking."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Message from Zetas to Guatemalas President. The following is a message allegedly from the Zetas criminal organization, played by the local radio station La Buena in Coban, the capital of the beseiged province of Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, on December 27. The Guatemalan government declared a state of siege in the province on December 19, which includes increased search and seizures, arrests and detentions of suspects and military checkpoints. Several arrests and confiscations have been made, but local journalists in Coban tell InSight Crime that the Zetas may have been tipped off by the police that the measures were coming and escaped before army reinforcements arrived. They fear that the gang, which was the former enforcement arm of the Gulf Cartel in Mexico that expanded into Guatemala in 2008, may be regrouping, prepaing for a counterassault. The core of the Zetas leadership are former Mexican and Guatemalan military personnel, giving the radio message extra currency. Propaganda is a central part of any military strategy, and the radio message, it appears, may be preparing the terrain for more concerted military and political action by the group. To be sure, in the radio message (available below), the Zetas make reference to the ""bigote"" (mustache), a possible reference to Obdulio Solorzano, a former Guatemalan congressman who was assassinated in July in Guatemala City. Solorzano, sources tell InSight Crime, may have been the Zetas bagman and connection to President Alvaro Colom, who the Zetas say took $11.5 million in campaign contributions from them. The message also says Colom betrayed the group by handing Ottoniel Turcios, a Guatemalan drug trafficker who was captured in Belize in 25 October. The Zetas are also known to threaten journalists in Mexico into serving as their spokespeople. In this case, the reporter says the people who gave him the message gave the station an hour to play it or the group would burn down it down. Radio transmission (translated by InSight Crime): This is a message to the President of Guatemala. We are the Zetas group, and we just wanted the country to know that President Alvaro Colom received $11,500,000 before elections ended. He will pay for failing to comply, be it [via] guilty or innocent [people]. We will start the war in this country, in malls, in schools and in police stations in this country. These will be the payments of the $11,500,000 that the president owes. The person who sends this message is the same one who gave [the president] the money. He has license plates and the addresses where the money was handed over, and, you, Mr. President, are the one who sold the country out to the Zetas. Now you will pay the price, surprises that will come with actions not words. Proof will be what happens in Alta Verapaz. In these coming days, in a meeting center, many people will die. Comply with your promises or fight with the beast. You killed mustache (""Bigote"") and you handed over to the DEA [Ottoniel] Turcios because they were the people who gave you the money. Now the only one who is missing is you. If this message is not put on the air in an hour, the radio station will burn, if you fail to get this message out. The families of those who work at the station will be executed if you do not read it. And if you do read it, their lives will be spared. And don't think this is a joke, because this is going to be a nightmare for the President of the Republic, Alvaro Colom. We are serious people and we will act. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Target of Facundo Cabral Murder Faces Drug Trafficking Charges. Henry Farinas, the target of the attack that killed Argentine folk singer Facundo Cabral in July, is facing drug trafficking charges in his home country of Nicaragua, raising the possibility that the attempted hit was drug-related. On Saturday, a Nicaraguan prosecutor filed charges of drug trafficking and money laundering against Farinas, who was arrested Thursday. The Associated Press reports that Farinas (pictured) is accused of helping a drug trafficking organization known as the ""Charros"" to move narcotics from Costa Rica to Nicaragua, and may have had links to the Colombian Rastrojos drug gang. Six others were indicted, including US citizen Gerald James Shackelford, who remains at large, reports the AFP. Farinas owns the Central American night club chain Elite and was thought to be the target of the attack that killed Facundo Cabral on 9 July last year in Guatemala. The indictment accuses Farinas of using shows by international artists, like Cabral, to launder money. The man alleged to have ordered Farinas' murder, Costa Rican Alejandro Jimenez Gonzalez, alias ""El Palidejo,"" was arrested in Colombia last month and has been extradited to Guatemala to face murder charges. He is believe to have served as a key link between the Rastrojos and the Mexican Sinaloa Cartel. In the aftermath of the July 9 assassination attempt, Farinas told Guatemalan investigators that Jimenez had plotted to kill him because he refused to sell the Costa Rican branch of Elite for $400,000. These claims have not been corroborated, and the trafficking charges against Farinas make it more likely that the hit was drug-related, particularly if both had ties to the Rastrojos, as has been claimed. The fact that Farinas' arrest came so soon after Jimenez's suggests that Jimenez may have started cooperating with the authorities, as a retired senior police chief told El Nuevo Diario. As InSight Crime has noted , Farinas appears to be well connected in Nicaragua, as evidenced by the defense of the night club owner by Nicaragua's Supreme Court President Alba Luz Ramos when Guatemalan authorities suggested he may have been the target in the attack, and by the failure of Nicaragua's authorities to successfully gather evidence against him in the past, despite suspicions of criminal ties. His detention therefore suggests that Nicaraguan authorities may have decided to sacrifice him, possibly to protect someone higher up who is involved in drug trafficking and money laundering.

"Did Mexico Really Arrest Chapo Guzmans Daughter?The detention of a woman claiming to be the daughter of "" Chapo "" Guzman is sure to reignite interest in the family of the evasive Sinaloa Cartel leader, although there are still plenty of unanswered questions about the case. The woman, identified as Alejandrina Gisselle Guzman Salazar, was arrested on October 12 while trying to enter the United States from Tijuana on foot, after US authorities identified a fraudulent visa in her Mexican passport. During questioning, she said she was Guzman's daughter, an identity that was reportedly confirmed through a check of her fingerprints. According to the Los Angeles Times, the woman is a medical doctor who is seven months pregnant, and said she was attempting to enter the United States to give birth and meet up with the baby's father in Los Angeles. A cedula, or an identification card, issued in 2005 to an Alejandrina Gisselle Guzman identifies her as a medical surgeon who studied at the Autonomous University of Guadalaja, apparently confirming the LA Times' report. Chapo Guzman is believed to have had at least three wives, including former beauty queen Emma Coronel, who gave birth to twins in Los Angeles last year. He had three sons with his first wife and three sons and a daughter, Griselda, with his second wife. There are no previous reports of another daughter, although it is possible she was born out of wedlock. Mexican newspaper El Universal identifies her as a daughter of Chapo's first wife, Alejandrina Maria Salazar Hernandez. Casting further doubt on the case are mistaken reports that one of Chapo's sons was arrested in June this year. It's possible that the Alejandrina arrest is another case of mistaken identity and over-hasty reporting. The case is also curious because the daughter of the world's most wanted drug traffickers would presumably be able to procure better quality false papers. However, there is precedent for members of the Guzman clan crossing the US border to give birth, with the case his wife last year. If Alejandrina is really El Chapo's daughter, this could indicate a ""family connection"" to southern California, as Eric Olson, associate director of the Wilson Center's Mexico Institute, told the Washington Post. In addition, Alejandrina Guzman Salazar has reportedly hired San Diego-based criminal defense attorney Jan Ronis to work on her case. Ronis has represented members of the Arellano-Felix family , which makes it seem likely that Guzman Salazar really is a member of El Chapo's clan, if she has the influence and the cash to contract Ronis. One question is what kind of intelligence Guzman Salazar will be able to offer US law enforcement. Different members of the Guzman family have varying degrees of involvement in the Sinaloa Cartel's criminal activities. Guzman's first wife and his son Jesus Alfredo were both blacklisted by the US Treasury Department earlier this year. There is also a wide network of cousins, nephews, and in-laws who work for the Sinaloa Cartel -- including a cousin of Guzman's who was sentenced to 21 years in prison in Mexico 2010, and a nephew who was recently gunned down at a family party. Other members of the Guzman family are less involved with Chapo's criminal businesses, including his mother, who reportedly lives peacefully in a country home which her son built for her in rural Sinaloa, as ""The Last Narco"" author Malcolm Beith has reported ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Bomba de tiempo en calabozos policiales de Colombia por hacinamiento. Honduras plans to modernize its fleet of Tucano aircraft with technical assistance from Brazil, where the airplanes were manufactured. Honduras was set to buy at least four Super Tucanos from Brazil, but will put the purchase on hold until after Brazilian technicians come to Honduras to repair the older aircraft, according to El Heraldo. Honduras' Air Force includes at least 10 Tucanos, acquired in 1982 and 1983. Many are in poor condition. One became inoperable in a 2011 accident, intensifying the need for an upgraded fleet. Military authorities have repeatedly said that Honduras is under-equipped to properly confront the increased levels of drug trafficking inside the country. The former head of Honduras' armed forces, Romeo Vasquez Velasquez, recently told La Prensa that the country cannot make progess in the ""drug war"" without modern radar systems. As InSight Crime has reported , Honduras' 2012 military budget has allocated few funds towards the purchase of technology needed to fight drug trafficking. The gaps have forced Honduras to solicit aid from donors like Brazil and the US. Brazil's offer of technical assistance reflects both the country's expanding role in regional security, as well as a recognition of Honduras' increased prominence as a transit point for cocaine shipments to the US. The country's defense minister has said that 87 percent of the cocaine exported from South America to the US travels through Honduras along the way. US estimates have said that between 20 to 25 tons of cocaine travels through Honduras each month. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Kidnapping Figures Drop, Skepticism Remains. Mexico has registered substantial declines in its rates of kidnapping in 2015, seemingly addressing one of the lingering challenges of the current security landscape. As reported by Excelsior , according to the National Public Security System (known as the SNSP for its initials in Spanish), through the first ten months of 2015, Mexico has tallied 1,064 kidnappings. This represents a 32.4 percent drop from the corresponding figure of 1,619 in 2014. The trend for extortion was similar, if not as drastic: after opening 5,400 investigations into alleged extortions from January through October 2014 , this year the figure slipped to 4,479, a decline of 17 percent. Many of Mexico's most populous and violent states registered the biggest declines. Mexico State, by far the nation's largest state by population, saw 145 kidnappings from January to October 2014, compared to 124 over the same period this year , a drop of 14.5 percent. The proportional decline was even larger in many other key regions. Kidnappings in Nuevo Leon plummeted from 37 to 17, a 54 percent decline. In Sinaloa, they fell from 17 to 9, 45 percent less. In Guerrero, Mexico's most conflictive state over the past several years, kidnappings dropped from 95 to 68. While the presidency of Enrique Pena Nieto has coincided with a sharp decline in the murder rate, the frequency of kidnappings has been more resistant to decline. As InSight Crime reported in 2013, the initial drop in murders at the outset of the Pena Nieto presidency contrasted with an uptick in reported abductions. Earlier this year, Animal Politico reported that the first 27 months of Pena Nieto's presidency registered 52.7 percent more kidnappings than the final 27 months of Felipe Calderon's term. Over the past ten years, large criminal organizations have fragmented and their remnants have diversified into crimes such as extortion and kidnapping, as well as other activities like human trafficking, car theft, and the theft of primary resources. The SNSP indicates that from 2007 to 2012 -- in essence, Calderon's first and last year in office -- the national figure for kidnappings more than tripled, leaping from 438 to 1,418. The number of extortion cases more than doubled from 3,123 to 7,284. While Mexico's murder rate has rightfully received a great deal of attention as a barometer of organized crime, kidnapping and extortion have a comparable or even greater impact on popular sentiment regarding public security. Unlike organized crime-related murders, in which gunmen and their bosses typically aim for rivals and leave ordinary citizens alone, extortion and kidnapping frequently target non-combatants. It is no coincidence that even as murders have declined substantially under Pena Nieto, popular perceptions of public security remain persistently grim. It stands to reason, then, that amid the current decline in kidnappings, Mexico's citizens will likely express a greater level of confidence in the nation's security. However, a complicating factor in looking at kidnapping and extortion, and one that demands significant skepticism in interpreting government figures, is the fact that the vast majority of such crimes are not reported. A successfully realized extortion racket or kidnapping for ransom will not leave evidence, and victims have a powerful disincentive against reporting such crimes. Estimates derived from victimization surveys suggest that approximately 98 percent of kidnappings are never reported to authorities, and would therefore never appear in the SNSP statistics. The reliability of reporting varies tremendously from state to state. In Chihuahua, where some of the nation's most powerful gangs operate and home to the key border crossing and former world's deadliest city Ciudad Juarez, the SNSP has tallied just 11 cases of extortion and six kidnappings, both of which are absurdly low. The figure of nine cases in Sinaloa is similarly unbelievable. Statistics revealing trends from one year to the next should theoretically be more reliable, but this relies on the rate of this non-reporting, known in Mexico as the ""cifra negra,"" remaining constant. In fact, a drop in the cifra negra from 98 percent to 97 percent, which could respond to random variation or to any of several other possible factors, would account for virtually all of the variation in the SNSP figures from 2014 to 2015. Of course, a drop in the number of registered kidnappings is much preferable to the alternative. But before anyone celebrates a victory on this key challenge, the SNSP trend needs to continue for years to come, or it must be corroborated by other sources. Otherwise, it's not clear we are looking at much more than noise."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Overcrowded, Too Few Guards and Easy Access to Drugs in Paraguays Most Crowded Prison. The June 2019 massacre of 10 Rotela Clan members by First Capital Command (Primer Comando da Capital - PCC) inmates at the San Pedro prison in Paraguay sheds light on the critical situation in which the South American country's penitentiary system currently finds itself. Prior to his resignation in late October, InSight Crime spoke to Jorge Fernandez while he was still director of Tacumbu prison, Paraguay's most populated, overcrowded and understaffed jail where Rotela Clan and PCC members coexist. Despite Fernandez's claims of peace in the prison, shortly after his resignation, the nephew of Rotela Clan leader Javier Armando Rotela was murdered in Tacumbu on November 1. InSight Crime (IC): What is your day-to-day like in the prison? Jorge Fernandez (JF): The day-to-day here is never the same. A problem could arise at any moment, of any nature, due to the overpopulation. The place is designed for 1,500 inmates and there are almost 4,000 inmates. IC: How many prison guards are there? JF: Ideally there should be 100 guards on each shift. We currently have between 40 and 43 per shift, and this number is actually halved because one group works while the other rests. Therefore, at a certain point during the night and at dawn, there are between 20 and 22 guards for the 4,000 inmates. There are three shifts every 24 hours. The guards basically do not rest, it is very difficult. There are sectors where two guards are assigned for 700 inmates. In other words, the only thing they can do at any given moment is close the gate and run, because what else are they going to do? IC: How is the prison divided? JF: This prison is very atypical, because there are wings here which can hold 50 inmates in the same location, sleeping in double and triple bunks, all watched by cameras. Also, convicted felons and inmates still awaiting trial are mixed together. There is no way to divide the different sectors, separate them and say, ""here are just murderers, here are just rapists,"" no, they are all together. Of the 4,000, we only have 956 convicted felons, the rest are all awaiting trial. Then we have Christian wings, which really work well, but those are also overpopulated. IC: What are these ""Christian wings?"" JF: We have three Christian wings that spread ""the word of God."" There are Adventists and Catholics. To enter, you have to follow their rules. When a prisoner wants to live there, the pastor in charge reads them the rules, and they must accept them. And if they violate the rules, they can throw you out. Here everything is done is a specific way, prayer and mealtimes are at specific hours. Their rules are very clear. But essentially, all the wings here are peaceful. Inmates live and eat well here as food is a priority. When we took over here, we audited management because the inmates were not eating well and this led to inmate uprisings. IC: How do you view this job? JF: There is no place to study to be the director of a prison in Paraguay, you have to learn as you go. The inmates, as long as they behave well, are never going to have problems with me. If they do misbehave, I can yell at them or put them in solitary confinement. I only have to sign a paper for them to be transferred away from here. IC: So when you transfer an inmate, is it because they've misbehaved? JF: Of course. The problem we have here is with the ""pasilleros,"" those inmates that enter and leave frequently for minor crimes. They are usually drug addicts, who rob in order to buy drugs. There are almost 1,000 inmates here under this category. There is no addiction treatment center here, these centers desperately need to be created so those who rob to be able to buy drugs can go elsewhere. But they become criminals because of their drug addiction, they steal and end up here and the situation gets worse. IC: But once they are in prison, they will still try to buy drugs? How do they do that? JF: They can find items to sell or they can work in the prison, doing cleaning or other tasks. Here, they need less than a dollar to buy drugs. They only need 500 guaranies [around $0.07] to buy enough crack to last a whole day. IC: Is crack the most used drug inside the prison? JF: We have found marijuana, cocaine and crack. Controls are currently being stepped up, but we don't have the necessary infrastructure to confront the whole situation. We now have a new administration that is looking at a way to obtain the necessary technology to detect drugs. We do not have a scanner for the men's wings, we only have a working scanner for the women's wing. The scanners could be used to see inside bags, to see if there is anything there. Right now, it's a lot of effort. Paraguay allows four weekly visits to prisons on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays. On a Tuesday or Thursday, 850-900 people enter but that climbs up to 2,000 on Saturday or Sunday. So [with inmates plus visitors], there are between 6,000 and 7,000 people here on weekends. IC: With so many weekly visits, this must mean a large quantity of contraband can enter? JF: An inmate can receive food from their family until 7 pm. They can bring them pizza or meat, the food is inspected and then handed over to the inmate. But on visit days, families even use children to bring in drugs. What worries me more is weapons, our current means of control [physically checking visitors one by one] requires a lot of effort. There is no scanner, so they will manage to bring contraband in one way or another. We make constant inspections [inside the prison] and we mostly find homemade knives. Alcohol and drugs are usually caught at the entrance. But we know that some guards are involved in this system as well. IC: What strategies do you have to address this? JF: Having the necessary technology would make it easier. We only have one entrance and exit here, so it is not complicated. But, for example, I asked the SENAD (National Anti-drug Secretariat) for help with anti-drug police dogs, but they are also worn out from work and can only come once a week. We were told that there is no proper training provided for the prison guards? JF: No, the majority of the staff have been here for between 20 and 25 years. They simply came in with their identification, their military service record and birth certificate. These are the three requirements because this prison used to have only 700 inmates, all convicted prisoners. Now, it has evolved to what is it today, the prison has two avenues, it even has permanent settlements outside where people sell drugs. This is not normal, the prison is like a mini-city. IC: It must be a very unusual prison. JF: Yes. It is like a marketplace, there are people who work honestly selling food or running bars, for example. That is allowed. An inmate with money can buy his food. If not, we prepare food in a renovated kitchen which is first-rate. The area where guards sleep has also been fixed up. It used to be a pigsty, the roof was collapsing and leaking. There was an order from the president to make prisons livable, we have done what we could with the money available. I manage the medicine personally, they are stored in my office, or they will end up on the black market. IC: How many inmates have died this year? JF: Around 15 to 18. More than half were due to natural causes and the others died in fights. But the prisoners remain quiet, they never say who was to blame or that it was a fight. IC: Why do the fights happen? JF: Most often, it's about debts to be paid. But there have been some isolated cases related to clans which did not get along with the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC). The massacre in San Pedro was large because there were two big groups [of Clan Rotela and PCC inmates]. Here, we are managing the situation. Most of the inmates work, they understand that a problem affects everyone and it is not in anyone's interest. I have told them that, in case of a big problem [like a riot], the army will come in. I tell them to use their heads, I am always talking with them, asserting control, I walk around the prison to ensure they behave. By talking with them, I can understand the things they need. IC: Are there members of the PCC and the Rotela Clan here? JF: Yes, but they are separated, identified and communicate. IC: They speak? JF: Yes, there is dialogue up to a certain point. If they have problems, we organize a meeting between the two leaders and we participate in the meeting. We ask what the problem is and try and find a solution. They know that it is not in their interest to kill each other. IC: How do other inmates view these more organized groups? Do they get involved? D: No one gets involved, to each their own. When they want to cross the line, we set up meetings and that's it. IC: Can you provide an example of problems that were resolved diplomatically? JF: I once received information that there was going to be an attack from the prisoners of one wing on those of another. I cannot tell you who the gangs involved were, but they were going to attack one another. So, we called the leaders and we made them talk it out with my security chief and I. IC: Was this before or after the San Pedro massacre? JF: It was after the San Pedro massacre. We understood that the problem had started due to gossip spread by a gang member. One piece of information had been exaggerated. It ended, they hugged, and we made them pass the word around. * The interview transcript was edited for greater clarity and brevity."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Dominicans, Chinese Smuggled via Uruguay to Argentina. At least 50 Chinese people have been smuggled through Uruguay in the last two years, perhaps signalling the country's growing importance as a human trafficking hub to move people in neighboring Argentina. A report by Uruguayan national newspaper El Pais said human smuggling of Chinese and Dominican citizens is becoming more common in Uruguay as local ""coyotes"" -- criminals who facilitate illegal migration -- build up routes across the country into Argentina, which has become a regional human trafficking center. The Chinese migrants travel by plane to Brazil, where they are not required to have an entry visa. There, coyotes meet the migrants and transport them in trucks to the scarcely-monitored Uruguayan border. From there, the migrants are passed to other coyotes who smuggle them into Argentina via the River Uruguay. Coyotes may use false paperwork and contacts with corrupt government employees to move the migrants ""officially"" across the border. Once in Argentina, migrants are usually taken to Buenos Aires, often ending up in situations of forced labor or sexual exploitation. The same logistics are used to transport Dominicans who arrive in Uruguay from Santo Domingo with false documents or tourist visas, according to El Pais. Most are women under the age of 25, who wait in hotels or apartments in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo for the opportunity to cross into Argentina. Uruguayan police have been investigating cases in which Dominican women have been forced to work as prostitutes during this waiting period. That human smuggling is increasing in Uruguay is no surprise, given the profits available across the border in Argentina, where sex and labor trafficking have become a serious problem. More than 700 people were rescued from human trafficking networks during the first half of 2012 , according to figures from Argentina's Ministry of Justice, with more than half of the victims from outside the country. Argentina's relative affluence, compared to most of its neighbors, make it an attractive prospect for human traffickers, who capitalize on income disparity to find both victims and clients for their trade. As the El Pais report highlights, cases of human smuggling -- in which migrants pay to be willingly smuggled into another country -- can easily morph into human trafficking cases, in which victims are forced into labor or sexual exploitation. One of the challenges facing the Southern Cone nations is how to fully dismantle these smuggling networks, given that the migrants being transported through Uruguay often do not become victims of trafficking until they are forced into situations of exploitation in Argentina. Argentina has made some moves towards confronting the problem, passing the country's first anti-trafficking legislation in April 2008. Since the law's passage, more than 3,465 trafficking victims have been rescued. But with Uruguay serving as a transit nation for potential human trafficking victims bound for Argentina, the problem is a transnational one."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"El Salvador Police Use Uniforms to Distinguish Jailed Members of Rival Gangs. Police in one San Salvador municipality have reportedly responded to overcrowding by asking detained members of the country's two largest gangs to wear different uniforms, an attempt to create stability that may have the unintended consequence of strengthening gangs. Police of the Soyapango municipality have informed the families of the inmates in holding cells there that they may bring the inmates colored clothing: yellow for members of one gang, white for the other, said a police source, according to La Prensa Grafica. This is a response to overcrowding and escape attempts in the facility, which is running at 300 percent over capacity. Prisoners are only meant to be held there for 72 hours, but 80 percent of detainees have already passed this mark, reported the newspaper. Authorities have also reportedly stepped up searches, in order to stop detainees holding illicit objects that could be used in escape attempts or to commit crimes inside the facilities. The ""mano dura,"" or ""iron fist"" policy of mass arrests of suspected gang members, introduced in 2003, resulted in a surge in the population of Salvador's prisons. This threw gang members in together, allowing them to regroup and get more organized. Forcing together members of rival groups the Mara Salvatrucha ( MS-13 ) and Barrio 18 led to increased violence. This led authorities to separate the two gangs from one another inside some prisons, which in turn intensified the process of regrouping, as the gangs were safer and had more time to focus on expanding their activities, building nationwide extortion networks. Members of the two gangs are now sent to separate prisons, according to a 2010 InSight Crime investigation. Meanwhile, El Salvador's murder rate doubled between 2003 and 2011. The reported overcrowding in holding cells like that of Soyapango is the result of massive overcrowding in prisons, and judicial gridlock. Separating gangs in these facilities may actually make them stronger, as it did in prisons. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Jamaica Sees 20% Spike in Murders. Jamaica has suffered a sharp uptick in murders this year, raising fears that a shift in the island nation's criminal dynamics is to blame. As of August 24, 775 people had been murdered this year in Jamaica, according to government statistics obtained by The Gleaner. This figure represents a 20 percent increase over the same period in 2014, when 643 people were killed. According to The Gleaner, 12 of Jamaica's 19 police divisions have reported an increase in homicides. The parishes of St. James and Clarendon have seen a 60 percent and 42 percent increase in murders, respectively. Derrick Smith, Opposition Spokesman on National Security, said Jamaica was in the midst of a ""murder wave,"" and that ""every month for this year, including August, is showing an increase [in murders] over the last year."" However, National Security Minister Peter Bunting estimated 2015 would end with ""about 1,200 murders,"" the same amount as 2013 ""and almost 500 fewer than the 1,692 murders in 2009."" Jamaica's murder count has fluctuated in recent years. For instance, the 1,124 murders recorded in 2011 marked the country's lowest homicide rate since 2003. Yet violence spiked once again in 2013 , with the rise in murders blamed on increased gang activity. In 2014, Jamaica registered a total of 1,005 homicides, a 16 percent decrease from the previous year. Jamaica's powerful -- and politically influential -- gangs have regularly been pointed to as a principal cause of violence ; the rise and fall of homicides in certain areas appears partly attributable to shifting gang feuds and truces. The recent spike in murders may therefore reflect changing dynamics in Jamaica's criminal underworld -- similar to what occurred following the 2010 arrest and subsequent extradition of famed Jamaican drug kingpin Christopher ""Dudus"" Coke. The power vacuum created by his detention led to heightened violence as competing groups jockeyed for control of his criminal empire. Government officials have offered their own hypotheses for what could be driving violence in Jamaica this year. Smith blamed the murder spike on the country's economic troubles, saying it has made young men ""feel hopeless,"" and thereby ""making them easy targets for criminal gangs."" Bunting, without further elaboration, said there were several factors contributing to a rise in violent crime, ""many of which are outside the control of law enforcement."""	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"New Powers for Honduran Military Will not Clean Up Law Enforcement. Honduras has granted policing powers to its military, a controversial move which could damage rule of law in the country, where the armed forces already have a tendency to overreach their remit. On Tuesday, the Honduran Congress voted to approve a new interpretation of the constitution which would grant policing powers to the country's armed forces. This gives the military legal authority to stop, search and arrest individuals suspected of engaging in criminal activity. Previously, the military could only serve as an auxiliary force to the police during routine patrols and targeted counter-narcotics operations. The latest measure comes as an official endorsement of an emergency decree backed by President Porfirio Lobo, who earlier this week called on lawmakers, media outlets and civil society organizations to support military involvement in internal security ""so that Honduras may find peace and tranquility."" According to the Honduran government, the move is necessary in order to end the surge of violent crime. While Honduras has long served as a significant base for drug trafficking organizations, their influence was heightened in the chaotic period following the 2009 coup that removed then President Manuel Zelaya from office. During Micheletti's five months in office, security analyst James Bosworth estimates that up to 1,000 tons of cocaine may have passed through Honduras. This has had a massively impact on street crime. According to a recent report by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) , Honduras has the world's highest homicide rate, with 82.1 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. To make matters worse, the Honduran police are notoriously corrupt, a fact which was illustrated recently by the revelation that police have ""lost"" thousands of confiscated weapons , many of which ended up on the black market. Lobo holds this corruption up as further justification for the military to take on law enforcement responsibilities. The military's role will be over, he claims, when the police have been purged of corrupt elements and able to effectively administer the rule of law. But the strength of the government's commitment to police reform remains unclear. The Lobo administration framed the arrest earlier this month of 176 police officers on charges of connections to kidnapping plots and drug trafficking as part of a national crackdown on police corruption , when, in fact, they were all assigned to the same police station in Tegucigalpa. This is the station where police are suspected of having murdered two university students , meaning that their arrest was likely more related to the case than part of a nationwide purge of the country's 11,000 police officers. More recently, El Heraldo reported that the President Lobo was in the process of gathering a ""black list"" of police officials with questionable backgrounds, but the 40 or so names on the list are likely to only scratch the surface. Given, then, that the police have been infiltrated by criminal elements, the argument is that the military could do a better job of fighting crime. This is a common incentive for the militarization of citizen security in the region, and the governments of Bolivia , Ecuador and Venezuela have all recently begun to involve their armed forces more heavily in law enforcement. However, this policy has a number of drawbacks. For one, the Honduran military's reputation is far from spotless. In addition to its controversial role in the harsh post-coup crackdown, the armed forces have been the subject of corruption allegations. According to a U.S. diplomatic cable leaked last spring , elements of the army apparently sold light anti-tank weapons to criminal organizations in Mexico and Colombia. The other major problem is that the duration of the military's new powers has been left rather vague. The new law will be in effect for ""at least"" 18 months, but because Honduran law allows for emergency decrees to remain in place indefinitely, no one knows how much longer it could be applied. Such indefinite use of the army for policing could compromise its political insulation, tempting military officers to use their position to influence the political process. This was one of the main reasons that such a strong barrier between the police and military was put in place in 1986, after the country had been under military rule for the preceding decade. There are signs that the barrier between military and civilian power is already weakening. According to El Heraldo , Romeo Vasquez, the general in charge of the post-coup crackdown, is gearing up to run for the presidency in 2013. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Denies Hiding Chapo Guzman. Mexico's attorney general denied that the authorities were protecting Sinaloa Cartel head Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias ""El Chapo,"" and said his capture was a top priority for the government. Marisela Morales stated that the authorities have recently made big steps forward in the search, capturing important members of Guzman's structure, including the arrest in March of his in-law and close associate, Victor Manuel Felix Felix. The prosecutor also pointed out that the government offers rewards to those who provide information on the whereabouts of the drug kingpin. The government has faced accusations that it favors the Sinaloa Cartel , and that it has allowed Guzman to remain on the run. The pressure is mounting on the Mexican authorities to track down the Sinaloa leader, who has been on the run since escaping prison in a laundry basket 10 years ago. Since the death of Osama bin Laden, Guzman has been described by some media as the world's most wanted man. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Guatemalas First Coca Farm Signals Expansion of CentAm Experiments. The first-of-its-kind discovery of a coca farm in Guatemala may be a sign that drug trafficking groups looking to cut risks and transport costs could be expanding experiments growing drug crops in Central America, a region that has traditionally been used to transit rather than produce drugs. On May 26, Guatemala's National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil de Guatemala - PNC) announced the discovery and destruction of almost one hectare of coca that had been sown between coffee plants, calling it the first-ever evidence of cocaine production in the country. The crops were found in a mountainous region six hours by foot from the central city of Coban, which is the capital of the department of Alta Verapaz. A small laboratory was also found near the coca farm. It contained materials commonly used for turning coca leaves into cocaine base, such as gasoline, cement and acid. The discovery of coca farms in Central America seems to be growing more frequent. In Honduras, for example, authorities recently found a 14-hectare field of coca, and a year before that they found another 8-hectare farm. Honduran authorities explained the phenomenon as an ""experiment"" in which Colombian criminal groups could be testing the conditions of the country to begin cultivating and processing coca leaves closer to the United States to reduce the risk and subsequent costs of seizure. It is possible that the same is happening in Guatemala, above all because the farm and laboratory do not seem to have been sophisticated enough for large-scale production. Furthermore, they were located in an area with the perfect conditions for testing because it had already been controlled by organized crime in the past and had little government presence. ""What's interesting [about this news] is the location where the farm was found,"" Walter Menchu, an analyst with the Guatemalan Center for National Economic Research (Centro de Investigaciones Economicas Nacionales de Guatemala - CIEN), told InSight Crime. ""When the Zetas moved into Guatemala in 2008, Coban was one of their centers of operation And Alta Verapaz is located on one of the drug trafficking corridors that passes through Guatemala,"" he added."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"FARC Massacre 7 who Impersonated Rebels in Extortion Racket. Colombian rebels are believed to be behind the massacre of seven people who pretended to be the FARC in order to extort money, as the guerrillas step up their extortion demands across the country. Seven people, six from a single family, were murdered by rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ) in their stronghold of San Vicente del Caguan, in Caqueta province. Most of the victims, among them two women, were from the Espitia family, which has been under investigation for extortion, and police are working on the theory that those killed had been engaging in extortion, using the FARC name, and the fear it inspires, to ensure swift payment. San Vicente del Caguan was the capital of the 42,000 square km (16,000 square mile) safe haven that former President Andres Pastrana granted the FARC during the failed peace process from 1999-2002. During the peace process it was the site for talks, and the rebels put down deep roots in the local communities. The police are blaming the killings on the FARC's elite Teofilo Forero Mobile Column, a sort of Special Forces group within the rebels. Up to 15 armed fighters arrived, dressed in black uniforms, at the Espitia house and killed all those within. The Teofilo Forero engages in extortion not only in Caqueta but the neighboring department of Huila. Neiva, Huila's capital, suffers from systematic FARC extortion , with the rebels punishing those that do not pay by blowing up property, an almost weekly occurrence in the city. Most of the massacres in Colombia (there were 184 last year, according to official statistics) are carried out by new generation narco-paramilitary groups (called BACRIM or ""bandas criminales"" by the government), but it seems that the FARC wanted to make an example of this family and send the message that they will not tolerate anyone using their name. The massacre coincides with an increase in extortion nationwide, particularly by the FARC and their smaller cousins, the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN ). This is the fastest growing income stream for the rebels, now second only to drug trafficking and ahead of illegal gold mining, from which both rebel groups profit. As kidnapping, once a major source of FARC revenue, has fallen (from 2,882 cases in 2002, to 282 in 2010), the FARC have had to find alternative sources of income and have increased their extortion efforts acoss the country. In the last few months at least 20 such demands have been sent to mining and oil company headquarters in Bogota, as the FARC seeks to get a cut of the boom that these sectors are experiencing. Kidnapping and extortion used to be linked for the FARC. If extortion demands were not met then the rebels would kidnap family or company members. However, relentless U.S.-backed military offensives since 2002 have forced the rebels to break down into smaller groups and become totally mobile, seldom spending more than one night in the same place. This has made it much more difficult to cart around kidnap victims, and so the FARC now punish failure to pay extortion demands by damaging property instead. The use of improvised explosive devices and grenades to target shops, hotels and businesses has become commonplace throughout the country. Senior police figures privately admitted to InSight Crime that they know extortion has increased exponentially over the last couple of years, but that, due to unwillingness to report cases, they are not sure what the scale of the problem is or how much the FARC are earning from it. However, revenues are estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars. "	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
"New Graft Investigations Target Dozens of Top Brazil Officials. A long-running corruption scandal in Brazil involving numerous elites has expanded once again after a judge approved petitions to open investigations into dozens more politicians, including several top officials in the current government, for their suspected involvement in a massive graft scheme. On April 11, Brazilian Supreme Court judge Edson Fachin authorized new investigations of upwards of 70 suspects who were implicated in corrupt activities in plea bargain testimony provided by executives of the country's largest construction firm, Odebrecht S.A. The testimonies were obtained from dozens of current and former executives of Odebrecht, a company that has publicly admitted that its ""Division of Structured Operations"" paid officials from governments across Latin America a total of nearly $800 million in bribes over more than a decade in order to secure public works contracts. Almost half of the total amount of the bribe payments was made in Brazil. According to a database compiled by O Globo , Fachin's decision raises to 97 the number of Brazilian politicians under investigation by the Supreme Court in connection with the scheme. (Brazil's legal system requires the Supreme Court to approve and carry out certain types of investigations against top government officials.) A prosecutor working on the case said last month that the Odebrecht executives' testimonies could lead to ""upward of 350 new investigations"" related to the case. Among the names on ""Fachin's List,"" as the Brazilian media has dubbed it , are those of eight ministers in the administration of current President Michel Temer, including his chief of staff, his general secretary, his foreign minister and others. In addition, more than 60 of the country's 594 senators and congressional representatives, including lower house President Rodrigo Maia , were named on the list, as were several governors. Relatedly, each of Brazil's five most recent presidents has been implicated in the Odebrecht scandal. Four of these -- Dilma Rousseff, Luiz Inacio ""Lula"" da Silva, Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Jose Sarney -- will face corruption investigations in a lower court. The remaining ex-president, Fernando Collor, will be investigated by the Supreme Court due to his status as a current senator. Current President Temer has also been linked to the scandal, but he cannot be investigated because he has ""temporary immunity"" as president. Former Odebrecht President Marcelo Odebrecht has testified as part of a plea deal that both Rousseff and da Silva were aware that the firm was involved in making large illicit payments to support their presidential campaigns. Da Silva denied wrongdoing and criticized prosecutors for ""accusing everyone without proof"" in a recent interview with Radio Metropole. Temer has also dismissed the allegations against him. Rousseff and Cardoso have not commented publicly. Other elites from around the region have also been tied to the scandal. For example, Marcelo Odebrecht testified that former Peruvian President Ollanta Humala received some $3 million in campaign funding from the company. Another ex-president of Peru, Alejandro Toledo, is wanted in his home country for allegedly taking some $20 million in bribes from Odebrecht. The continued expansion of the Odebrecht investigations could impact political and economic stability in Brazil, which is currently facing the worst recession in its history. The probes now being launched against so many top officials -- combined with Temer's abominable approval ratings , which are barely hovering above the single digits -- could complicate efforts to implement policies and pass legislation necessary to deal with the country's urgent economic challenges. This could have implications for the country's broader security situation. For example, budget shortfalls were blamed for a wave of crime and violence earlier this year in the state of Espirito Santo, where a military police strike left the streets with a severe shortage of officers. Similarly, a budget crisis in Rio de Janeiro spurred the federal government to send thousands of military police to reinforce security in the city ahead of its world-famous Carnival celebration in late February. Additionally, chronic underfunding of the country's hellish prison system has allowed gangs to turn penetentiaries into bases of recruitment and operations, as well as bloody battlegrounds for conflicts with rival groups. In the absence of successful action by the Brazilian government to get the economy back on track, such problems are likely to persist -- and potentially worsen -- posing a serious threat to security in Latin America's largest and most populous nation. At the same time, many questions remain regarding the outlook for the new investigations. Past experience suggests that these cases will move slowly through Brazil's overburdened Supreme Court, and there is the possibility that some of those accused may take plea deals that reduce their sentences in exchange for providing information relevant to the probes. It is also possible that political elites may band together to pass some sort of amnesty for those accused of involvement in the Odebrecht scandal, though such a move would have to overcome significant political obstacles. While recent anti-graft investigations in Brazil have gained widespread popular support for helping to expose the systemic nature of corruption in the country, their ultimate impact remains to be seen. Historical examples of similar wide-ranging anti-corruption drives in other countries, like Italy , suggest that such efforts do not always result in entirely successful outcomes."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Nicaragua Govt Says Police were Ambushed, Killed. Five police officers were killed in a notorious drug trafficking hub in Nicaragua, an unusual outbreak of violence in one of Central America's most peaceful nations. According to a statement by police , on August 15, five officers attended a local assembly in order to discuss security issues in a small town in the municipality of Bluefields, along the Atlantic coast. This municipality is a significant transit zone for the transnational cocaine trade, as detailed in a special report by InSight Crime. The police officers reportedly arrested an unidentified suspect who belongs to a criminal group that operates in the area. The criminal organization later ambushed the police and killed them in order to release the detainee, police said. According to La Prensa , police authorities said they would hold a press conference to release more details about the incident but then canceled the event. Naval forces and a police commission are investigating the incident, the newspaper reported, adding that none of the slain officers were from the Bluefields area. The region previously registered a police massacre in 2004, when four officers were tortured and killed. Members of an alleged drug trafficking group known as the Renazco family were investigated for allegedly hiring Colombian assassins to carry out the job. However, a court found them not guilty of the crime. Compared to neighboring countries Honduras or El Salvador, Nicaragua registers much lower levels of violence, and incidents that result in multiple police casualties are unusual. Still, given Bluefields' status as a key transit area for cocaine moving northwards in go-fast boats, the version of events provided by Nicaraguan authorities is a plausible scenario. However, it is worth questioning why police have not released more details about the incident or what criminal group may have been involved. In addition to the Renazco family, there are multiple criminal actors that operate in Bluefields. These include the Tarzanes, based in the southern part of the area, and local businessman Francisco Zeledon , who allegedly runs a drug trafficking network in the region, although he has never been charged with a crime. What's more, Nicaragua is thought to have a more top-down underworld in which high-level government officials oversee the movement of drugs and other illicit goods for a price. Should a criminal group seek to bypass these officials, there are consequences. But until we have more official information, this case may be hard to decipher.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Use of Mexicos Marines in Drug Ops Down 40% Under Pena Nieto. The number of Marines involved in counternarcotics operations in Mexico has fallen 40 percent since Enrique Pena Nieto took power, in another sign of Mexico's shifting security priorities. Under Mexico's previous president, Felipe Calderon, the Marines grew to have over 20,000 active agents, many of whom were used in counternarcotics operations including raids targeting top drug traffickers and ""high impact"" deployments to violent hotspots. However, since the start of last December, when Pena Nieto assumed the presidency, the number of Marines involved in counter-narcotics operations has dropped to just over 14,000 -- a 40 percent reduction on November's levels, reported La Jornada. According to naval sources consulted by La Jornada, the reduction is part of the strategy being implemented by new Navy Commander Vidal Francisco Soberon Sanz, which is more focused on intelligence gathering. The fact that the use of the Marines in such operations has dropped under Pena Nieto fits with his revised security strategy , which is moving away from the type of dramatic and confrontational military operations the marines specialized in. Instead, Pena Nieto says he plans to take a less militaristic approach focused more on prevention. The new president is also planning to deploy a gendarmarie to hotspots. It's not clear if this will be in addition to, or a replacement for, the vast military presence in numerous areas where organized crime is battling with each other and the state. The Marines have been the US government's top ally in its fight against organized crime in recent years. But they have also come under scrutiny for their possible participation in human rights violations, something that may give the US pause when it considers further assistance to Mexico in its war on drug trafficking organizations."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Killings by Police in Rio de Janeiro Highlight Training, Oversight Flaws. New statistics show that police in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil continue to use lethal force at high rates, a dynamic that is likely the result of poor training and widespread impunity for abuses by security forces. Brazil's Institute for Public Security ( Instituto de Seguranca Publica - ISP) reported that police forces in the state of Rio de Janeiro killed 84 people in February 2017, a 71 percent increase compared to the same month last year, when ISP registered 49 killings. (See InSight Crime's chart below) The increase is part of an ongoing trend. Killings by police have generally increased over the past several months, reaching a peak of 105 in December 2016 -- a staggering figure considering only 28 killings were reported for the same month a year before. Since March 2016, according to the ISP's data, the monthly number of killings by police has always exceeded the figure registered for the same period the previous year. To be sure, the number of incidents of use of deadly force has slightly decreased in the past three months, dropping from 105 in December 2016 to 84 in February 2017, but killings by police continue to be a concern across the state. Advocacy groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have found evidence that killings by police in the city of Rio de Janeiro have often been illegal , as security forces shot unarmed or wounded suspects. But police authorities counter that the use of deadly force has increased as a result of the deterioration of the security situation across the state. ""Police officers must flip a switch in their heads, at times acting as defenders of rights and other times as warriors, because there's a real war,"" Ivan Blaz, a spokesperson for Rio's military police, told O Globo. The number of civilians killed by police far outstrips the number of police killed by civilians. While at least 140 people have been killed by Rio police so far this year, just 46 officers have lost their lives, on and off duty, according to Blaz. In the latest incident of excessive police violence in Rio, a cellphone video shot during a gun battle between security forces and suspected members of a drug gang showed officers executing two men lying on the ground outside a school, the New York Times reported. A 13-year-old schoolgirl was also killed in the crossfire. The two officers have been arrested. The high number of killings by police in the state of Rio de Janeiro has been linked to poor police training practices and widespread impunity in cases of alleged abuses committed by security forces. A 2014 study published by the Center of Applied Judicial Research (Centro de Pesquisa Juridica Aplicada - CPJA), shed some light on the violence and bullying that police offers are often subjected to during training. Of the 21,000 public security officers interviewed in the CPJA report, 39 percent stated they had suffered physical or psychological torture during training; and 64.4 percent said they had been disrespected or humiliated by their superiors. The findings are worrisome, as the violence police officers suffer from during training seems to influence how much force they will be ready to use when interacting with the general population. ""How am I going to serve society being trained like that? It's ridiculous,"" a former military policeman told Agencia Publica in 2015. ""Police have to learn quick thinking, the ability to make decisions. But right now they train police as they would a dog for a street fight."" Other studies have linked the widespread use of lethal force by security agents to the impunity they enjoy in court. According to Amnesty International, police killings are normally classified as ""resistance killings,"" in a way that places blame on the victims while generally absolving the officers responsible for their deaths. Of the 220 homicide investigations into police forces started in 2011 in the city of Rio, Amnesty reported that after four years, only one officer had been charged."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Rastrojos Leaders Negotiating With US: Colombia Govt. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos confirmed rumors that the leaders of the Rastrojos drug gang are negotiating their surrender with the US. Santos declared that the leaders, brothers Luis Enrique and Javier Antonio Calle Serna , were negotiating as a result of the continued pressure being exerted on their Rastrojos group by Colombian authorities. Commenting on Colombia's collaboration with US authorities, he added, ""when we work together and we work against transnational crime, the results are faster and more efficient,"" reported El Tiempo. Santos confirmed that the Rastrojo leaders are in talks with the US after former paramilitary warlord Hector Buitrago, alias ""Martin Llanos,"" was arrested in Venezuela. Rumors of the Calle Sernas' dealings with US authorities first surfaced in August last year when Colombian daily El Pais reported that Javier Antonio was negotiating his surrender following a June 2011 indictment by the Eastern District of New York on drug trafficking charges. A move such as this by a high-profile drug trafficker is not unprecedented. Colombia's most notorious trafficker, Daniel Barrera Barrera, alias "" El Loco ,"" and the now-captured Maximiliano Bonilla, alias "" Valenciano ,"" both apparently began negotiations with the US, only to break them off later. The decision to start negotiating with US justice is one sign of an organization under pressure. Once a drug trafficker's activities have grown to such a point that a US extradition order is issued, it becomes very difficult to operate with the same levels of impunity, as InSight has previously noted. In the case of the Calle Sernas, however, it is a case of time as to whether their offer of submission is sincere. As evidenced by Barrera and Bonilla, should the terms offered to them not be favorable, they will simply walk away and continue to run their organization. Furthermore, the Rastrojos are currently locked in a fierce battle with the rival Urabenos gang. Last year the Urabenos began making inroads into the Rastrojos' home turf of Cali, and have had successes in strengthening control of highly-prized trafficking routes out of Medellin to the Caribbean coast. If the Calle Sernas were to remove themselves from the picture, it could potentially weaken the Rastrojos to the point of insignificance and see them overrun by the Urabenos. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Gang in Mexico Offers Drug Menu  Via Encrypted WhatsApp. A drug gang in Mexico City is providing menus of its products and making deals via WhatsApp, in a case that shows how dealers exploit encrypted technology to reach customers while skirting authorities. The messaging service WhatsApp provides sellers with a much easier way to reach customers than would otherwise be possible through a cell phone service. One well-known Mexico City drug gang, Union de Tepito, even provided its WhatsApp clients with a ""drug menu,"" El Universal reported, with prices and emojis representing its products. About 10 drugs were listed, including cocaine of varying quality and price, ecstasy (by the pill or gram), methamphetamine, and crack cocaine, among others. In the past, customers looking to buy drugs had to venture into dangerous and crime ridden neighborhoods within the city. Microtrafficking groups also sell near soccer fields, bars, clubs and tourist districts. In 2017, security officials said there were some 20,000 ""narcotienditas,"" or drug trafficking points, throughout the capital. The use of WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging services by drug gangs has taken off recently in Latin America. In Brazil , authorities busted a ring that sold synthetic drugs such as ecstasy through a group chat of some 200 people. In Colombia , a drug trafficking network used the messaging service to reach high school and college students. And screenshots of drug menus in a WhatsApp chat were published by a twitter user in Argentina. While WhatsApp has become one of the most popular methods for drug dealers to connect with clients, Facebook and applications such as Kik, Wickr, Signal and Discord are also used. The ease of reaching and interacting customers through such applications partly explains their increasing use in drug sales. Another benefit is the end-to-end encryption offered by some of these services, providing dealers and customers a sense of security that they are not being surveilled by authorities. That's not always the case, though. For example, in the United States, judges have demanded that Whatsapp install a technology that enables calls and messages to be tracked in drug investigations, Forbes reported. These intercepts don't provide authorities with message content, but they do scoop up unencrypted metadata information, such as the date, time and duration of communications. Governments have also examined legislation that requires the decryption of communications for police and intelligence agencies. Just last year, Australia passed a bill that forces technology firms decode messages believed to be linked to terrorism or organized crime, Bloomberg reported. In Latin America, no such workarounds exist, but authorities have found another way to take down microtrafficking groups using the messaging services: simply infiltrate the chats. Such sleuthing was responsible for the busts in both Colombia and Brazil. Communication advances have long transformed the drug trade. Whatsapp is just the latest example."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Crime Groups Win in Colombia - Venezuela Border Closure. Venezuela's decision to close its border with Colombia in 2015 has been hugely profitable for criminal groups, who now have unprecedented control over contraband movements in the region. Nearly 10 months ago, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced that the country was shutting down its border with Colombia. Since then, former paramilitary groups (also known as ""bandas criminales"" - BACRIM) in the Colombian department of Norte de Santander have become more powerful than ever, according to an investigation by La Silla Vacia. ""The new form of income for the BACRIM on the border is the extortion of smugglers,"" the director of Progresar Foundation, Wilfredo Canizares, told La Silla Vacia. ""It's generating exorbitant earnings."" Border control officials report a 70 percent decrease in contraband gasoline traffic since the border closure and the accompanying security crackdown. Much of the contraband business is now controlled by the Rastrojos and the Urabenos BACRIM groups. These criminal organizations control unofficial crossing routes known as ""trochas,"" where they tax individuals, vehicles, and smugglers of gasoline and other goods. ""Nothing moves here without them knowing,"" an inhabitant of Puerto Santander municipality -- one of the main contraband hubs -- told La Silla Vacia. ""They maintain order and everyone obeys them."" Venezuelan and Colombian security forces are also profiting from the contraband trade, La Silla Vacia verified during its visit to the area in and around Cucuta, the capital of Norte de Santander. Locals told reporters that an individual crossing clandestinely into Venezuela may have to pay five ""taxes"" per journey -- to the Venezuelan National Guard, the Colombian police, the BACRIM, the transport provider and the owner of the land being crossed. Including the bribes, a car crossing can cost $20. According to reports, the Rastrojos have been active in Norte de Santander since 2007, while the Urabenos -- now stronger than their predecessors -- arrived in 2011. People in the area fear referring to the groups by name, instead calling them the guides, or ""paracos,"" which is slang for paramilitaries. Almost a quarter of all the 217 illegal crossing points identified along the Colombian border are located in Norte de Santander, where recent anti-contraband operations have resulted in the arrest of 50 smugglers, and in the seizure of 70,000 gallons of gasoline -- three times higher than during the same period in 2015. Nevertheless, gasoline and diesel traffickers continue to traverse the border with ease, and illegal crossings destroyed by authorities are readily replaced by the BACRIM. As La Silla Vacia's investigation clearly shows, the Colombia - Venezuela border closure has boosted the revenue of organized crime and stoked official corruption in the region. Norte de Santander is already one of most profitable territories in Colombia for drug trafficking and contraband activities, making it home to a number of criminal groups, including the BACRIM and several guerrilla factions. These organizations' border presence became a huge asset for them after Venezuelan President Maduro announced that the international crossing was to be closed in August 2015, blaming violence and criminal activity in the area. InSight Crime field research in Norte de Santander determined that until that time, contraband had largely been a ""mom and pop"" operation, with individuals smuggling small quantities of goods into Colombia along both official and informal routes. When this was no longer possible, contraband shifted to unofficial border crossings away from the main bridges, where organized criminal groups struck deals with corrupt elements of the Venezuelan National Guard and began to control and charge for the illegal transit. Here, goods are driven along hidden paths and shipped across the river border under the watchful eye of the Venezuelan military and Colombian armed groups. Such arrangements can easily turn violent; Venezuelan military officials have been known to attack smugglers that refuse to pay them extortion fees. These crossings are not exclusively controlled by the BACRIM, however. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) -- who are currently engaged in peace negotiations with the Colombian government -- also manage cross-border contraband in certain parts of Norte de Santander. Further east, in the department of Arauca, the National Liberation Army (Ejercito Nacional de Liberacion - ELN) guerrilla group runs similar operations. As Venezuela's economic and social crisis continues to grow, criminal dynamics in Colombia's border region have mutated in other ways. The cheap Venezuelan produce that for years saturated local supermarkets and restaurants is now scarce, and there is evidence that foodstuffs are now being smuggled in the opposite direction to feed the socialist country's chronic shortages. There are also reports that BACRIM groups on the border have been recruiting Venezuelan migrants as smugglers and hired guns. During a recent visit to Arauca, InSight Crime found that widespread poverty across the river border had caused an influx of Venezuelans working as prostitutes. Large-scale immigration has also allegedly provoked a rise in land invasions, unemployment and drug consumption. However, border regions have also reported a drop in violent crimes such as homicide and armed robbery , which has been attributed to it being more difficult for Venezuelan criminals to enter the country."	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
Mass Arrest of Brazil Police as Investigation into Judges Death Continues. A state attorney general in Brazil ordered the expulsion of 34 military police officers in Sao Goncalo, where a high-profile criminal judge was gunned down in August in a murder linked to the military police. Arrest warrants were issued for 28 of the police officers, who are charged with committing extrajudicial killings, reports Terra Brazil. The officers all serve in the military police's 7th Battalion, based in Sao Goncalo, which has been accused of police brutality. According to data kept by Human Rights Watch , in 2009 at least 62 police officers committed suspicious killings they claimed were carried out in self-defense. The Attorney General's Office in Rio de Janeiro state added that more military police may be removed from their posts in the coming weeks. Authorities said the request is not connected to the ongoing investigation into the murder of Patricia Acioli , a judge in Sao Goncalo known for her tough rulings against local militias , many made up of former police officers. Acioli was reportedly the only judge in her district who would handle homicide cases involving the 7th Battallion. In many cases Acioli ruled against the police whose defense was that they had killed suspects who were resisting arrest. No one has yet been formally charged with Acioli's murder. Her enemies were many, including one of Sao Goncalo's most prominent local militias which ran the suburb's illegal transport networks. 	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Why is the FARCs Biggest Bloc Facing a Financial Crisis?Emails sent by commanders of Colombia's FARC guerrillas suggest that the rebels' largest bloc is facing a cash flow crisis, although this may have more to do with the weakening ties between the rebel fronts than a drop in criminal revenues. The emails, which were obtained by Colombian newspaper El Espectador , offered a snapshot of the broad portfolio of financial interests managed by the Eastern Bloc of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). They detailed the FARC's holdings in everything from construction and farming machinery to properties, describing nearly $30 million of assets in land and livestock alone. However, despite these riches, the emails also described the Bloc's problems with ""economic cash reserves,"" and debts rung up in purchasing weaponry, supplies and in business deals. As previously reported by InSight Crime , in one email, FARC leaders call for a broadening of extortion rackets on oil companies and the African palm and ranching sectors, so they can guarantee ""an economic base that will at least give us enough to eat."" In another email, the Bloc commanders complain they are ""eating up capital"" and relying on cattle sales to survive -- which, they estimate, will give them just enough funds for a year. The Eastern Bloc is the FARC's most powerful bloc in terms of territory and numbers, covering seven departments in eastern Colombia. According to El Espectador , the Bloc is made up of nearly 4,000 fighters in 37 fronts, three columns and 15 mobile companies, although other recent estimates have put the number of rebels at less than 3,500. Not only is the FARC's Eastern Bloc involved in the wide range of businesses detailed in the emails, it is also one of blocs most deeply involved in the drug trade. The Bloc controls coca growing hotspots such as the department of Meta, and within the FARC, it was one of the pioneers in processing and exporting cocaine in bulk. Given this rich vein of income, it is surprising that the Eastern Bloc's commanders are facing a financial crisis. One possible reason is they have begun to wind back their involvement in drug trafficking or other criminal activities. However, a more likely scenario is that the profits are still there -- it's just that the various fronts that make up the Eastern Bloc are not handing over the cash to the upper command. As detailed in an InSight Crime investigation , the Eastern Bloc is increasingly fragmented and is one of the FARC factions that will most likely spawn breakaway criminal groups that remain involved in the drug trade, should the guerrillas demobilize. Sources consulted by InSight Crime for this report suggested that the commanders of individual fronts within the FARC -- who were unsure about the current peace process with the Colombian government -- were increasingly holding onto their profits instead of handing it over to the bloc commanders."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Police Break Up Bolivia-Brazil Drug Trafficking Ring. Brazilian police have broken up a drug trafficking ring that moved cocaine from Bolivia to Brazil, disrupting supply in one of the region's main trafficking routes, which is often controlled by Brazilian prison gangs. Close to 200 Federal Police agents were deployed to execute 52 arrest warrants, bringing to a conclusion a year-long investigation, reported EFE. According to the most recent reports , 38 of the wanted people have so far been arrested. The alleged traffickers were based in the cities of Pontes and Lacerda in Mato Grosso, a central Brazilian state that borders Bolivia. From there, the gang moved the drugs on to the Amazonian states of Para, Tocantins and Maranhao, according to police. Over the course of the investigation, police made 10 seizures, totaling approximately 560 kilos of cocaine, and arrested 13 people working as drug mules. Most Bolivian cocaine is trafficked out of the country via Brazil or Argentina, where it is either sold on those countries' sizable domestic markets or moved on to Europe. Trafficking routes to Brazil are often controlled by Brazilian organized crime groups such as the prison gang First Capital Command (PCC), which is believed to maintain a significant presence in Bolivia. However, InSight Crime's recent field investigation in Peru uncovered evidence that Bolivian criminal groups may be more involved in international trafficking than is commonly thought, as Bolivian organizations fly Peruvian coca base into Bolivia, where it is processed into powder cocaine and sold on to Brazilian traffickers. According to Brazilian government estimates, 38 percent of cocaine circulating in the country originates in Peru.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Peru Precursor Seizures Point to Use of Chemical Substitutes. Peru's counternarcotics police have reported the doubling of precursor chemical seizures since 2011, with the substances seized highlighting the use of substitute chemicals to skirt controls imposed on traditional precursors. According to the Anti-drug Directorate of Peru's National Police (Dirandro), more than 2,000 tons of precursor chemicals have been seized this year, which Dirando head Julio Vela Utor said was double the amount seized in 2011, reported Peru21. According to authorities, the increased seizures were the result of improved law enforcement hitting drug production earlier in the chain, demonstrated by the drop in processed cocaine seen over the same period. Among the chemicals seized were calcium hydroxide, calcium oxide, sodium sulfate and sulfuric acid. While the doubling of precursor chemical seizures could point to more effective policing earlier in the chain, it could also indicate growing drug production. Peru overtook Colombia as the major producer of cocaine in 2011 and production is also rising in neighboring Bolivia. Many of the precursor chemicals used to produce drugs in Latin America are imported from Asia, particularly China , with which Peru signed of a Free Trade Agreement in 2009. In the face of stricter controls imposed on traditional precursor chemicals, criminal groups in Latin America have become increasingly resourceful , finding alternative chemicals and often learning to carry out production with materials more readily at hand in the region where they are operating. Of the four chemicals reportedly seized by Peruvian authorities in such large quantities this year, three were identified in a 2012 investigation by Peru's IDL-Reporteros as alternatives for chemicals typically used in cocaine production, or as being used in alternative production methods. One of the dangers of criminal groups using alternative production methods is the possibility of usage of far more potent or unsafe compounds which could pose a danger to users.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Police Announce Record Eco-Trafficking Raid in Mexico. Mexico police announced the results of a three-day raid intended to crack down on wildlife trafficking, reports Reuters. In a nation-wide sweep, police recovered 4,725 wild plants or animals, including rare orchids, parrots, pumas and dozens of other threatened bird and mammal species. Eco-trafficking is one of the most lucrative criminal activities in Latin America: estimates by Interpol say the global trade generates up to $20 billion in profits a year. An NGO in Medellin, known by its Spanish acronym IPC , reports that since 2009, an estimated 2,000 youths have been killed in the city's gang wars, according to Caracol. Murder rates are highest for those aged between 18 and 25. A march against the violence, partly in reaction to the murder of local hip-hop musician Daniel Alejandro Sierra, who died in the city's Comuna 13, is set to take place Tuesday afternoon. The U.S has promised more aid to fight drug trafficking in Central America, reports Prensa Libre. The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Central America and the Caribbean, Julissa Reynoso, met Monday with Guatemalan president Alvaro Colom, and said that the U.S. plans to create a source of aid, known as ""challenge grants,"" that will complement the $200 million in aid already promised by President Barack Obama. According to a report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), written in December 2010 and released last week, an estimated 230,000 people have been displaced in Mexico because of drug violence. Tamaulipas and Chihuahua are thought to be the states most affected, says the report, due to the war between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. "	0	0	1	1	0	1	0
"Venezuela: Where the Traffickers Wear Military Uniforms. In Venezuela the drug traffickers wear camouflage. On the Colombian border, Colombian and Venezuelan guerrillas and the army fight for control of the drug trade. Senior military officers have also been accused of having connections to drug trafficking, but none have been convicted, thanks to their ties to their now deceased commander-in-chief, Hugo Chavez. Juan Guerrero was planning Christmas dinner when his brother Javier de Jesus called. It was late November 2011, and the family had planned to meet outside their house -- a humble brick building with an aluminum roof, in Guasdualito, a small town on the border with Colombia -- to celebrate the holidays. Javier de Jesus, the fifth of 14 children, was the most anticipated visitor. For several years he had lived in hiding as a leader of the Venezuelan guerrilla group known as the Patriotic Forces for National Liberation (Fuerzas Patrioticas de Liberacion Nacional -- FPLN), and he appeared only occasionally. Javier de Jesus had become the commander known as ""Moises Carpio."" This article originally appeared in El Universal Domingo. See original article here. His brother describes him as a serious and sometimes grim person. His peers said he was a leader and extroverted joker who defended farmers. And in Caracas, the capital, experts speak of him and other guerrillas as armed civilians who exert despotic control over their neighbors in the name of serving the Bolivarian revolution, Chavez's quixotic ideology that combined socialism and the region's historic landed elites. His legacy and personality are contradictory, typical of a man who decides to live in the jungle, accumulate weapons and prioritize a cause beyond himself and his family. Juan answered his brother's call as he drove to work. ""They are going to disappear me,"" Javier said calmly to Juan, who listened through the earpiece with resignation. He said nothing. It was the last time he heard the voice of ""Moises."" Throughout Apure, one of Venezuela's most dangerous states due to the presence of guerrillas, the army and drug traffickers, ""Moises"" was famous for defending the Bolivarian revolution by confronting landowners who controlled gasoline, wood, livestock and drug smuggling routes, and by fighting for the expulsion of the Colombian guerrilla groups -- the National Liberation Army (ELN) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) -- whose imposed control over Venezuelan territory he did not accept, though he shared their ideology. He had received threats for a long time. His family begged him to be careful because he had too many enemies. ""Moises"" knew, sooner or later, they would kill him. The soldiers of the battalion assigned to the nearby village of La Victoria, led by Colonel Rafael Angel Saldeno Armas -- a soldier neighbors described as the region's main drug trafficker -- followed his movements for five years. While in countries like Panama and the rest of Central America, drug traffickers steal from each other; in Venezuela the Venezuelan guerrillas take drugs from the military. ""There are generals, colonels, lieutenants and sergeants involved. The drug traffickers can obtain security, transportation, storage, surveillance and military organizational capacity in a place like Venezuela, which for many years was at low risk for drug trafficking,"" said Jose Machillanda, a former soldier and director of the CEPPRO policy research center, a political foundation that promotes social debate. In Guasdualito, it was rumored that Saldeno was obsessed with catching ""Moises."" He was accused of being a ""rustler,"" stealing and smuggling livestock. So Javier de Jesus lived in the jungle, constantly changing his location. He only went into the city occasionally, to visit his family and his ten-year-old son. ""Moises"" joined the Bolivarian revolution during the campaign that carried Hugo Chavez to the presidency in 1999. His goal was to support farmers fighting for their rights, so he joined the Ezequiel Zamora Farmer's Front, which includes 15 percent of the entire country's farmers and ranchers. Apure is primarily a plains region, surrounded by rivers and dominated by landowners. Its inhabitants say that God began creating the world there because of the region's natural beauty and agricultural wealth. However, because of its location on the border, it has also been one of the country's most troubled areas. For many years, farmers were killed and the circumstances of their deaths were never made clear, such as the case of the El Amparo massacre in 1988, when police and soldiers killed 14 fishermen in a confrontation the authorities claimed was against subversive groups. Farmers in the region did not have a right to housing and were subject to widespread labor abuse. ""Moises"" was a primary school teacher who had studied in Cuba and exchanged words for weapons six years ago when he felt the political system would not achieve any change. He chose the most extreme method to defend the principles of Hugo Chavez's government. ""Moises"" had the support of most of the town, which offered him hiding places and food, if necessary. Of all Venezuela's regions, Apure remains one of the most loyal to Chavez's revolution. Chavez himself took refuge in the area after a failed coup in 1992 against then-President Carlos Andres Perez. Jose Luis, the owner of the El Refugio del Conejo restaurant and one of the city's oldest left-wing militants, still keeps photographs from that era, in which he appears alongside a young Chavez, fresh out of prison and extremely thin. The guerrillas emerged in this area to deal with crime that had sprung up on the border decades ago, as a result of the absence of state control. For decades, gasoline smuggling to Colombia, from a country where a tank of gas costs the same as a bottle of water, has been an extremely profitable business. The guerrillas were able to control petty crime. ""Here, you can walk safely at three in the morning. Nobody will rob you. They (the guerrillas) monitor the area at night,"" says a mechanic who has always lived in Guasdualito, and who asked to remain anonymous. But while the cities were calm, more powerful criminal organizations began to establish their presence in the plains. According to acquaintances, ""Moises"" was dedicated to confronting these groups, which were sometimes made up of members of the military itself, or the FARC and ELN. Whenever the Venezuelan guerrillas heard that a car full of drugs, fuel or livestock was due to pass by, they intercepted it and stole the goods to prevent trafficking. What they did after seizing the contraband is a mystery: in Guasdualito they say the contraband remained in the hands of honest officials, but many experts believe that it was used for illegal business dealings. ""We've been through bad times, and the last thing we expected was to fall back on getting funding from drugs. We know that it harms human beings. You should never spit up in the air because it can fall on your face, so we look for any means to avoid having it come to that,"" says a spokesman for the Bolivar and Zamora Revolutionary Current, a leftist organization similar to the guerrillas. Powerful landowners -- many of them retired or active military -- began to notice ""Moises"" and his followers, and pursue them. ""My brother and the farmers were cutting off their illegal merchandise shipments, commandeering land with government permission and many other things. So then they began to persecute my brother, saying he was a smuggler. They ordered his death,"" said Juan Guerrero, a 50-year-old man, dark-haired and strong, with thick eyebrows and a meticulously defined mustache. The guerrillas gave him the name ""Moises"" for the biblical figure Moses, because he led the people, but to his brother, he is still Javier de Jesus. Juan takes a photo of his brother, 11 years younger, from his wallet. ""Everybody says we looked alike,"" he says, months after Christmas, in a hotel lobby. He has carried the photo with him since the last time he spoke with ""Moises"" on that afternoon in late November. Days later, the prophecy announced over the phone was fulfilled. That Christmas, 2011, ""Moises"" did not come to dinner. ***** A woman crosses the border from Colombia with some marijuana in her suitcase. The Venezuelan National Guard order her to stop: - What do you have there? -Cannabis. -Ah Go ahead, go ahead. It's an old joke. Mildred Camero, a judge for 26 years and the former director of the National Commission Against Illicit Drug Use (CONACUID), tells the joke in a Caracas cafe to describe the country's ignorance of drug trafficking when she began her career. Camero, an older woman with platinum blond hair and bright red lipstick, returned to Venezuela in the late 1970s after studying in Europe, certain she wanted to specialize in the fight against drug trafficking. A college friend had died of an overdose. Upon her return, she found a country ""of very, very rich people, who experimented with LSD and marijuana, and very, very poor people, who used crack, though it wasn't as common as it is now."" But the next decade saw the rise of the large cartels in Colombia, and neighboring Venezuela, swimming in oil and filled with luxuries, became an ideal place to transport and store drugs and money. Camero investigated the first case of money laundering in money exchanges on the border. The money ended up in the Banco Cafetero, owned by the legendary Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. They also kept track of the operations of the ""Medellin Cartel"" from Venezuela. ""There in Colombia they pursued them, but here everything was much easier,"" says the former judge. Many of her informants had begun reporting that members of the National Guard were involved in drug trafficking: while they were not running the operations, they would turn a blind eye in exchange for a fee. Two brigadier generals from that group, Ramon Guillen Davila and Orlando Hernandez Villegas, were indicted on charges of drug trafficking. They were finally released in 1993, but they had already left their mark on the popular imagination by giving Venezuela's first cartel its name: the ""Cartel de los Soles,"" (Cartel of the Suns) in reference to the epaulettes military officers wear on their uniforms to signify their rank. The ""go ahead, go ahead"" from the joke became synonymous with corruption. ""Today the biggest problem of drug trafficking in Venezuela is the relationship between the military and drug traffickers,"" says Camero. In 1999, when Hugo Chavez chose her as CONACUID's director, she presented five reports indicting senior military officials. ""But he never read them,"" she laments. For her and other experts there are two events that marked ""the Venezuelan debacle."" The first was Plan Colombia, which began in 2001. The huge amount of money the United States spent to fight drug trafficking in that country caused an exodus of drug traffickers, who took refuge in Venezuela to escape Colombian authorities. Today, in Apure -- a network of small towns connected by a highway that can be covered in two hours -- there are clear signs of the presence of armed rebel groups that share control over the local population. Guasdualito is controlled by the FLPN, as is El Amparo. The towns of San Cristobal, Urena and San Antonio are in the hands of the FARC and the paramilitaries. El Rubio is under the command of the ELN and the paramilitaries, and La Revancha, the ELN. The second turning point that sent the situation in Venezuela into a tailspin was the decision of Hugo Chavez, who died in March, to promote members of the military to powerful positions in government. He increased this trend following the attempted coup against him in 2002, when he decided to surround himself with fellow soldiers who had accompanied him throughout his rise to power. Over the past five years, the US Treasury Department froze assets and bank accounts of four senior officers in the armed forces, a member of the police and two elected representatives for their alleged ties to the FARC and drug trafficking. Hugo Chavez blamed the news on the US government's ""imperialist manipulation."" He never opened an investigation, and, in fact, many of them went on to be promoted. Henry Rangel Silva (pictured above), one of those involved, eventually became Minister of Defense. [Rangel Silva, retired, is now governor of Trujillo state.] Mildred Camero's judicial career ended in 2005, when she was dismissed from office in the same year that the Venezuelan government expelled the US counter drug agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and other anti-drug entities from the country. She says a large number of her investigations pointed toward the involvement of ever more high ranking military officials. Her conclusions depicted them as brokers for the FARC, exchanging drugs and money for weapons. When she confirmed these suspicions, an alarmed Camero went to the office of Vice-president Jose Vicente Rangel, also a former Minister of Defense and former Minister of Foreign Affairs: ""Look, vice president, this is what is happening,"" said Camero. ""Wow, you've got balls,"" he responded. According to Camero's version of the story, Rangel grabbed the papers, crumpled them into a ball and threw them away. The former judge still has a lawsuit pending against her for treason. In her safe, she jealously guards reports that, she says, incriminate several important figures from Chavez's administration. She calls them her best life insurance policy. ***** An Air France flight that had departed from Caracas was seized in Paris on September 13 carrying more than 30 suitcases full of cocaine. Two weeks ago, five policemen were sentenced to 26 years in prison for drug trafficking. Last year, a small plane with 1.5 tons of drugs left from the La Carlota military base. The vast majority of aircraft seized in Honduras are registered in Venezuela. In 2012, the government destroyed more than 100 clandestine airstrips in the country. Until three years ago, Walid Makled, Venezuela's most famous drug trafficker, who owned the airline Aeropostal and a large portion of Puerto Cabello -- the most important seaport in the country -- managed to send up to five tons of drugs from Maiquetia International Airport to Ciudad del Carmen, in Tabasco. People say he was able to do it was thanks to his connections with ""The Federation,"" a consortium of the cartels run by Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman and Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada. At some point in the last decade the news about Venezuela and its role in international drug trafficking began to flood newspapers. So much so that, earlier this month the former president of the National Drug Commission, Bayardo Ramirez, declared that Venezuela was ""the number one drug trafficker in Latin America."" Regarding that analysis, Hernan Matute, one of the country's leading researchers on security and drug trafficking, said: ""Now it's normal to see overseas seizures of shipments that left from Venezuela, the destructions of drug production laboratories -- something that was unthinkable 10 years ago -- or the discovery of marijuana and opium crops in the border areas. Also, precursor chemicals under the strict control of the Venezuelan state are being used in processing cocaine, and the US Treasury Department continues to make accusations and find links between Venezuelan politicians, members of the military and bankers, and drug trafficking. "" When Walid Makled, better known as ""The Turk,"" was arrested in Colombia, he was asked how he had been able to bypass airport security and send drugs abroad. He replied, ""Do you think you can transport 500 bags of cocaine without help?"" Venezuela fought Colombia for Makled's immediate extradition. In an interview with RCN, a leading Colombian television channel, the dealer said he had a list of all the people within the Chavez government that he paid in order to continue operating, but since he was extradited he hasn't spoken of it again. ""The clearest example of narco-militarism is Makled,"" says Jose Machillanda, the CEPPRO director. ""The case explains how he had exclusive access to petrochemical products, an airline with international flights, a port, how he supported Chavez's government and how he supported regional governments and told the governors what to do."" A while after Makled's capture, Eladio Aponte, a soldier and judge in the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, was removed from his office, fled to Costa Rica and requested DEA protection. The former judge confessed that on several occasions he received direct orders from Miraflores Palace [the presidential office] to free members of the military involved in drug trafficking. This political pollution that has plagued the Venezuelan government in recent years reaches all the way to the border. The former governor of Apure, Jesus Aguilarte, was forced to resign in 2011 by the Chavez administration itself as a result of mismanagement. Last year, he was killed in a McDonalds in the city of Maracay. In another restaurant, a couple of months later, a man approached a couple sitting at a table and asked, 'Are you General Moreno?' After the man answered, 'Yes,' the stranger pulled out a gun and killed him. His full name was Wilmer Antonio Moreno, a soldier and Chavez supporter since 1992. Later, it was discovered that both men had links to drug trafficking. ""They're burning all of those files,"" says Roberto Briceno, director of the Venezuelan Violence Observatory, an institution that publishes studies on violence and corruption in the country. ""Aponte left because of this, because he knows a lot."" In Apure, says Briceno, drugs enter from the Colombian Amazon and are then transported through Puerto Cabello or Sucre en route to Honduras. ""The connection between drugs, government and military is so strong that there is no real anti-drug policy,"" Briceno says. ***** The next time Juan had contact with his brother was in the Guasdualito morgue, a few days after that last call. The medical examiner showed him the body so he could identify him. Juan then asked him to show him the wounds. The commander ""Moises"" had a dent in his skull from a blow inflicted with a rifle butt; raw wrists that showed signs of having been tied up and dragged; bruises and scratches over his entire body; and four bullet wounds in his chest. The official report sent to Caracas described an altercation between the army and several thieves. ""But it was not a confrontation, they tortured him, it was a massacre,"" says Juan in front of his brother's grave, a simple tombstone, decorated with two bouquets of flowers that have been drying in the city's humid heat. Three other fighters share the cemetery with their commander, one of them in a crude grave with no name. The family was so poor that they could not provide anything for a more dignified burial. Near the cemetery there is graffiti that agree with Juan's version of the story: ""Saldeno murderer,"" ""Smuggler,"" ""They are not rustlers they are revolutionaries."" In Guasdualito, although authorities disagree, the people are convinced that Saldeno, the soldier they accused of being the area's largest dealer, settled a score. Twenty days before being gunned down, ""Moises"" and his unit received reports that a group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Saldeno were transporting four barrels of contraband: two of cocaine, one with Colombian pesos and another full of dollars. The guerrillas attacked them and stole the goods. This was when Javier de Jesus called his brother and told him they were going to kill him. The morning of November 24, he disappeared. The night before, commander ""Moises"" and his men arrived at Bocas del Rio Viejo, a rural area about an hour and a half from Guasdualito, which can only be accessed by river in small boats. They stayed at a neighbor's house in the area, with a man known as ""The Devil,"" who lived with his wife and 15-year-old son. They had dinner and went to sleep. The next morning ""Moises"" had to oversee a meeting with some farmers. According to the survivors' story, at five o'clock in the morning a group of men in civilian clothing, equipped with night vision and rifles, attacked the house. The next day they arrived in Guasdualito with four bodies, including that of ""Moises."" Two other fighters were wounded; so were ""The Devil,"" his wife and his son, who had his hand crushed. ""They were saved because the boy clung to his mother,"" says Juan, who says that there were two other guerrillas who were thrown into the river. The Ministry of Defense statement published after ""Moises'"" death was proud of the work of the Armed Forces, ""the permanent guarantor of national sovereignty, ever more connected to the Venezuelan people, organized, prepared, trained and well-equipped."" Months later, Saldeno was relieved of his duty and sent to Caracas. So far he hasn't been tried, not for drug trafficking or for the murder of ""Moises"" and his companions. Graffiti in the city says: ""Cursed is the soldier who shoots at his people."" We asked Juan to make some calls to visit Bocas del Rio Viejo. Although he has never belonged to any armed group, everyone in town knows each other, and it is not difficult to contact someone who knows the area. He promised to do so and we said goodbye until the morning. The next day we met in the hotel lobby. He brought bad news. ""They told me it is impossible. Right now it is very dangerous. Yesterday they heard gunshots,"" he explained. ""The fighting there has started again."" * Jose Luis Pardo and Alejandra S.

"3 Reasons Why the Monos Trial in Argentina Matters. The trial of more than 30 members of Argentina's most notorious and violent criminal organization, the Monos, on drug trafficking charges is likely to mark a milestone in the fight against organized crime, but it will take more than just the courts to break the group's tight grip on power. On September 20, 39 individuals will stand trial in a federal court in the city of Rosario for crimes ranging from organizing and producing drugs to packing and selling them as part of the infamous Monos criminal organization, reported La Capital. The Monos, led by members of the powerful Cantero family, is one of the most infamous criminal organizations in Argentina. They mostly control drug trafficking in Rosario, a strategic port city situated on the Parana River that acts as a transit point for drug shipments coming from neighboring Bolivia and Paraguay. Around a dozen of the accused standing trial are members of the Cantero family, some of whose members are already behind bars serving time for racketeering and murder charges , in addition to allegedly being part of an illicit organization. This is the first time high-level members of the criminal organization will face justice on drug trafficking charges in Rosario, which is a federal crime in Argentina. Here are three reasons why this trial is key for the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime in the South American nation: 1. Argentina Might be Serious About Tackling Organized Crime The fact that authorities in Argentina decided to go ahead with the trial despite the wave of violence the Monos has unveiled in Rosario -- media outlets reported 14 violent attacks against judges, prosecutors and witnesses since May -- says a lot about how serious they are about stopping the criminal organization. Judges involved in the trial have publicly expressed their fears over possible attacks during the trial. But in a country where justice is notorious for being slow, prosecutors seem determined to see the Canteros behind bars. Local media outlets reported that national authorities are implementing an unprecedented level of security for the groundbreaking trial. Militarized police will join local police forces in the court building and 22 of the accused will only participate in the trial via video link. 2. Justice as a Crime Fighting Tool Using the justice system and not just security forces to tackle organized crime is a promising strategy that could prove effective in the mid- to long-term. This is the first time high-level members of one of the most powerful and violent criminal organizations in Argentina will face federal drug trafficking charges in Rosario. The trial is the result of a lengthy investigation dubbed ""Los Patrones,"" which started in 2014 and unveiled an intricate drug production and distribution network, primarily through evidence obtained from wiretaps, involving dozens of individuals. The fact that authorities have invested so much time and resources, and have also had enough will to follow through with the case until charges were presented and trials were conducted, might act as a deterrent to other, less powerful groups who might see their actions might have consequences. 3. Justice Alone is Not Enough As strong as the trial may seem, the fact that the weight of the evidence against the Monos members is the result of wiretaps that showed the group's leaders -- Maximo ""Guille"" Cantero and Jorge Emanuel ""Ema"" Chamorro -- managed the organization from prison, while their partners -- Vanesa Barrios and Jesica Lloan -- led activities from the outside speaks to the levels of corruption within Argentina's prison system. That, coupled with the fact that nine police officers have already been sentenced to prison time for colluding with the criminal group, shows that unless deep-seated corruption within security forces and prison authorities is tackled, any progress achieved through the courts will have little impact."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Readies for 2016 Domestic Drug Policy Debate. Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto has reiterated his disapproval of legalizing marijuana in the country, setting the tables for a debate that could set a key precedent in drug policies throughout Latin America. ""I have clearly and categorically expressed my personal position on several occasions: I am not in favor of consumption or legalization of marijuana,"" the president affirmed during the inauguration of a new child welfare program on December 2, reported Proceso. Pena Nieto's comments came the same day that Mexico's Interior Minister, Miguel Angel Osorio Chong, announced marijuana laws will be reviewed in a three-pronged debate beginning in January 2016. This will include forums with experts, academics, and the public, and the analysis of similar experiences in other countries. In his remarks, Pena Nieto maintained that legalization would not help in the fight against drug trafficking, and questioned whether fighting crime was worth putting children's health at risk. The president used a personal anecdote to enforce his point, describing how his children approached him and his wife asking, ""does that mean I can light up a joint in front of you soon?"" Pena Nieto added that he was nevertheless in favor of a debate exploring the possible uses of marijuana, including for medical purposes. This is not the first time Pena Nieto has explicitly rejected marijuana legalization, saying in early November he believes marijuana is a gateway drug to more harmful substances. This came days after Mexico's Supreme Court opened the door to possible legalization when it allowed four individuals to grow and own marijuana for personal consumption. It is currently illegal to produce and sell marijuana for commercial purposes in Mexico, although recreational drug consumption and the possession of less than five grams of marijuana was decriminalized in 2009. Mexico's next steps regarding marijuana legalization could reverberate throughout the Americas. The stage is now set for a 2016 drug debate between Mexico's courts and the Pena Nieto administration, with the two sides currently at odds over drug policy -- although Pena Nieto has stated he will respect the Supreme Court's recent ruling. Popular opinion, however, appears to favor the administration. A recent survey by El Universal revealed 66 percent of respondents opposed marijuana legalization, although 63 percent support a debate on the issue. How this debate plays out in Mexico may influence the wider regional drug policy discussion. For instance, Colombia is looking to legalize the medical or scientific use of marijuana, and Brazil has been considering the decriminalization of certain drugs -- mirroring policies that already exist in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Venezuela. Although Uruguay set a precedent in 2013 when it legalized the production and consumption of marijuana, Mexico is a much larger country with a crucial and highly publicized role in the war against drugs. Indeed, if Mexico takes steps to further liberalize its drug policy, it may encourage other nations in the region to more seriously consider doing the same. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Venezuela Announces Plan to Combat Rampant Kidnapping. Venezuela's interior ministry has announced a new plan to combat kidnapping in the country, but it's doubtful the strategy will slow the country's steep rise in abductions for ransom. Interior Minister Nestor Reverol, who was appointed to the cabinet position in early August by President Nicolas Maduro one day after the US government indicted him on drug charges, announced the launch of the National Plan against Kidnapping on September 23, reported Panorama. The plan includes a new maximum security facility where alleged kidnappers will be held in preventive detention while awaiting trial. The authorities also intend to block cell phone signals from entering the country's prisons in order to cut down on inmates coordinating kidnappings from behind bars. The interior minister said authorities will also create a special unit to attend to victims, which includes a 24-hour hotline to report kidnappings. The plan will first be implemented in the states of Miranda, Carabobo, Zulia, Aragua and the Capital District, reported EFE. According to Reverol, more than half of all kidnappings are registered in Miranda. There is little doubt that kidnapping is a major problem in Venezuela, which is suffering from a wider breakdown in law and order amid a worsening economic crisis. There are no reliable statistics on how widespread kidnapping is, as these cases often go unreported and the Venezuelan government's crime data is notoriously suspect. One recent study, however, which was based on citizen perceptions and anecdotal evidence, suggested the number of kidnappings rose by 170 percent during the first semester of 2016. InSight Crime field research conducted in 2011 found that many people in the capital city of Caracas knew someone who had been a kidnapping victim. The most common form of the crime is known as express kidnapping, in which the hostage is held for less than 48 hours. Whether the government's new plan will in fact reduce the number of kidnappings is much less certain. The primordial issue facing any government initiative to combat crime in Venezuela is corruption; rather than disbanding kidnapping rings, police officers are often the ones running the illegal networks. The government's flagship citizen security operation, known as the OLP, has also been marred by allegations of widespread human rights abuses.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"How UberEATS Could Reduce Violence in Mexico City. The dismantling of a microtrafficking operation in Mexico City that used bags issued by UberEATS to deliver marijuana shows how dealers are using new, and, analysts say, less violent ways to distribute drugs. At least ten people were arrested by police in the working class neighbourhood of Tepito on May 30, in possession of a number of bags of marijuana packed into the UberEATS backpacks, according to news reports. The police also found several muffins, presumably also containing marijuana, which had been packed for delivery. UberEATS backpacks have become common in the upscale neighborhoods of the city, where the service has become popular. It provides home delivery for customers of food sourced from restaurants that do not always provide takeout services. In response to the arrests, Uber -- which also runs the highly popular mobile telephone-car service in Mexico City -- issued the following statement to the Mexican press : ""Uber condemns all acts that are a risk to people's health or security."" It added that it would cooperate with the authorities in their investigation. The use of door-to-door delivery services such as that furnished by UberEATS service might actually help reduce the violence usually associated with microtrafficking. Tepito is Mexico City's most emblematic 'barrio bravo ,' or tough neighborhood. It is a hub for crimes such as counterfeiting, drug processing and sales, as well as arms trafficking. It is also home to the famous Santa Muerte shrine. Violence here is common and ever-present. By creating steps of separation between buyers and sellers drug dealers maintain a lower profile and a more discreet distribution network. ""All things being equal, more discreet and decentralized distribution equals less violence,"" Alejandro Hope, a crime analyst and former intelligence official,* told InSight Crime. If clients can order their drugs via the phone or messaging services and have them delivered to their door, it means a lot less waiting around and exposure for both sides of the transaction. ""For sure, home-delivery services tend to be much less violent than open-air markets (people standing in corners) and other forms of retail drug selling, like club dealers and the like,"" said Jaime Lopez, a security policy consultant and former police official. ""Obviously, the best alternative is a well-regulated legal market, but in terms of violence, delivery beats other illegal alternatives."" *Hope is also part of InSight Crime's Board of Directors ."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Port Town in Bloody Battle Over Former FARC Turf. At least four criminal groups are apparently running the illegal economies in the port of Tumaco on Colombia's Pacific coast, which is resulting in homicides and mass community displacement. As the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) rebels gather in pre-concentration and official concentration zones where they will demobilize and prepare for their transition into society, they are relinquishing territorial control within the capital of Narino department, Tumaco. This has precipitated a bloody battle between various criminal organizations over the guerrillas' former turf. *This article was translated, edited for clarity and length and published with the permission of Verdad Abierta. It does not necessarily represent the views of InSight Crime. See the Spanish original here. Illegal armed groups like the so-called Gaitanista Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia - AGC, also known as the ""Urabenos"") and National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) guerrillas are arriving in areas where rebels from the FARC's 8th and 29th Fronts, and the Daniel Aldana and Mariscal Antonio Jose de Sucre Mobile Columns, had previously operated.** Local groups are also appearing, putting the civilian population at risk; this was seen recently in the mass displacement that occurred on January 5 in the Pital de Costa area, in the northern part of Tumaco. ""Thirty armed men in camouflage arrived at night,"" a human rights defender who requested anonymity said. ""They held a meeting with the community to say that they were going to control the zone and drug trafficking in the area."" The reaction of many local inhabitants was to flee to the urban capital and to the neighboring municipalities of Mosquera and Francisco Pizarro, according to a report from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations (Oficina para la Coordinacion de Asuntos Humanitarios de la ONU - OCHA). The Municipal Ombudsman's Office (Personeria) of Tumaco reported 142 families displaced to the municipal capital and another 27 to the municipality of Mosquera. The human rights defender interviewed by Verdad Abierta said that although the numbers are unknown, people also sought refuge in the localities of Playa San Juan, Guachal de la Costa (in Tumaco), Cocal Jimenez, Cocal Payan, Tasquita (in Mosquera) and Satinga (in Olaya Herrera). Local Ombudsman Amy Castillo confirmed that dozens of people who arrived to the urban center were given food and accommodation assistance by the mayor's office. However, the official acknowledged that the municipality did not have the resources to tend to all of those displaced for the three months required by law, and while the Victims Unit (Unidad de Victimas) registers them. Faced with these obstacles, they are requesting help from NGOs and the local and national governments. SEE ALSO : Colombia News and Profiles ""We began [last week] with the delivery of humanitarian aid, which consisted of food supplies for 15 days, jointly delivered with institutions who will support us in mitigating the humanitarian situation,"" Tumaco Government Secretary Edwin Palma explained to local media regarding how the mayor's office was addressing the situation. ""Another measure we're taking is defining a lease agreement so these families can stay in more dignified conditions in Tumaco, and here we are."" ""More than 100 people stayed in Pital and today they are left with nothing to eat,"" the human rights defender told Verdad Abierta. ""The few shopkeepers who were there left, and the people are afraid to go to work in the fields because they might be confronted by armed groups."" OCHA also reported this confinement and expressed that the population fears retaliation from the illegal armed groups that now dominate the area. Meanwhile, according to Castillo, officials from state entities are waiting for a National Police dispatch in order to enter the village and tend to the residents. Verdad Abierta contacted the chief of police in Tumaco, Col. Carlos Castellanos, to discuss the matter. Initially, he said he was in a security meeting, and at the time of publishing had not responded to requests for comment. State Vacuum Beyond the problem of humanitarian aid lies the question of whether or not the state has the capacity to occupy territories left behind by the FARC in the long term. For many community leaders, as well as for the municipal ombudsman, it's clear that these violent acts are related to the issue. ""It's no secret that, in these remote areas, the power over social guidelines belongs directly to the FARC,"" Castillo said. ""As they left, this created a void that the state did not have the capacity to fill. So the groups with a criminal past and certain ties to organized armed groups, including the guerrillas, saw an opportunity to strengthen themselves and take over drug trafficking."" The conflict over illegal economies in Pital de la Costa is nothing new. The local ombudsman explained that it has been a strategic zone in the armed conflict because it offers sea and river navigation and is close to Ecuador, but is still sufficiently distant from the municipal capital -- at least three hours away by boat. Sources consulted by Verdad Abierta claimed that paramilitaries from the Libertadores del Sur Bloc came in the year 2000 to take control of the profitable cocaine trafficking business. A couple of years after their demobilization, in 2005, the illegal armed group known as ""Los Rastrojos,"" lead by Nulver Sarria Garcia, alias ""Apache 5,"" and Iller Numar Trujillo Diaz, alias ""Apache 4,"" took over Pital de la Costa. This faction of ""Los Rastrojos"" was expelled in 2011 by the Daniel Aldana Front of the FARC, which have since exercised control over the area, at least until mid-2016. At this point, the insurgent known as ""Don Y"" rejected the peace process and seized some strategic points in north Tumaco. However, the dissidence of ""Don Y"" meant his death. He was assassinated on November 12, 2016, in the rural locality San Pedro del Vino, Francisco Pizarro municipality. One month later, the FARC assumed responsibility for his death, according to a statement by the monitoring team attached to the peace process. Armed and Unknown The threat posed by the presence of new illegal groups and their constant battle to gain control of the port town of Tumaco resulted in three more mass displacements over the last year: two in mid-February 2016 in the localities of Bajo Jagua and Alto Jagua, and another in December in the locality of Teheran. A total of 220 families were displaced, according to data from the Ombudsman's Office. A homicide rate of 70 per 100,000 inhabitants is more evidence of the critical humanitarian situation and public security turmoil in the municipality. This is an alarming figure when considering that the national homicide rate is 25 per 100,000, according to Defense Ministry data. In the first two weeks of this year there were seven homicides, four more than during the same period in 2016. The situation has worsened in recent months. In addition to the ELN's interest in controlling certain zones abandoned by the FARC, the AGC have been intending to consolidate their presence in Tumaco since the year 2015. But they are not the only ones. ""Some people who allegedly belonged to the demobilized United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC) [paramilitary organization], the Rastrojos and/or the Aguilas Negras [criminal organizations]"" could be forming new groups to take possession of drug trafficking routes and other illegal economies. The Early Warning System (Sistema de Alertas Tempranas - SAT) of the Ombudsman's Office announced this on November 8, in a document accessed by Verdad Abierta. As if all of these groups weren't sufficient enough to destabilize security in Tumaco, the Public Ministry added that there are also some guerrillas (presumably militiamen and fighters) who do not want to join the peace process. They hope to form new structures to continue running illegal economies and control strategic territories and populations. For their part, FARC guerrillas gathered at the pre-concentration area in El Playon have issued two announcements recently in which they denounced the presence of alleged paramilitaries in the vicinity of the zone, who are supposedly under the command of three men known by the aliases ""Cusumbo,"" ""Olindillo"" and ""Titano."" ""Another group of 40 paramilitaries from the 'Urabenos' are located in the area of El Seivito, five minutes from the Tumaco-Pasto road and near the military base of Chilvi,"" the FARC said in their announcement. ""Another paramilitary group going by the name of 'Los Negritos,' and made up of some 30 men, can be found in the area of El DescolgaderoThey dress as civilians and in camouflage, and carry short and long firearms."" In March 2016, a pamphlet signed by Los Negritos appeared threatening members of the Tumaco Victims Committee (Mesa de Victimas de Tumaco), the Ombudsman's Office's SAT found. Three months later, another anonymous pamphlet circulated in Llorente, but this time it was signed by the so-called ""Assassins Organization of the Pacific"" (""Organizacion Sicarial del Pacifico"") warning of a ""social cleansing"" process. And on August 3, a group going by the name of ""The People of Order"" (""La Gente del Orden"") threatened anyone collaborating with other illegal armed organizations in the Puente del Pindo area, in the municipal capital. All of these criminal groups appeared to fight for control of drug trafficking routes and revenues from illegal gold mining, sexual exploitation and oil theft from the Transandino pipeline, which runs through the municipality. With the FARC now gathered and on the path to legality, ""the de facto authority that regulated those types of 'situations'"" has been lost, the Ombudsman's Office admitted. SEE ALSO : Colombia News and Profiles Such is the extent of insecurity in the area, that since January 17 threats against the local police stations have been circulating on WhatsApp. In an internal police memo seen by Verdad Abierta, the security institution even asks the station commanders to provide ""safety recommendations to the personnel under their authority"" because they fear being ""the target of an attack,"" such as an explosive device being launched against the officers. Facing the greatest risk is the La Espriella station, located on the Tumaco-Pasto highway, by the areas of Chilvi, Llorente and La Guayacana, according to the document. It is therefore little surprise that the community leaders of Tumaco are crying out for their local, departmental and national governments to establish a presence throughout the port town to counter the criminal groups striving to take over the territory with brute force. ""The issue is that if the government does not make these areas a priority, filling those gaps with the public security forces will be very difficult, and regions such as Tumaco will be worse off after the conflict,"" a local leader who requested anonymity said. Verdad Abierta tried many times to reach Carlos Correa, high councilor to the president for the regions, and Edwin Palma, the government secretary for Tumaco, to know their position on the institutional presence. They did not respond. *This article was translated, edited for clarity and length and published with the permission of Verdad Abierta. It does not necessarily represent the views of InSight Crime.

"Honduras Police Respond to InSight Crime Firearms Trafficking Investigation. As congress debates new legislation regarding firearms, authorities in Honduras have publicly responded to the recent publication of an InSight Crime investigation on firearms trafficking in the country, outlining some of the steps they are taking to improve their weapons control efforts.* In a press release dated August 30, the Honduran National Police addressed several points raised by InSight Crime's recent investigation , which highlighted the role firearms play in Honduras' high levels of violence and crime. One issue clarified by the press release is the number of legal weapons recorded by the National Firearms Registry (Registro Nacional de Armas - RNA). According to the police, the RNA has a database of 159,928 legally registered arms as of July 30. When InSight Crime and our partner, the Association for a More Just Society (Asociacion para una Sociedad mas Justa - ASJ), visited the RNA office in May 2015, ""the head of the RNA was unable to produce an exact count"" of the number of weapons registered by the agency, ""saying only that his office had registered 'about 550,000' weapons."" However, when we followed up with the Security Ministry in May 2017, the ministry's communications director told us that the government had registered 325,000 weapons. According to the press release, the RNA is ""fulfilling its duties in the center, north, and south of the country, and soon will open a new office on the Atlantic coast."" The police also addressed the issue of the Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS), which is used to compare firearms ballistics data for criminal forensic investigations. InSight Crime's investigation found problems with the way the system was being used, including incidents where authorities were ""incorrectly registering the ballistics fingerprints of bullet samples, which cost them nearly eight years of data."" Moreover, we reported that the police had allowed their license for the IBIS system to lapse during our investigation, meaning ""they frequently could not access the centralized database and upload the new microscopic images they had captured."" We requested information about whether the license was renewed, but did not receive a response. Now, the police say that the IBIS system is ""functioning in an efficient manner,"" with more than 53,000 ballistic signatures currently available for comparison. The press release adds that beginning in January 2018, the police will be able to use the IBIS system to produce expert forensic reports, counting on the work of ""ballistics researchers trained abroad who will be able to execute these delicate functions."" The police also addressed InSight Crime's reporting about various amnesties offered by the government ""that allow those with illegal weapons to register them with the authorities without facing sanctions."" Our investigation showed that this lengthy and complicated process often contributes to citizens' decisions to avoid purchasing or registering their firearms through legal channels. The press release does not necessarily dispute these conclusions, but it does say that the amnesties have been carried out in a transparent and rigorous manner. (See the original press release below.) The Honduran congress is currently considering a legislative proposal to establish new classes of firearms licenses -- one for home firearm possession and another for carrying firearms in public -- as well as to restrict gun ownership to one firearm per person. While InSight Crime's investigation found that Honduran authorities face many serious challenges in their efforts to control the flow of illicit firearms both into and within the country, the National Police's response shows that the institution is attempting to address some of these issues. As we wrote in our investigation, ""contradictory legal statutes, corruption, malfeasance and bureaucracy fuel the local black market in Honduras."" These issues will not be easy to fix, and will require sustained and serious efforts to reform deeply flawed systems and practices relating to investigations into firearms trafficking, as well as the use of these weapons in criminal activities. Addressing issues related to the databases used to track the hundreds of thousands of guns circulating in the country would be a positive first step. * This article has been updated to reflect that Honduran lawmakers are currently considering a legislative proposal related to firearms."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
US Navy Testing Drones to Track Caribbean Drug Trafficking. The US Navy has begun testing new aerial equipment to detect and monitor drug trafficking in the Caribbean, an example of the technological advances being employed in regional crime fighting. As the Associated Press reported , the equipment includes large blimps equipped with cameras and sensors that can detect and identify ships from up to 50 miles away, as well as unmanned aircraft known as drones, meant to obtain photos and video of suspicious vessels spotted by the blimp. The technology has been extensively used by US Customs and Border Protection and the military, but never before by the Navy. Rear Admiral Sinclair Harris, commander of the Navy's Fourth Fleet, said that the devices would be used to compensate for a series of budget cuts, which will limit the number of US Navy ships on patrol in the Caribbean. Drones have been employed in the fight against drug trafficking by the US for a number of years, with the first known testing of such a device taking place off the coast of El Salvador in 2009. Various Latin American countries have followed suit. Drones have not only been employed to catch drug traffickers , but have been used to monitor criminal activity in Rio de Janeiro's favelas , the illegal exploitation of natural resources in remote parts of Brazil, and the energy infrastructure targeted by left-wing rebels in Colombia's conflict. The camera-equipped blimps, also known as aerostats, is a newer development, first tested last August along the Mexico-US border. As reported by InSight Crime , the use of the aerostats is an attempt to recycle equipment from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, where the devices were used for surveillance around military bases. They are much cheaper to operate than drones, and thus may prove to be a useful tool for US security institutions -- including the Navy -- operating under a more constrained budget.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Whats Behind Grenade Attacks Against Venezuela Police?Over 100 police officers have been killed just in Caracas so far in 2015. However, in the last week of September violence against police officers in Venezuela took on new dimensions with five grenade attacks in three days. The most brazen was an attack on the Baruta Municipal Police in eastern Caracas when men on motorcycles threw two grenades at a temporary checkpoint (""alcabala"") injuring eight officers and four civilians. There were also against the headquarters of the investigation police CICPC near Caracas, a station of the Guarico State police, and a station of the Miranda State police. News portal EfectoCocuyo.com has counted at least 27 ""incidents involving the use of grenades"" since January this year. This article was originally published by Venezuela Politics and Human Rights and is reposted with permission. See the original here. On September 30 Attorney General, Luisa Ortega Diaz, said that her office is investigating the attacks and focusing on the origin of the explosives since the hand grenades are believed to have been obtained Armed Forces ammunition depots. Opposition leader Capriles Radonski has publically asked the Minister of Defense, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, to explain how it is possible that hand grenades, supposed to be in the sole possession of the armed forces, are finding their way to the hands of private citizens on the streets. Police officials have speculated that the attacks have to do with the apparent injury or death of Jose Antonio Tovar ""El Picure"" a criminal gang leader shortly before the attacks. Tovar's band is known to have been behind a grenade attack on July 5 against a police station in Aragua State. Indeed the government is arguing that these attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Operacion Liberacion del Pueblo. National Assembly Deputy Fredy Bernal said because they are being hit hard ""criminal organizations have given the order to attack against police forces."" When President Nicolas Maduro returned from the United National General Assembly he said the attacks were acts of right-wing terrorism. ""While I was away in New York, defending peace and the sovereignty of Venezuela, the right went crazy."""	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexicos Military Follow Their Own Rules in the Drug War. Several incidents in the last few weeks have raised additional doubts over how Mexico's soldiers are approaching the so-called ""drug war."" Not only are there questions over how appropriately the security forces react in confrontations with civilians, but the importance of the military itself in Mexico's democracy may yet come under scrutiny. Recently, various members of the military ( including a lieutenant colonel ) were detained in Zacatecas, a key state in the drug trade, as it borders Durango and has a movement corridor connecting it to Jalisco. The military detainees are accussed of the extrajudicial killing of seven people. Public pressure lead to an unusually speedy reaction, with the military itself acknowledging that there are signs that a crime took place. Meanwhile, in the conflicted state of Michoacan , several individuals have accused the military of killing a minor and another five people injured. This allegedly took place during the military's attempt to break up a road block in Ostula. Roads have become a symbolic battle site for the state's self-defense groups in their fight against the Knights Templar; in this case, the road block was spurred by the arrest of an indigenous leader for illegal weapons possession. Military commanders have denied that they opened fire on the crowd, and have blamed a group of armed civilians. These examples follow what is widely known as the Tlatlaya massacre, in which the Mexican military illegally executed 22 people, according to affirmations by the primary witness in the case. A report by human rights organization Prodh suggests that sectors of the Mexican armed forces signed off on orders to execute those they dubbed criminals. To be sure, this case illustrates how Mexico has moved beyond the simple militarization of the war against drug trafficking - a trend seen across the region and made especially evident in Mexico. What Mexico is now seeing is soldiers creating -- and acting on -- their own manual for appropriate use of force. It's worth recalling the military has been deployed across the country in this way due to the shortcomings of the federal police. And there have been some calls from within the armed forces (mainly from General Salvador Cienfuegos , the Secretariat of National Defense) that the government do a better job supervising the military's ""civilian"" tasks. But in turn, the military has also presented itself as an actor that must follow its own rules -- rules that are too difficult for anyone else outside the military to supervise, given Mexico's opaque policies when it comes to use of violence. How was Mexico's military incentivized to follow a policy of excessive force? How was Mexico's military incentivized to follow a policy of excessive force ? In some ways, every case is different. In Ostula, for example, the military's alleged disproportionate reaction may have something to do with the lingering conflict between self-defense groups and the Knights Templar. And making the situation even more volatile are the civilians who refuse to disarm, given that organized crime still persists in the region. In Zacatecas and Tlatlaya, it is more of a matter of determining whether there is something systematic behind the military's actions. This is a particularly worrying possibility. If you don't define such incidents of excessive force as either anomalies, or the result of military authorities not paying enough attention, then you are left with something that could very well be described as a crime against humanity. In judicial terms , it would be tough to pull together enough evidence showing that an international human rights crime took place. However, added together, all these incidents are enough to warrant serious questions whether these apparently unrelated incidents of excessive force have some kind of connection. In that sense, if human rights activists wanted to put a successful case together, they would have to look for disctricts where other military abuses took place -- murders, torture, and illegal detentions. Those looking to prove systematic military abuse would not be able to rely on sample cases in which the exact role of the military was unclear. Such is the case with Ayotzinapa, in which 43 students disappeared, and involved an especially complex relationship between municipal institutions and criminal groups. Mexico's military has become the autonomous, powerful institution it is today due to the lack of controls that the military itself exercises over its own security agenda. However, we can more clearly see a systematic pattern of military abuse, when looking at what several human rights organizations denounced between 2006 to 2013 in the Baja California peninsula. The cases denounced in this region and Tlatlaya have a key thing in common: both involved security forces wanting to demonstrate progress in the fight against drug trafficking, via their use of violence. (It's a similar variable that has been observed in Colombia's ""false positive"" cases ). The Zacatecas incident could also fall within these parameters, given the profile of the victims there. Going beyond the judicial question of proving whether there is systematic abuse taking place or not, the larger issue is what is the military's role in Mexico's democracy. Usually, this debate highlights that the military is something like the last option for civilians, given the incompetence of the federal police. Nevertheless, we could take a different point of view. Mexico's military has become the autonomous, powerful institution it is today due to the lack of controls that the military itself exercises over its own security agenda. To be sure, the military command are not the ones who made the political decision to militarize the fight against drug trafficking. However, it is also clear the military has become the institution that sets the tone when it comes to Mexico's drug policy. And this has led to unexpected results -- such as the creation of certain incentives that end up weakening the state. There are some other obvious examples of this, including the debate over limiting human rights cases to military courts. There is another larger challenge to be faced here. With such high impunity rates, Mexico could be incapable to processing cases like Tlatlaya with the speed and scruntiny that victims deserve. This limitation could justify getting the International Criminal Court involved. Without institutions like Guatemala's controversial United Nation anti-impunty commission, and without units that thoroughly investigate the most problematic cases of violence (as seen with Colombia's Attorney General's Office ), Mexico's institutions are not equipped to deal with cases that involve systematic violence. Only a wider investigation would reveal whether there is truly evidence of abuses committed at a larger scale in Mexico. However, there is increasing evidence that within this unconventional conflict, the security forces will act as though they are pursuing a counter-insurgency campaign. And meanwhile, civilian powers -- regardless of their position within the government -- remain incapable of creating new paradigms to avoid the repetition of violence.

"Brazil Ex-President Detained for Questioning in Petrobras Investigation. Brazil's former president has been detained for questioning as part of an ongoing inquiry into the Petrobras corruption scandal that is sweeping the country. Federal Police raided the home of ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on March 4, and the former head of state was detained for questioning, reported the BBC. The search warrant served on da Silva's home was one of the more than 30 being served simultaneously by federal authorities across the country in connection to bribery and money laundering investigations stemming from the wide-ranging Petrobras Scandal. The foundation offices of Da Silva -- who is popuarly known in the country as ""Lula"" -- were also raided in Sao Paulo. Although detained, the former president was not arrested or charged with a crime, and he has since been released. However, authorities have noted that the investigation is not closed. Police officials say they have evidence connecting Lula to the Petrobras corruption scheme, alleging that the former president received cash payments and other illicit benefits from the state-owned oil company, Petroleo Brasileiro S. More broadly, the Petrobras probe is concerned with investigating the possible illegal financing of political campaigns and other expenses of the ruling Workers' Party. Lula, who served as president from 2003 to 2011, is one of Brazil's most influential political figures. He is credited with having overseen an economic project that saw both dramatic economic growth and significant decreases in inequality. The slow burn of the Petrobras scandal has embroiled dozens of political and economic elites across Brazil in the high-profile corruption investigation that has spanned two years now. The first arrest connected to the case, of former Petrobras Paulo Roberto Costa, was made in March 2014. While several politicians and prominent business figures have been arrested or otherwise implicated in the Petrobras scandal, Lula de Silva is by far the highest-profile political figure to have been implicated to date. This latest development is the closest the investigation has come to the top echelons of power in the Workers' Party, including current president Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff has thus far managed to escape any direct implication in the scandal, despite having been the chairwoman of Petrobras from 2003 to 2010, the time period during which investigators say much of the alleged wrongdoing took place. She has denied any involvement. Rousseff immediately succeeded Lula de Silva in 2011 and was narrowly reelected to a second term in 2014. Worsening economic conditions and rising dissatisfaction with Rousseff's administration do not bode well for the sitting president, who has weathered multiple calls for impeachment in recent months. The current dynamic in Brazil in some ways is beginning to mimic events that took place in Guatemala in spring 2015, as the investigation into a customs fraud scheme slowly inched up the political ladder. What began as an investigation into relatively low-level customs officials spread quickly, eventually ensnaring then Vice President Roxana Baldetti and ultimately toppling former President Otto Perez Molina.

"Latin America Security Warnings for US Travelers Point to Flawed Policies. US authorities have issued new security warnings for individuals traveling to several Latin American countries, pointing to flaws in past and current US policies aimed at addressing crime and violence in the region. On January 10, the US State Department's online information platform for travel information announced a new four-level system for describing security conditions in foreign countries. The agency also issued advisories for several Latin American countries suggesting that US citizens reconsider or avoid traveling there. The State Department asked travelers to reconsider trips to El Salvador, due to violent crime and gang activity. The same applies to neighboring Guatemala and Honduras. Travel advice was also updated for Colombia. US authorities warned against traveling to a number of departments in Colombia ""due to crime and terrorism,"" and asked travelers to ""exercise increased caution"" when visiting the country. Five Mexican states -- Colima, Michoacan, Guerrero, Sinaloa and Tamaulipas -- were placed in the ""Do Not Travel"" category due to concerns about high levels of crime, while the government urged citizens to reconsider travel to 11 others. The United States has long worked with many of the countries for which advisories were issued in attempts to bring down their persistently high levels of crime and violence. But the new warnings against traveling to these nations serve as a type of admission that US-backed security policies have often fallen short of their goals. In the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, for example, the United States has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on security-related aid programs over the past decade with few evaluations of the effectiveness of this funding. Although homicide rates have seen recent decreases in all three countries, they remain among the most violent nations in the world. Colombia and Mexico have received billions in US security aid over the past decade. And while many security indicators in Colombia have been trending in a positive direction, major concerns linger over the future of the country's criminal landscape amid a huge boom in cocaine production. Mexico, on the other hand, is experiencing levels of violence unseen for years. SEE ALSO : InDepth Coverage of Homicides Of course, US policy is hardly the only factor shaping security outcomes in Latin America. But as InSight Crime recently noted , the administration of US President Donald Trump has struggled to find its bearings during its first year, often adopting contradictory rhetoric and counterproductive policies. For instance, just two days before warning US citizens to rethink traveling to El Salvador, the Trump administration announced that in September 2019 it will rescind immigration protections awarded to Salvadorans following a pair of earthquakes in 2001, putting nearly 200,000 immigrants at risk of deportation to the gang-plagued Central American country. Officials said the decision was based on a determination that ""the original conditions caused by the 2001 earthquakes no longer exist,"" and that ""the temporary inability of El Salvador to adequately return their nationals after the earthquake has been addressed."" (The administration made similar arguments last year when it ended protections offered to Haitians after a 2010 earthquake there, and it is weighing whether or not to cancel protections for Hondurans and Nicaraguans.) However, a number of non-governmental organizations including InSight Crime have argued that the move is likely to exacerbate already high levels of insecurity in El Salvador, and could paradoxically lead to more displacement and migration."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"The US Shouldnt Export Colombias Drug War Success. The US is paying Colombia to train security forces in Central America, without tracking whether this is doing good or causing harm. It's time for authorities to start asking hard questions about what lessons Colombia's military is exporting abroad. By the Colombian government's count, its security forces may have killed at least 4, 475 civilians. More than 5,000 state agents have been implicated. According to the United States government , the Colombian military continued to kill civilians through 2014. Yet, documents from the US Department of State and Department of Defense show the United States expanded funding this year for a program that pays the Andean nation to export its drug war and human rights ""know-how"" to new territories, despite the grave human rights concerns this fairly invisible strategy presents. Since 2007, and more intensively since 2011, the United States has paid for Colombian security forces to train military and police in Central America, the Caribbean, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru -- and even West Africa -- in counternarcotics tactics. According to documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, the United States supported the country's training of 6,526 police and soldiers from 10 Western Hemisphere countries, including Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama in 2014, more than five times the number trained in 2013. In 2015, the Colombian defense ministry reports that this program expanded to several Caribbean countries. The courses cover topics related to narcotrafficking --ranging from a six-month special forces training in Honduras and three weeks of riverine combat exercises in Panama, to instruction on police intelligence in El Salvador and Guatemala. Given the onslaught of damning accusations facing the upper echelons of Colombia's military, US taxpayers should be asking for details about what lessons are being exported to members of notoriously corrupt and abusive Mexican, Caribbean and Central American security forces. Colombia began in this role by training Afghani police. Due to a variety of factors, including dissimilarities in security landscapes, the results were not what policymakers had hoped. In 2009, Colombian forces started to intensify and expand their training programs to Mexican and Central American forces as security crises in those countries deepened. Although the existence of such training is no secret -- the participating governments promote it publicly-- key details remain hidden from the public. Since 2009, Colombia's military and police have trained 30,000 security force personnel from over 60 countries. The United States has helped fund some of this training, especially in the Western Hemisphere. However, there is little information about exactly who has been trained and how many US dollars have gone to these programs. US-backed Colombian security training outcomes are not monitored or evaluated by the legislative or federal branch. This lack of information makes it nearly impossible to know if this program has any positive effect, or if it is doing more harm than good. Congress, meanwhile, has asked few questions, despite the clear risk in outsourcing training from a security apparatus that has been regularly implicated in torture, disappearances, corruption and what Human Rights Watch has called ""widespread and systematic"" extrajudicial executions. Given the onslaught of damning accusations facing the upper echelons of Colombia's military, US taxpayers should be asking for details about what lessons are being exported to members of notoriously corrupt and abusive Mexican, Caribbean and Central American security forces. Exporting Colombia's Drug War ""Success"" The US government has justified this approach based on the widely held notion that the US-backed drug war succeeded in Colombia. Of the nearly $10 billion dollars the United States allocated through Plan Colombia between FY 2000 and FY 2015, almost $7 billion went to train, assist, advise and heavily equip the country's military and police, according to data from Security Assistance Monitor. During this time, security forces tallied wins against the FARC guerrillas, kidnappings subsided, and thousands of paramilitaries demobilized. But other security problems persisted, mutated, or even deepened in the country, while citizens, particularly Colombia's most vulnerable populations, incurred the high costs of war. Many of the issues addressed by Plan Colombia-- drug trafficking and drug production, organized crime, and violent competition over local markets and international trafficking corridors-- simply migrated. The same problems intensified: first in Mexico and then throughout Central America, which has become one of the most violent regions in the world. In Colombia, other forms of violence, such as forced displacement and extrajudicial executions committed by army troops, escalated at the highest mark of US military aid. Despite the lack of information on the actual impacts of this program, the United States increases its Colombian-led security training each year. The main reason the United States strongly supports this strategy is the price tag. It is far less expensive for the United States to pay for a trainee's room, board and military accouterment than to fund a cadre of US trainers to travel overseas. It also allows the United States to maintain a ""light footprint"" influence in several countries without the negative optics of a large military presence. US officials also see the strategy as a return on investment. William Brownfield, assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, noted in a 2013 congressional hearing, ""It's a dividend that we get for investing over $9 billion in support for Plan Colombia."" It is also an attractive option for Colombia's military. Should the government reach a peace agreement with FARC rebels, ending the country's 51-year armed conflict, the armed forces will need new missions to maintain their budget and ranks. Despite the lack of information on the actual impacts of this program, the United States increases its Colombian-led security training each year. In 2013, the United States supported 39 training events. In 2014, that number jumped to 152, and in 2015 it is planned to reach 205. US government officials have confirmed that while Colombia funds the instructors' salaries, the United States pays for trainers' and trainees' travel, lodging and meals. Since 2013, the number of soldiers who received training from Colombia's military with US-support has increased 720 percent. Defense Department documents show support for 179 trainees in 2013, 696 in 2014 and estimate some 1,470 will be trained in 2015. This year Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador will be the top recipients. Police trainees taking courses coordinated by the State Department have increased by almost 600 percent, with numbers shooting up from 848 trainees in 2013 to 5,830 in 2015. Honduran police are far and away the top beneficiary, with 3,068 national police slated to participate in the program this year alone. Mexico has been the largest recipient of Colombian military and police training, but this is largely an agreement between Colombia and Mexico. According to the Colombian government, the country's national police trained 10,310 Mexican police between 2009 and 2013. Many training courses are hosted in Colombia, but trainers also travel to recipient countries for short-term instruction or for extended periods to teach in war schools or policing academies. US government officials have confirmed that while Colombia funds the instructors' salaries, the United States pays for trainers' and trainees' travel, lodging and meals. Equipment and supplies such as ammunition and fuel are also provided by the United States. The Defense Department has spent some $4 million since 2013, while the State Department plunged nearly $12 million into the program in 2014 alone, primarily through the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), the main US assistance package to Central America. It is unclear how much was spent in previous years or how much is earmarked under CARSI for 2016. Additionally, the House of Representatives' 2016 budget for the State Department includes $10 million for Colombia to train police globally. On top of funding and coordinating Colombian-taught training exercises, the United States also provides substantial infrastructure. The US government supported the construction of a policing school with Colombian trainers in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and has invested almost $98.7 million of Defense Department funding since 2009 in a US Regional Helicopter Training Center in Melgar, Colombia, which hosts aviation courses, particularly for Mexican federal police. These transparency and accountability problems with Colombian trainers do not stop with the United States. Canada has also been boasting a similar program with Colombia as a key part of its security assistance to Central America since 2012. But like the US-sponsored programs, details for Canadian-funded training have not been made publicly available. Human Rights Risks of Exporting Colombian Security A central concern with the United States using Colombia's security forces as its training proxy is the military's staggering record of human rights violations. Colombian army officers are under investigation for murdering more than 4,475 civilians. These killings, known as ""false positives,"" typically involved execution of young men whom soldiers then dressed in guerrilla uniforms and claimed as enemy combatants killed in battle. As a recently published Human Rights Watch report on extrajudicial executions in Colombia lays out, there is strong evidence that several generals and colonels ""knew or should have known"" about these killings. Although a few State Department officials pushed for reforms, Washington's intensive support for Colombia's armed forces during this time is a clear example of turning a blind eye when a client behaves badly. US Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) told The Guardian , ""As we provided billions of dollars in aid to the Colombian army over many years, its troops systematically executed civilians."" Many other scandals have wracked the Colombian military, calling its ethos, and by extension the training it exports overseas, into question. To date, convictions have been handed down to mostly lower-ranking officers, just a few colonels and not one general. In fact, many have risen in the ranks and are now senior-ranking officials. The current head of the armed forces, Juan Pablo Rodriguez Barragan, is alleged to have been involved in at least 28 extrajudicial executions. General Jaime Lasprilla Villamizar received extensive US military training and served as an instructor of Latin American soldiers in 2002-03 at the US Army's Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC). He led a brigade that allegedly killed at least 75 civilians. He was the commander of the Colombian army until this past Tuesday, when he was replaced by an officer not publically implicated in the scandal. One of Lasprilla's students at WHINSEC, Honduran Major Mauricio Aleman Quiroz, was chief of naval intelligence during the military-led coup in Honduras in 2009. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos responded to the Human Rights Watch Report by saying it provided insufficient documentation for its claims. The head of the Colombian army in 2009 said , ""We are not going to continue to cry over spilled milk,"" in reference to the false positive executions. The military has dragged its heels in its cooperation with civilian investigations, often refusing to hand over crucial documentation. The Colombian government has tried to change legislation in order to send some of these alleged perpetrators back to military courts, which almost always dismiss the cases. For victims seeking justice for abuses committed by those trained by Colombians with US funds, the message is not encouraging. Many other scandals have wracked the Colombian military, calling its ethos, and by extension the training it exports overseas, into question. Despite impunity for atrocities Washington continues to peddle Colombia globally as the shining example of success in the drug war. There is clear evidence that paramilitary commanders, responsible for more atrocities than any other actor in Colombia's civil war, received institutional support from many Colombian police and military officers. More recent controversies include attempts by some military personnel to sabotage peace negotiations between the Colombian government and FARC guerrillas, through illegally wiretapping communications between negotiators. Although Colombian police do not have the same systematic abuse problems as the country's military, corruption in the civilian force remains an issue. This corruption has been key to criminal groups maintaining territorial control over entire neighborhoods in urban centers like Medellin and Cali. Issues of corruption have already arisen in this new US-Colombia strategy in Honduras. Since December, 71 agents and officers backed by the United States and trained by Colombian officers have been suspended for stealing $1.3 million seized in a raid against narcotraffickers. Of those implicated, 51 were members of the TIGRES, a SWAT-like, elite, militarized police force trained by Colombia's Comando Jungla Special Forces and the US Army's 7th Special Forces Group. The remaining 20 were members of a Sensitive Investigations Unit, a US-sponsored vetted team that works in conjunction with US law enforcement. Beyond human rights concerns, advocates worry about the message being sent to security and justices systems throughout the region. Despite impunity for atrocities, scandals, corruption, ongoing human and labor rights violations, and the existing severe security problems, Washington continues to peddle Colombia globally as the shining example of success in the drug war. Although US officials state that they vet trainers and students for US-funded training, lack of oversight and the failures of the Colombian justice system give cause for doubt. And history is telling. ""It's crystal clear that the United States has failed to conduct a serious vetting and scrutiny of the actions conducted by Colombian security forces with training, intelligence and equipment provided by the US government during all of these years,"" Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas director of Human Rights Watch said following the release of the organization's report. Although US officials state that they vet trainers and students for US-funded training, lack of oversight and the failures of the Colombian justice system give cause for doubt. The State Department designs the vetting process to screen students, not instructors. In fact, vetted Colombian trainers have taught at the US Army's Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (formerly the School of the Americas) and subsequently found guilty of murder. The Center for Public Integrity found a Colombian general teaching at the Defense Department's National Defense University, vetted by the Pentagon, had led a brigade whose members allowed a militia to carry out a massacre. Given these cases, strong oversight of vetting Colombian military and police instructors should be required. There also appears to be little oversight of the trainings themselves. Documents from both the Defense and State Departments claim staff ""oversees, manages and observes"" the training events. However, a government official close to the issue said that while personnel sometimes would go to trainings, there ""isn't enough bandwidth"" to monitor all trainings. US agencies do not review course content, but let the Colombians ""tropicalize"" US curriculum, according to a government source. In other words, they are allowed, unchecked, to put their own spin on existing content. In addition to the lack of information about what units are being trained, who is carrying out the trainings, and the content of the curriculum, there are concerns about with whom the United States is coordinating these courses. Honduras' police attache in Bogota, General Juan Carlos Bonilla, facilitates Colombian training of his country's forces, which raises serious questions. Bonilla is alleged to have participated directly in several extrajudicial killings as a regional police commander and was likely forced to resign his post as national police commander in December 2013 over claims of dozens of death squad killings by police under his command. This is not the first time that the United States has funded South American forces to train Central American security forces. In the 1980s, US-backed Argentine trainers -- veterans of Argentina's ""Dirty War"" and Operation Condor -- worked with the CIA to train Honduran soldiers who went on to fill the upper ranks of the infamous Battalion 316 , which tortured, killed, and disappeared hundreds of Hondurans. Egregious abuses did not come to light until key US documents were declassified many years later. What Can Be Done? Promoting Colombian military training of other countries' security forces is not a wise move, given the unresolved human rights problems within the Colombian armed forces. Congress and the public should be asking tough questions now instead of writing a check This training should at an absolute minimum be included in the annual Foreign Military Training Report (FMTR), which documents all US foreign military and police training worldwide. US officials say that as the law is currently written, public documentation is not required because Colombians, and not US officers, are conducting the trainings. This law should be clarified to require reporting on US-supported military training by non-US personnel and all police trainings. This would offer some critically needed transparency. It is also essential to establish a monitoring and evaluation system to determine the quality, utility, effectiveness, or unintended consequences of these programs. Despite the myriad concerns and risks, US-supported Colombian foreign security force training remains effectively invisible. The dollar costs, the programs supporting the training, and required reporting are to date either secret or not compiled. As this type of training becomes the new normal for US and Colombian security strategy in the hemisphere, Congress and the public should be asking tough questions now instead of writing a check, hoping for the best, and dealing with any mess or wasted dollars later.

"Ecuador Car Theft Rings Fuel Billion Dollar Transnational Trade. In 2013, Ecuador lost around $22 million and over 7,000 vehicles to car theft, a lucrative international trade that connects street level thieves to transnational organized crime groups. According to official statistics, 7,478 automobiles were reported stolen in Ecuador last year, 2,695 of which were later recovered. The trade is run by international ""mafias,"" reported El Comercio , who, according to one prosecutor cited, find Ecuador an attractive destination for stolen vehicles because of its dollarized economy. Police have reported the presence of criminal groups dedicated to the theft and transnational trafficking of cars in the Andean states of Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. Former Ecuadorean police investigator Segundo Pacha said the lowest link in the chain -- the person in charge of stealing a car -- receives a $500 cut. Those responsible for moving the car across borders then ""clone"" the vehicle, or change its characteristics to match those of a vehicle in legal circulation. The networks in charge of the trade make profits close to those of the original price of the vehicle, said Pacha. Officials have identified the Ecuador-Colombia border as particularly vulnerable to car trafficking, with criminals using secondary and tertiary roads, and also crossing by river into Colombia. In one case last year, 49 Ecuadorean vehicles were discovered in the Colombian municipality of Guacari, near the city of Cali. Networks of this type can be found across the region. A similar transnational ring to those discussed -- which trafficked stolen vehicles from throughout southern Colombia into Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru and Chile -- wa s broken up in Cali, Colombia last year. Like Ecuador, Bolivia is another important destination country for these stolen vehicles, due in part to an amnesty law allowing owners to legalize unregistered vehicles for a fee. Stolen vehicles are not only re-sold to unsuspecting buyers, they also often fall into the service of criminal groups, who may require an untraceable vehicle for anything from drug transport to carrying out assassinations. According to El Comercio, investigators have found stolen all-terrain vehicles are sold to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). There have also been reports of Brazilian cars stolen and exchanged for drugs and weapons in Bolivia and Paraguay. Sometimes the connections between drug trafficking and car theft are even closer: Pablo Escobar famously started as a car thief. More recently, Texis Cartel leader and drug trafficker Roberto Antonio Herrera Hernandez, alias ""El Burro,"" was arrested last July on car theft charges. Car theft is a highly lucrative business, of which the estimated profits from Ecuador's trade represent just a small percentage. International police body Interpol values the global trade at $19 billion annually, with seven million automobiles registered stolen in 2013. However, Mexico's vehicle protection agency has claimed the trade is worth $11 billion a year in that country alone."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Old Generation Gulf Cartel Leader Arrested in Mexico. The Mexican Navy announced the arrest of the brother of one of the original founders of the Gulf Cartel, Osiel Cardenas Guillen, in Tamaulipas state. Mario Cardenas Guillen was reportedly arrested Monday, a spokesperson for the marines said. He is the brother of Osiel, one-time leader of the Gulf Cartel and currently in prison in the US, and Antonio, alias "" Tony Tormenta ,"" killed in a shoot-out with marines in 2010. Mario reportedly assumed control of the organization after Tony Tormenta's death, alongside Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez, alias "" El Coss ."" Mario Cardenas already served a prison sentence in Mexico between 1995 and 2007, during which he helped run the family criminal business from behind bars. While serving time at the Cereso II prison in Matamoros, Cardenas was famous for running drugs and organizing gambling rings for horse races and cockfights, as El Universal highlighted in an article published in 2005. Cardenas' arrest could raise further questions about El Coss' ability to continue running the Gulf Cartel as a coherent organization. The group already suffered one major split shortly after Osiel's extradition to the US in 2007, when armed wing the Zetas broke off and became an independent criminal group. Since then, the Gulf Cartel has seen rival factions battle for control of the Reynosa and Matamoros plazas. But El Coss himself reportedly still enjoys high-level contacts with the military, offering him some protection from arrest, as InSight Crime has previously reported ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Overtakes Peru As Worlds Top Coca Cultivator: UN. Colombia has surpassed Peru in coca cultivation, according to a new United Nations report, and may have reclaimed its title as the world's top cocaine producer. Colombia and Peru's flip-flop as the world's largest supplier of coca is due to sharply contrasting trends in cultivation. With an estimated 42,900 hectares of coca grown in 2014, Peru registered a 14 percent decline from the previous year, according to a new report by the United Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Meanwhile, the UNODC recently calculated coca cultivation in Colombia jumped to 69,000 hectares last year, a 44 percent increase from 2013. Coca cultivation in Peru has been falling since 2011, when it reached a peak of 62,500 hectares. That year, the US government declared Peru was the world's top producer of cocaine, which was later confirmed by the UNODC in 2013. The reduction in coca crops has coincided with stepped-up eradication efforts by Peruvian authorities, with US support. Last December, government officials said they uprooted over 31,000 hectares of coca in Peru during 2014, the second consecutive year of record levels of eradication. However, due to security risks Peru does not eradicate coca in the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valleys (VRAEM). The triple-valley region is by far Peru's biggest coca-growing zone and a stronghold of left-wing guerrilla group the Shining Path. Cultivation in the VRAEM remained relatively stable in 2014, and represented 44 percent of all coca grown in the country (see UNODC chart below). The Aguaytia and Alto Huallaga regions saw the sharpest decline in coca cultivation last year, with both registering over a 60 percent decrease from 2013 levels. The Kcosnipata region in eastern Peru experienced the most significant expansion of coca crops, which the UNODC said was due to increased demand for cocaine paste that is smuggled across the border into Bolivia and later sent to Brazil. The UNODC report does not provide an estimate for Peru's potential cocaine yield, but the data suggests Colombia may once again be the world's top producer of the illicit drug. This is not certain despite Colombia overtaking Peru in cultivation, since Peruvian coca is capable of producing more cocaine than the crops found in Colombia, which are younger and have lower alkaloid content. Nonetheless, Colombia's coca crops now outnumber those in Peru by a significant margin -- over 30 percent, according to UNODC figures. What's more, is it highly possible the UNODC is underestimating the amount of coca grown in Colombia. Due to years of aerial fumigation, Colombian farmers mix coca with other crops and plant smaller fields, making it difficult for the UNODC's satellite imaging system to detect some areas of cultivation. Colombian coca crops can also be harvested up to six times per year, double the average number of yields in Peru. Diverging trends in eradication is one of the main factors that has enabled Colombia to outstrip Peru in coca cultivation. While eradication has reached record levels in Peru, the number of coca crops destroyed in Colombia has been falling steadily since the late 2000s. The recent decision by the Colombian government to end aerial fumigation may only exacerbate this pattern, since as much as 70 percent of all coca crops are sown in areas controlled by left-wing guerrilla group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). For security reasons, the manual eradication of coca is extremely difficult in FARC territory. The FARC are also keen to keep coca cultivation high, as it gives them greater leverage in the ongoing peace negotiations with the government. These dynamics suggest coca cultivation -- and by extension, cocaine production -- will continue to increase in Colombia during 2015. Sources on the ground have previously told InSight Crime cultivation is keeping pace with last year or even accelerating, and less eradication means more mature crops that yield a higher amount of cocaine. In Peru, the impressive eradication results are linked to the government's success in combating the Shining Path, which both regulates and protects the coca market. Following the arrest of rebel leader Florindo Eleuterio Flores Hala, alias ""Artemio,"" in February 2012, eradicators were able to penetrate his stronghold in the Monzon Valley, which is located in the Alto Huallaga region. This led to a nearly ten-fold reduction in the region's coca crops between 2012 (9,509 hectares) and 2014 (1,555 hectares). However, authorities have yet to penetrate the VRAEM, which doubles as the Shining Path's last remaining stronghold and the country's most prolific coca-growing region. Peru abandoned its eradication program in the VRAEM last June due to security risks posed by the Shining Path, and the government's alternative strategy -- a crop substitution plan -- has so far failed to produce results. If authorities hope to reduce coca cultivation in the VRAEM as it did in the Alto Huallaga, they will almost certainly have to break the Shining Path's grip on the region. Peru's success or failure in claiming control of the VRAEM will be decisive in the government's ongoing fight against international drug trafficking and narco-corruption. An estimated 200 tons of cocaine is produced every year in the remote jungle region, much of which supplies the cocaine air bridge that connects Peru to Brazil via Bolivia. This fact recently prompted one prominent politician to claim Peru is at risk of becoming a narco-state ."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Soldiers Allegedly Sold Weapons to FARCs Most Brutal Unit. Authorities in Colombia have arrested a group of soldiers accused of providing arms to the FARC, raising questions over both the sources of the guerrilla group's weapons and the extent of the problem in the armed forces. On April 29, Colombia's Attorney General's Office announced the detention of seven soldiers and six civilians for allegedly smuggling weapons and military supplies to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), criminal organizations known as BACRIM (from the Spanish for criminal bands), and common criminals, reported El Universal. According to El Espectador , the arrests were the result of an investigation that began in September 2013 following the capture of an individual carrying 8,000 rounds of ammunition that belonged to the army's First Brigade and were allegedly destined for the FARC's 10th Front. Investigators determined that the group -- which consisted of 20 people -- began trafficking weapons in 2012. Seven of these individuals were active service military, while three were retired soldiers. Another nine members of the network were affiliated with the FARC. To remove the weapons from military stockpiles, the soldiers issued false reports indicating the loss of supplies. In two years, the group stole an estimated 100,000 cartridges, 1,000 grenades, 30 rifles, and 10 machine guns. In addition to working with the FARC's 10th Front, the network also allegedly smuggled weapons to the 6th Front and Teofilo Forero mobile column. The discovery of an arms trafficking ring involving members of the Colombian military raises concerns that other soldiers could also be selling military supplies to guerrilla groups and criminal organizations. Indeed, this scandal is not without precedent , and high-ranking Colombian army officials have previously been accused of selling weapons to criminal groups including the Urabenos. In the past, the FARC have demonstrated a high degree of resourcefulness in securing arms, with neighboring Ecuador serving as an especially important source of weapons for the group. The FARC have also reached out to international arms dealers in order to purchase weapons, and even allegedly tried to obtain a $100 million loan from former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi in order to buy surface-to-air missiles, according to e-mails recovered from the computer of deceased FARC commander Luis Edgar Devia Silva, alias ""Raul Reyes."" Some FARC fronts, including the 6th Front, have also exchanged drugs for weapons with criminal groups like the Rastrojos. Although widespread animosity towards the FARC among Colombian soldiers would presumably limit the extent of weapons sales to the group, the fact that the soldiers involved in the most recent scandal were allegedly trafficking weapons to the Teofilo Forero Column is a disturbing development for the army. This column is considered to be the FARC's elite unit and was responsible for the 2003 Club El Nogal bombing in Bogota as well as a number of assassination attempts targeting Colombian officials -- including former President Alvaro Uribe ."	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
"Bolivia to Install Anti-Narcotics Base in Drug Trafficking Heartland. Bolivia announced it will install a permanent base in the eastern department of Santa Cruz to counter drug trafficking in the area, underscoring the region's importance to drug producers and foreign traffickers operating in the country. Bolivian Interior Minister Carlos Romero announced on October 3 that the base will be located in Yapacani, Santa Cruz, and will work to combat drug trafficking in the area, reported El Diario. The base will house agents from the country's anti-narcotics police unit (FELCN) and the Mobile Rural Patrol Unit (UMOPAR). Romero added that Yapacani, along with the towns of San German and Nuevo Horizonte, had been designated a drug trafficking ""red zone"" by the government due to the high level of smuggling activity there, reported Opinion.com. Within the past week alone, Bolivian authorities have uncovered 174 coca maceration pits and 350 kilos of cocaine in San German and Nuevo Horizonte. In Yapacani, anti-narcotics forces clashed with an armed drug trafficking group, killing one person and detaining 16 others, according to El Diario. Santa Cruz has become a drug-trafficking hotspot in recent years thanks largely to geography; it lies between Bolivia's coca-producing Cochabamba department and Brazil, Latin America's largest market for cocaine. Colombian intelligence estimated last year that up to 3,000 Colombian traffickers may operate in the region and there is evidence that Brazilian gangs the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) and the First Capital Command (PCC) run networks from Santa Cruz into Brazil. In one operation earlier this year, 90 cocaine laboratories were dismantled in San German. Santa Cruz's Attorney General's Office was asked by the government in August to investigate links between local officials and narcotics traffickers. Among those accused were FELCN agents, a former air force colonel and officers from the Santa Cruz police force. The US criticized Bolivia last month for not doing enough to counter drug operations within its territory, something the government rejected. This latest move reveals its apparent desire to effectively tackle trafficking in one of the country's worst hit areas."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Seizes Luxury Properties in Move Against Valle Drug Family. Authorities in Honduras have seized 52 properties belonging to one of the country's premier drug trafficking groups -- the Valle family -- in a move that could represent the beginning of a larger assault on the powerful clan. On August 18, authorities seized properties belonging to siblings Luis Alfonso, Miguel Arnulfo, Digna and Deisy Valle Valle in the provinces of Copan and Cortes. The operation involved over 200 police, prosecutors and personnel from the Administrative Office of Seized Assets (OABI), reported La Prensa. The properties included various residences and terrains, five estates, a farm, a hardware store, a cattle ranching business and a cafe. The residences were fitted out with luxury items, including pools, jacuzzis and bars. In one home, there was even a zone for erotic dance performances and a ""mini-hotel"" for housing special guests, reported El Heraldo. No arrests were made during the operation, reported La Tribuna. Authorities found the properties completely empty of any signs of life, reported El Heraldo. According to the regional commander of the special force Fusina, German Alfaro, the suspects had likely fled following the July capture of Digna Valle Valle in the United States. Other Valle properties are thought to be held currently in the names of front men. Luis Alfonso and Miguel Arnulfo allegedly run drug trafficking operations mainly out of the western Copan province -- on the border with Guatemala -- using a small criminal network. The Valles are thought to move up to 20 tons of cocaine a month through Honduras, mainly destined for the Sinaloa Cartel, with their operations facilitated by local government protection. Following on from the US arrest of Digna Valle Valle, the recent property seizures could represent the beginning of a wider move against the group in Honduras, likely spurred by pressure from the United States, which has indicted the family. It is also one of several moves indicating Honduras' government is targeting previously untouchable criminals. Last September, authorities seized $800 million in assets from the Cachiros -- Honduras' other major transport group -- also in the face of US pressure. Earlier this month, 17 properties were confiscated from the children of former drug trafficker Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, and this past spring, Honduras completed its first extradition to the US of a major drug trafficker. However, the question is what happens next. With no charges yet filed against any member of the Valles in Honduras, it is possible the property seizures are little more than a surface-level show put on for the US authorities. On the other hand, authorities may be purposely not issuing charges since any charges levied in Honduras could complicate extradition processes further down the line."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Arrests Knights Templar Leader, Cementing Groups Demise. Authorities in Mexico have arrested one of the last main leaders of the Knights Templar crime group, likely leaving the organization's already debilitated leadership in further disarray and raising questions about which organized crime groups may try to capitalize on their weakening. Ignacio Renteria Andrade, alias ""El Cenizo,"" was arrested in the Paracuaro municipality of Mexico's western state of Michoacan on June 21 after a confrontation between armed individuals and soldiers, Proceso reported. Renteria Andrade is the alleged leader of the Knights Templar (Caballeros Templarios), and reportedly had the largest territorial leadership of the group, Milenio reported. Renteria Andrade is expected to be transferred to the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Organized Crime Investigations (Subprocuraduria Especializada en Investigacion de Delincuencia Organizada - SEIDO) to be questioned by federal authorities, Proceso reported. Michoacan Gov. Silvano Aureoles congratulated authorities on the capture in a statement on his Twitter account , and said that Renteria Andrade was one of the ""main objectives"" in the state's security strategy. Renteria Andrade's arrest signals the further demise of the once-powerful Knights Templar. The group's leadership was gravely weakened after a series of deaths and arrests in 2014. One alleged top leader, Jesus Vazquez Macias, alias ""El Toro,"" was arrested in January, and in March, another leader, Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, alias ""El Chayo,"" was killed in a shootout with security forces in Michoacan. Just weeks after that, the criminal organization's second-in-command, Enrique Plancarte, alias ""El Kike,"" was killed in another firefight with the Mexican Navy. Servando Gomez, alias ""La Tuta,"" later took control over the Knights Templar as offensives by vigilante groups and state security forces in Michoacan placed increasing pressure on the group. But that didn't last long. Gomez was arrested by an elite Mexican police force in February 2015. Many felt that his capture effectively signaled the end of the Knights Templar. Renteria Andrade's arrest may be a final nail in the Knights Templar coffin. Most likely to seize upon the power vacuum left behind is the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (Jalisco Cartel - Nueva Generacion - CJNG). The CJNG has transformed into one of Mexico's most important organized crime groups , displacing other formerly notorious groups like the Knights Templar as they have become weakened."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Killing of Police Officers Spreads Fear in Venezuela. The recent killing of five police officers in Venezuela's capital raises the question of whether nervous police will continue to fight crime proactively, at a time when the government is using them more to patrol supermarkets and suppress protests. According to El Nacional , of the five police officers who were killed in Caracas last weekend, at least two were members of the National Bolivarian Police, a body meant to act as the city's highly-trained, community police force. El Nacional also reported that there were 132 police officers killed in Caracas in 2014, a 32 percent increase from those killed in 2013. The newspaper interviewed several officers who said that many police were feeling under threat, and were doing the minimum they could get away with to prevent and stop crime during their patrols. ""We don't go looking for the underworld because they can look for us,"" one police officer told the newspaper. The newspaper also reported that more police in Caracas are interested in going into private security, seeing it as a safer bet than police work. Sucre, a municipality in the Caracas metropolitan area, has seen 30 percent of its police force quit since 2012, while another municipality, Baruta, saw 40 police agents express an interest in going into private security in December alone, according to El Nacional. If more police in Caracas are feeling under threat, one risk is that more of them will continue relying on excessive force to respond to perceived threats. Venezuela's police are notoriously brutal: almost 3,500 people died in confrontations with police in Venezuela last year, according to non-governmental organization (NGO) the Venezuelan Violence Observatory. On January 10, eight people were reportedly killed in a confrontation with the security forces in northeastern Venezuela, including the investigative police force, the CICPC. Another question is if police morale is indeed sinking, what would the police response be in the event of another outbreak of social unrest in Venezuela? President Nicolas Maduro recently asked the security forces to maintain order in supermarkets, as people continue to queue up in long lines to buy basic goods. In the worst case scenario, should riots break out, the police may not be willing to put themselves in harm's way. Police killings are just one manifestation of Venezuela's pervasive violence, which saw about 16,500 homicides in 2014. A total of 18 bodies were brought to Caracas' morgue last weekend, including a member of the Presidential Guard ."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Colombia Seizes FARC Cocaine Destined for Sinaloa Cartel: Army. Colombia's security forces seized 1.4 tons of cocaine from the FARC rebels believed to be destined for Sinaloa Cartel contacts near the Panama border, an indication that Mexican groups are getting closer to buying at the source. Colombian anti-drug forces stopped members of the 57th Front of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in the Choco province, entering a region known as the Darien Gap along the Panama border carrying the cocaine, reported El Tiempo. Over 100 members of the Embera indigenous group, who authorities said had been paid by the FARC to each transport two kilos of cocaine in their backpacks, were detained with the rebels. Authorities believe that the drugs were headed to Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, based on information that Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman's cousin had been operating in the Panamanian border region. The cousin was part of the cartel's quality control team, said the army's anti-drug brigade commander Jorge Mora. The FARC has worked with the Sinaloa Cartel for years. Last March, the rebels were selling off drug franchises to the Mexican group. InSight Crime also received reports during 2012 field investigations that drug deals between the two groups have taken place in the Colombia-Ecuador border region , but the use of the Panama border for this purpose appears to be relatively new. What is also new is that the Sinaloa Cartel may be expanding its presence in Colombia , trying to get closer to the raw materials of production and thus control more of the profits across the distribution chain. This could help explain the cartel's presence at the Panama border, an important route for drug shipments. The dense jungle region of the Darien Gap is an operational center for the FARC's 57th Front, which is deeply involved in cocaine trafficking, and coca plantations recently found on the Panama side of the border were likely linked to the group.

"Argentina Arrests Head of Cordoba Anti-Drug Police. Authorities in Argentina have arrested the head of the Cordoba province antinarcotics police for alleged drug ties, in one example of the widespread police corruption affecting this Southern Cone nation. Amid a brewing scandal, members of the Airport Security Police (PSA) arrested anti-drug chief Rafael Gustavo Sosa in his home on September 11. Four other members of his unit turned themselves in later that night, reported Clarin. A week prior to the arrests, a police informant arrested in July accused Sosa and five other anti-drug police on public television of protecting and colluding with drug traffickers, though the investigation into these allegations began a month earlier, reported La Nacion (see video below). One of the officials mentioned in the video was subsequently found dead in his car, and is believed to have committed suicide. Sosa's arrest provoked a strong political reaction from officials of the Justicialist Party (PJ), who claimed the prosecutor who ordered the preceding raids was trying to discredit the police and was himself working for drug traffickers. The arrests that followed Channel 10's interview with the police informant appear to be related to a wider scandal. In a video put out in July by the same channel, various anti-drug police officers from Mina Clavero, Cordoba, reported a fellow inspector was working with a drug trafficking family known as ""Los Hoyos."" This same inspector, Gaston Bustos, is mentioned in another Channel 10 video secretly taken of a self-proclaimed drug trafficker and police informant discussing his dealings with police, who said they resold seized drugs and paid off informants with drugs. According to Channel 10 , this drug trafficker linked Viarnes with Sosa in the video. Police corruption has long been a serious problem throughout Argentina, and attempts to reform the force have seen little success. Buenos Aires is particularly affected, with over 13,000 investigated in the province in from 2008 to 2009 for corruption, irregularities and abuses. Argentine corruption is not limited to the police -- the current president is herself embroiled in a highly politicized money laundering scandal involving her late husband. The Cordoba province is one of Argentina's major drug hubs, home to one of the cities served by the country's infamous ""Ruta 34,"" the little-monitored highway stretching down from Bolivia that is used to traffic cocaine to Argentina's major cities."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexicos National Crime Now at Countrys Largest University. A gun battle on the campus of Mexico's largest university that left two dead underscores how the country's continued struggles with tackling criminal violence are playing out on the local level. On February 23, two individuals were killed after an altercation between two rival microtrafficking groups in an area known as Los Frontones located between the engineering and accounting departments on the main campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico's (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico - UNAM), which is known for petty drug dealing, El Universal reported. The Tlahuac Cartel, formerly led by Felipe de Jesus Perez Luna, alias ""El Ojos,"" before he was killed by Mexico's Navy in July 2017, was thought to operate freely and sell drugs in UNAM's Los Frontones region. However, the death of El Ojos, the arrest of his alleged successor Uriel Isaac ""N,"" alias El Cochi, soon after and the arrest of Ricardo Ferro Perez, alias ""El Peque"" or ""El Richi"" -- El Ojos' nephew and the cartel's latest leader -- created a power vacuum at UNAM, according to El Universal. The Tepito Cartel and the Rodolfos are now allegedly battling it out for control over microtrafficking on UNAM's campus, El Universal reported February 27. Both groups reportedly started battling with smaller cells of the Tlahuac Cartel in areas surrounding Mexico City before moving in on the UNAM campus following the weakening of the Tlahuac Cartel in order to try and assume control. The confrontations between the Tepito Cartel and the Rodolfos began in January of this year when they started fighting over control of petty drug dealing near UNAM's philosophy department, according to El Universal. The latest deadly clash on UNAM's campus is a stark example of how the country's broader difficulties with combating criminal groups and their criminal activities are playing out in the capital city. Officials in Mexico City have long denied the presence of organized crime groups, despite the mounting evidence that suggests otherwise. Authorities across the country have largely been unsuccessful in curbing criminality and related violence at the federal level -- 2017 was the country's most violent year in history -- and it seems that local authorities continue to face similar issues. Indeed, following the latest confrontation, a video published by Aristegui Noticias showed an UNAM student and members of the university's security force approaching a group of supposed microtraffickers to object against the sale and use of marijuana near the philosophy department. The alleged microtraffickers responded by threatening the student and security officials, telling them to ""go over to Los Frontones, where they kill for free."""	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
El Salvador Police Report Rise in Homicides. After falling dramatically in the wake of the gang truce, El Salvador 's homicide rate began to rise again in May and June, sparking concerns about the sustainability of the truce between the country's two main gangs, Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha ( MS-13 ). According to police officials, El Salvador had 182 murders in June 2013, up from 166 in the same month in 2012, reported La Prensa Grafica. June also saw an increase of 12 murders from the month before. During the first half of 2013, the country had 1,045 homicides, down from 1,562 during the same period in 2012. Violence began decreasing in February, hitting a low in April before beginning to rise again in May. The uptick in homicides in June has caused concern among Salvadoran authorities and led to a meeting between officials from the Ministry of Justice and Public Security and the National Civil Police (PNC) on June 29. Officials were particularly alarmed by the violence during the last weekend in June, which seemed to recall the days prior to the maras' gang truce: 32 homicides were registered between Friday and Sunday. Even with the rise registered in May and June, El Salvador's murder rate for the first half of 2013 represents a significant improvement compared to the previous year; prior to the truce in 2012, the country experienced an average of 14 homicides a day. However, despite the overall improvement that has been seen this year, the two-month pattern of increasing homicides, coupled with other disturbing trends such as a rise in extortion and disappearances , may undermine both public and institutional faith in the truce. Many in El Salvador, including critical civil society actors such as the Catholic Church , have already expressed skepticism about the future of the truce due to the government's lack of transparency about the negotiations and the exact terms of the gang agreement. Until now, the government has been able to point to the drop in murders as proof that the truce is working. If homicide rates continue to rise over the next few months the process could find itself in serious trouble.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Oil and Gas Theft in Mexico Doubled in 2013. Hydrocarbon theft in Mexico so far this year has nearly doubled in comparison with 2012, with the worst hit zones corresponding to some of Mexico's drug war hotspots. In the first four months of 2013, Mexican state oil company Pemex recorded 730 illegal siphons, in comparison to 377 last year, reported La Jornada. Of those siphons, 666 targeted pipelines operated by Pemex's oil refining arm, 40 its gas and petro-chemicals arm and 24 from Pemex Exploration and Production. The worst hit states were Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Sinaloa, the state of Mexico and Jalisco. Authorities have arrested 48 people for siphoning, and 180 more for transporting illegal fuel, so far this year. Between 2011 and 2012, the number of illegal siphons detected jumped 23.2 percent, from 1,416 to 1,744. Pemex attributed the rise predominantly to a growing interest in oil and gas theft among Mexico's organized crime groups, but also to advances in detecting siphons. In recent year, oil theft has gone from being characterized by petty theft and corruption within Pemex, to a large scale criminal operation carried out by major organized crime players, in particular the Zetas. Since the drug cartels got involved in the trade, recorded theft has been rising quickly , and appears to be still accelerating, suggesting the multi-million dollar trade is an increasingly important source of revenue for the groups involved. The idea that this acceleration is being fuelled by organized crime groups is supported by the geography of the trade. Of the states identified by Pemex, all but the State of Mexico have heavy drug cartel presence and the Zetas, who are behind much of the trade are believed to be present in all of them. While oil remains the easiest fuel to steal and resell, the number of siphons targeting Pemex's natural gas pipelines shows how criminal groups have also expanded into other hydrocarbon markets.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Shifting Alliances Cannot Halt Decline of Mexico Cartels. A new report argues that, far from fracturing, Mexico's drug trafficking groups are stronger than at the beginning of Calderon's time in office. However, this overlooks the fragile and fast-changing nature of alliances between these gangs, and the shifting nature of the power they wield. A recent article published by Proceso argues that Calderon's crime policy has not only coincided with a dramatic increase in the number of murders linked to organized crime, but has also had the perverse effect of strengthening the very gangs it should be weakening. Written by the longtime drug war chronicler Ricardo Ravelo, it states that: A bit more than five years after Calderon ordered the militarization of the country, the criminal networks of five cartels -- the Zetas, the Familia Michoacana, and the Sinaloa, Juarez, and Gulf Cartels -- now dominate more than half of the national territory. This expansion has occurred despite the blows these organizations have suffered through arrests or deaths of their leaders. However, this argument overlooks the most important development in Mexico's underworld in the last few years, which is the fracturing of larger gangs into dozens of smaller groups. This shift, which has been documented on numerous occasions by InSight Crime and other analysts , triggered the emergence of dozens of new regional groups, from the Mano con Ojos to the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG). The rise of these smaller bands has almost certainly meant a decline in the relative power of the larger, transnational groups that have long dominated Mexico. Meanwhile two of the biggest gangs three years ago -- the Beltran Leyva Organization and the Juarez Cartel , both of whom are mentioned among the gangs that have grown more powerful -- are a shell of their former selves today, hit by government pressure and wars with the Sinaloa Cartel. That's not to say that criticism of Calderon's policy is unwarranted; the changes outlined above have contributed enormously to the violence in Mexico. But there is little evidence for the claim that the largest groups are stronger now than they were five years ago. Ravelo's argument rests in large part on the alliances that have supposedly grouped the industry into two large federations. On one side stand Sinaloa and its allies: the Gulf Cartel , the Familia Michoacana , a collection of smaller gangs, and, reportedly, the Caballeros Templarios. The opposing bloc is led by the Zetas, and includes the Juarez Cartel, the Tijuana Cartel , and a pair of Beltran Leyva splinter groups. But a federation of distinct groups operating over a large chunk of geography, with some degree of coordination, is quite different from a single group dominating the same swath of territory. (It's also worth noting that Ravelo places several pairs of long-opposed gangs in the same federation, which makes his conclusions still more suspect.) Loose groupings like those described by Ravelo are held together by fragile alliances that are frequently broken, which is an important reason why organized crime groups today are less stable and more violent. A territorial expansion predicated on these alliances is not durable evidence for a strengthened group of big cartels. The report is based on maps from Mexican government agencies and a report from the consulting firm Stratfor (see map, above, by Stratfor). Though maps of criminal influence can be useful in determining criminal trends, ultimately they represent a two-dimensional tool that inevitably glosses over important details. No map, regardless of how well sourced it is, can tell us much about the degree of control over a given territory. It doesn't tell us if the prevailing group is run by out-of-towners who have co-opted local criminals, whether the mayor's office is thought to support the local capos, or how likely control of a given area is to change hands from one gang to another. Similarly, Ravelo says nothing about the type of control exercised by the Mexican gangs today. Whereas in 2005 drug smugglers operated outside of the public eye and without much contact with the legitimate Mexico, today organized crime groups have ramped up extortion, kidnapping, carjacking and other crimes that directly prey on civilians. Ravelo's failure to discuss this is odd, because it appears that his goal is to point out the flaws in the government policy. Nothing does so better than pointing out that the fractured criminal underworld of today, which Calderon is at least partially responsible for bringing into existence, is far more likely to bring harm to law-abiding Mexicans than the tidy landscape of four major cartels that existed five years ago. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
What Marchs Murder Rate Says About Trends in Mexico Violence. Last month's murder figures have some positive implications for Mexico, argues Alejandro Hope -- violence continues to fall in the long term, with signs that criminal groups may be shifting towards policies of more caution and lower visibility. March's statistics on the state of violence in the country bring both good and bad news. As in previous months, all the data comes from the Executive Secretariat of the National System of Public Security. And once again, a clarification: the figures are used to indicate trends. As is already well known, there is under-reporting of all crimes (including homicide), but there is strong evidence that the error is more or less systematic. Official information tells us where we are going, but it doesn't quite tell us where we are. Let's begin with the bad news: - With data missing from three states (Distrito Federal, San Luis Potosi, and Zacatecas), the total homicides this month can be estimated at 1,732. This is the highest homicide rate since October. - After seven consecutive months of falls, there was a rise in the three-month moving average (from 1,629 in February to 1,666 in March). - Some states that had maintained a decreasing homicide rate for several months registered an upturn. The cases of Chihuahua (from 191 homicides in February to 217 in March), Sinaloa (from 122 to 142), and Guerrero (from 139 to 186) stand out. Chihuahua regained first place in the national homicide ranking. - The northeast maintains an increasing trend: in the first quarter, the number of homicides in Nuevo Leon grew by 44 percent in comparison with the same time frame last year. There was 32 percent increase in Veracruz, 26 percent in Tamaulipas, and 25 percent in Coahuila. Now for the good news, which is not negligible: - Reports of extortion continue rising compared to last year: in March, they were up 11 percent from the same month in 2012, and in the first three months of 2012, the on-year increase was 28 percent. This is a difficult statistic to interpret because it may have been partially caused by the information campaigns about telephone extortion. Either way, I don't like the figure. - March was the third consecutive month of reduction in the inter-year homicide rate: compared with the same month in 2011, the number of homicides in March was down 7.1 percent. - The average number of daily homicides in March was identical to that of February (56). The increase in the total number of homicides in March was due to the greater number of days in the month. - More importantly, the number of homicides in the first trimester this year was down 6.9 percent in comparison with the same period last year. This is the first time that such a decrease has been registered since the last quarter of 2007. Adjusting for the fact that the first trimester of 2012 had one more day than in 2011, the reduction was 8 percent. - This trimester's total was the lowest seen in two years. Since the January-March period in 2010, there has not been a trimester with fewer than 5,000 homicides - Compared with the last three months of 2011, the drop was 3.2 percent. This is the third consecutive trimester of reduction in comparison with the previous trimester. From the peak in killings in the second quarter of 2011, the cumulative decrease has now come to 16.5 percent. That means 1,000 homicides less in this trimester than in the period between April and June of 2011. This is not a trivial figure. - Despite the increase in March, Chihuahua registered a drop of 29 percent in the trimester. In Sinaloa and Baja California, the reduction was 22 percent. In Jalisco, the number of homicides fell by 10 percent and even in Guerrero there was a marginal drop in homicides (1 percent). - The downward trend extended to other crimes: at the national level, reports of kidnappings decreased by 34 percent in the trimester, and reports of violent auto-thefts fell by 10 percent. In general, the annual rate of violent theft appears to have fallen 5 percent in the first three months of this year. In summary, it seems to me that there's not much doubt that the great spiral in violence between 2008 and 2010 came to a halt last year, and is gradually beginning to retreat. Here it's important to emphasize the word gradual: the reduction on a national scale is still very slow. And it worries me that the monthly average of homicides stopped falling in March. For reasons not fully clear to me, there seems to be a level of resistance between 1,600 and 1,650 homicides per month. I still don't understand exactly what is happening. There are some very tentative signs of the increased efficacy of some state authorities: for example, a significant number of the prisoners that escaped from the Apodaca prison have been recaptured. Some criminal groups may be changing their behavior in response to this new institutional environment: in general, there appear to have been fewer high-impact incidents in this trimester than in prior periods. This is only an impression, because I don't have systematized information, but in this trimester I could only identify two incidents with more than 20 victims, and both were in prisons (Apodaca and Altamira). Is there an incipient shift towards greater caution and less visibility on the part of some criminal groups? I'm not sure, but it's an idea worth exploring. Lastly, it's possible that in some localities, the process of pacification may be fueling itself: Ciudad Juarez has had no fewer than four days without homicides so far this April -- something that had not happened since January 2008. In short, March did not deliver many positive numbers. But in general, criminal violence is still moving in the right direction (downward). I hope we can say the same in the coming months.

"Mexico Captures Sinaloa Meth Maker, in Latest Blow to Cartel. Federal police arrested a major methamphetamine producer for the Sinaloa Cartel in northwest Mexico, in another blow to Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman's criminal organization. Jaime Herrera Herrera, alias ""El Viejito"", had been working for the cartel since 2002, producing the drug in two ranches outside the city of Cuiliacan, reports El Informador. He was arrested in the US in the 1990s and later released on bail, after which he began distributing methamphetamine in Los Angeles, California and eventually producing the drug in Mexico. Another man was arrested with Herrera, and police found weapons, 202 kilograms of methamphetamine, and other drugs. The arrest of one of the cartel's major methamphetamine producers is a reminder of the increasing importance of the drug to its operations. With the decline of the Familia Michoacana , the Sinaloa Cartel is thought to have become Mexico's biggest meth producer. There have been at least five major arrests of Sinaloa Cartel members since November, as El Informador notes, and Herrera's capture could represent a serious blow for the group. This has caused speculation that the government is increasing pressure on the organization, and that fugitive boss Joaquin Guzman, alias ""El Chapo,"" could be captured soon. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"How Venezuelas Stolen Gold Ended Up in Turkey, Uganda and Beyond. What do such distant countries as Venezuela, the Bahamas, Ireland, Morocco, Dubai and Turkey have in common? They were all part of the trade routes for illicit Venezuelan gold in 2018. The Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) sold 73.2 tons of gold in 2018 to two companies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and one in Turkey. The sales took place without the National Assembly's approval, as mandated by Article 187 of the National Constitution. The claim, presented in February 2019 by deputy Carlos Paparoni, president of the National Assembly Finance Commission, recalled there could be no contracts of national public interest with foreign states or companies without the approval of the parliament. *This article was edited for greater clarity and published with the approval of Runrun.es. It does not necessarily represent InSight Crime's opinions. Read the original article here. Runrun had access to leaked documents that detailed how the BCV's gold exited the country throughout 2018. The data was compared with information from Flightradar24.com , a public website with real-time information about global air traffic, allowing the verification of each flight's routes and reference numbers. Some of these transfers of gold were made on private aircraft but others went aboard commercial Turkish Airlines flights from Caracas to Istanbul. According to the customs records accessed by Runrun, 73,2 tons of gold bars were sold between the Emirati company Noor Capital (27.396 tons), the Turkish company, Sardes Kiymetli Madenler A.S (23.994 tons), and a Belgian firm based in the United Arab Emirates, Goetz Gold LLC (21.886 tons). A total of 33 gold bar shipments were transported on 27 Turkish Airlines, and five on Copa Airlines (Panama), Solar Cargo (Venezuela), Rotana Jet Airlines and E-Cargo Airlines (both from the UAE). Only one of the 33 flights has not yet been identified. The total of gold exported by the BCV in 2018 was eight times higher than the 8.65 tons of internal gold production registered in Venezuela up to May 2018. It is unknown whether the 73 tons exported by Venezuela during 2018 came from the BCV's reserves or from unreported production in the Orinoco Mining Arc. Although there has been a 56 percent fall in gold reserves since Nicolas Maduro took office in 2013, there was a slight increase of 11 tons 150,216 gold tons in January to 161,22 tons in September 2018, according to data from the World Gold Council. These numbers include the 8,6 tons registered by the BCV as 2018's internal production. ""Blood Gold"" is Booming Business 21.8 of the 73.2 gold tons exported by the BCV in 2018 were bought by Goetz Gold LLC, a Belgian company with offices in Dubai, and which is facing severe scrutiny. It is being investigated by anti-corruption agencies in Europe and Africa for trading in ""blood gold"", defined as metal extracted in areas of conflict, financing crime and wars, and promoting the violation of human rights. Goetz Gold LLC is part of the Tony Goetz group , headquartered in Antwerp, Belgium, known as the global capital of the diamond trade. Goetz Gold is under suspicion for being part of an illegal trafficking network of conflict minerals. The company exports gold to Europe and the US processed by the African company African Gold Refinery (AGR) in Uganda, the largest refinery in sub-Saharan Africa and completely owned by the Belgian consortium. Part of the material this factory uses to produce their gold bars comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where the vast majority of mining activity is illegal and serves as a financing source for the purchase of arms. These accusations are based on the compelling investigation, ""The Golden Laundromat"", published in October 2018 by The Sentry. This is an anticorruption organization based in Washington DC, which monitors businesses contributing to violence in Africa, co-founded by US actor George Clooney. But the gold refined by the AGR does not only come from their African neighbors. Recently, the Ugandan company admitted to receiving material from an unspecified country in South America. The Ugandan official media indicated this country could be Venezuela, where the government currently relies on gold sales to obtain liquidity amid its collapsed economy and to avoid sanctions imposed by the US and Europe. On March 13, police authorities in Uganda announced they were investigating the legality of an import of 7.4 tons of gold to the Ugandan refinery made in March 2019 with an estimated value of US$300 million. Goetz Gold bought 21.8 tons of gold from Venezuela in 2018, which represented 30 percent all international sales of gold by the central bank. The largest single shipment of 15.6 tons happened on December 3, 2018, shortly after the US announced sanctions on anyone carrying out transactions involving Venezuelan gold. The gold sourced by Goetz Gold was transported from Maiquetia Airport by Emirati airline Rotana Jet and Russian airline E-Cargo, neither of which have commercial flights from Venezuela. Runrun.es attempted to confirm these facts with Goetz Gold president, Alain Goetz, in February 2019 but received no answer. Turkey and Unrefined Gold Almost 24 tons of Venezuelan gold (23.994 kilograms) had left for Istanbul onboard 28 flights executed between January and September 2018, as stated in the leaked information obtained by Runrun.es. After departing from Venezuela, the ""blood gold"" -extracted from deposits being controlled by criminal groups, where massacres are known to take place and workers who disagree are often murdered- was taken on by the private Turkish company Sardes Kiymetli Madenler A.S. This company had a sales agreement with Maduro, through the BCV, according to the revelation made by deputy Carlos Paparoni in early February. The documents indicate that each of the Sardes flights transported between 226 and 3,721 kilograms of gold. Most of the 27 flights were by Turkish Airlines, which started operating in Venezuela in 2016 and since increased weekly flights from Caracas to Istanbul from three to five. Only one of the flights involved another airline, Panama's Copa Airlines, which transported 543 kilograms of gold on March 20, 2018. Even though Copa denied involvement in of this flight, this itinerary's explanation can be found in the code share agreement between Turkish and Copa Airlines , signed in April 2017. Both companies are members of the global airline network Star Alliance. Every week, a number of Copa flights depart from Maiquetia, transfer in Panama and continue to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines aircraft. The March 20 flight was one such occasion. The majority of gold transfers, 23 out of 28, happened during the first half of the year. By May 2018, 21.3 tons had already been transferred to Istanbul at a value of US$779 million. Reuters confirmed the shipments reached a value of US$900 million for the entire year. Last July, Venezuela's minister in charge of mining development, Victor Cano, acknowledged that the central bank had begun exporting gold to Turkey to be refined there, a process that had not happened in the past. There are no reports of this gold returning to Venezuela. Venezuela had previously sent gold to be refined in Venezuela but US sanctions caused the European country to draw back from this practice. This is not the first time that Turkey has established commercial relations with countries sanctioned by the US Treasury Department. Iran is one such case, which according to Bloomberg , buys billions of dollars of oil from Venezuela. The money from these transactions goes to Turkish accounts where it is ""trapped"" due to international restrictions. Previously, however, gold was also used in trade with Iran. A BBC story revealed suspicions about the presence of Venezuelan gold in Iran. *This article was edited for greater clarity and published with the approval of Runrun.es.

"Another Prison Scandal in Colombia as Woman Found in Capos Cell. Colombia's prison authorities faced more questions after a woman was found in the jail cell of an ex-paramilitary leader in the high security wing of a Bogota prison. The woman, who was not identified in the El Tiempo newspaper article recounting the incident, entered the best guarded part of La Picota, to visit Dumar de Jesus Guerrero, alias ""Carecuchillo."" Guerrero escaped from La Picota in February this year but was recaptured in May. The escape cost the director of the National Prison Institute (INPEC) his job and caused many to question the ability of INPEC to control its prison population, many of which include powerful and well-connected criminals such as Guerrero. Guerrero is jailed for his involvement with Colombia's right-wing paramilitary groups known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), and could be charged for a 1997 massacre in the small village of Mapiripan in which dozens of civilians were executed for their alleged connection to leftist rebels in the zone. Carecuchillo is also the brother of the Popular Revolutionary Antiterrorist Army of Colombia ( ERPAC) leader Pedro Oliverio Guerrero, alias "" Cuchillo ."" The ERPAC are now one of the three biggest drug trafficking groups in the country, with presence in at least five departments on Colombia's eastern plains. The government announced that INPEC will undergo a ""profound reform"" during the first six months of 2011, amid systematic overcrowding and frequent cases of corruption. Police Gustavo Adolfo Ricaurte Tapia was appointed the new INPEC director in November and will oversee the changes. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mayor Goes Free, Mexico Fails Again to Prosecute Corrupt Politicians. The collapse of a criminal case against the former mayor of Cancun adds another embarrassment to a string of failed attempts by Mexico 's authorities to charge politicians allegedly linked to organized crime. Gregorio Sanchez was released from government custody in Mexico City after officials determined that there was not enough evidence to link him to the Sinaloa Cartel , for whom he had been accused of laundering money. However, he was fitted with a monitoring bracelet and ordered to remain in the city while authorities investigated charges of human trafficking. This was the second release in recent days for Sanchez; after more than a year in prison in Nayarit on charges that he protected the Zetas in Cancun, he was released last week after a judge found no evidence of wrongdoing. Upon his release, Sanchez was rearrested while investigators dug into the accusations of links with Sinaloa, the Zetas' longtime enemies. The former mayor of Cancun and member of the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) was originally arrested in May 2010 , while campaigning to be governor of Quintana Roo. Although he was more than 20 points down in most polls, many accused of Calderon's government of using the fight against organized crime to tilt the political playing field. Such accusations have grown more frequent as administration officials have responded to his exoneration on one charge by seeking to implicate Sanchez on another. Two of the other recent attempts to strike blows against political support for organized crime also failed miserably. The arrest of Jorge Hank Rhon , the former mayor of Tijuana and scion of one of the most prominent political families, fell apart within weeks after it was revealed that the army manipulated the evidence against Hank. The Hank debacle followed the 2009 arrest of dozens of state and local officials in Calderon's home state of Michoacan, in an episode dubbed the ""michoacanazo."" Eventually, after languishing in prison awaiting trials for years in some cases, every one of the accused was released, and the charges dismissed. Political adversaries of Calderon have pointed to the incidents as evidence that the government has politicized public security in Mexico -- Hank is a member of the opposition Institutional Party of the Revolution (PRI). However, while a majority of the Michoacan arrestees were also opposition politicians, some were also members of Calderon's National Action Party (PAN). If the arrest was an attempt at political point scoring, it backfired. Calderon's government came out looking far worse after each episode, and in the case of Hank, whose links to organized crime have long been rumored, the failed prosecution seems to have given a boost to his political ambitions. Thriving on the extra attention, and the rare chance to play the victim, Hank has mused about the possibility of another run for the governor's post in Baja California, which he almost won in 2007. The inability to punish political sponsors of organized crime from every party has been a persistent shortcoming of Mexico's anti-crime efforts. While dirty police are often arrested by the dozen, and even the capos have lost much of their erstwhile invincibility, the successful prosecution of a political patron is rare indeed. Calderon has said that the main problem is corrupt judges, and has even claimed that he knows how much judges are paid to ignore the evidence against bent politicians. However, even if Calderon's accusations have weight (they sparked vigorous denials from members of the judicial branch), at least some of the problem, as the Hank case shows, is due to Mexican police and prosecutor's inability to build a proper case. The inability to convict suspects is not limited to political cases. As InSight Crime noted in April , the Mexican Justice Department's own figures show that just 28 percent of all federal arrests in 2010 resulted in a trial, to say nothing of a conviction. In the remainder, the cases were dismissed because of procedural errors or a lack of evidence. Quintana Roo has a long history of links to organized crime. A relatively short flight across the Caribbean from Colombia, the state was the home to much of the Juarez Cartel 's organization in the 1990s, and in recent years has been controlled by the Zetas. The former governor of Quintana Roo, Mario Villanueva, served time in Mexico for protecting drug traffickers, and was later extradited to the U.S. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"GameChangers 2019: Latin Americas Top 10 Criminal Groups. Colombia's last rebel army is now the most powerful criminal syndicate in Latin America, as it expands across Colombia and far into Venezuela, deepening its involvement in the drug trade. The National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) has resisted the best efforts of the Colombian government, and its US ally, for more than five decades. Friends in high places in Caracas are helping the ELN become a Colombo-Venezuelan revolutionary army, with profound consequences for both nations and the regional criminal panorama. Yet Latin America remains home to a diverse range of criminal groups, many of which expanded their territory or criminal economies, or consolidated their power base in 2019. Click on the map to see larger version This list only includes the non-state illegal actors, not those governments where organized crime has penetrated the highest echelons and put state assets at the service of criminal activity, like in Venezuela and arguably, Honduras. For the last two years InSight Crime has been working on methodology to measure and compare criminal groups around the region using the following indicators: 1. Structure Here is where the ELN excels with its politico-military structure, which has survived the offensives of US-backed Colombian governments, right-wing paramilitaries and other Colombian criminal groups for over five decades. Despite having been almost wiped out several times, the ELN has always bounced back , rebuilding and further compartmentalizing its structure and increasing its resilience to all forms of attack. The fighting divisions, or War Fronts (Frentes de Guerra), provide the structural framework and then the individual fronts (frentes) act like military battalions, divided into companies and units. There are no other criminal structures, except the ex-FARC Mafia , that can compete with this kind of quasi-military cohesion. The nature of the prison gangs like the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC), Red Command (Comando Vermelho - CV), MS13 and Barrio 18 is resilient, but fragmented, based around different prisons and different cliques, meaning they operate more as a franchise than as a centrally driven organization. The Sinaloa Cartel , after the capture of Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias "" El Chapo ,"" may have seen more power concentrated in the hands of Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias ""El Mayo,"" but it is a federation of different and often disconnected elements, each with great autonomy and independence of action. 2. Core leadership Some of the core leadership of the ELN, the members of the Central Command (Comando Central - COCE) have been with the group since its foundation, or joined soon after, meaning that the group has senior leadership with decades of experience. There are no criminal structures in Latin America that have such long-standing and experienced leadership. Yet with the arrival in 2015 of Gustavo Anibal Giraldo Quinchia, alias ""Pablito,"" to the COCE, ELN leadership got a significant boost. Belligerent, innovative and radical, Pablito represents a younger generation of rebel commanders, ideologically committed, while not allowing revolutionary beliefs to limit revenue raising or strategy. Among the other top ten groups are other hugely experiences leaders like El Mayo of the Sinaloa Cartel, who started his career in the 1980s with the Juarez Cartel and who has evaded all attempts to capture him. Dairo Antonio Usuga, alias ""Otoniel,"" started life in the 1980s as a Marxist guerrilla, before transforming into a right-wing paramilitary, and today heads Colombia's Urabenos or Gaitanista Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia - AGC). 3. Identity Criminal structures all seek some identity, code or ideology to facilitate recruitment, build reputation and brand, as well as ensuring loyalty. The most successful criminal structures in history, like the Sicilian Mafia or the Yakuza, have managed to create a mythology that has translated into a strict code of conduct with initiation rites. The ELN has Marxism-Leninism at its heart, with figures like Fidel Castro and Che Guevara acting as the icons of its ideology. While there are debates as to how this ideology sits with criminal activity, the ELN has a strong ideological component , and most of its members believe they are fighting for a just cause. This provides powerful motivation and loyalty. The prison gangs in El Salvador, like MS13 and Barrio 18 have grown quickly due to the adoption of initiation rituals and the use of tattoos that form a uniform and clearly mark belonging and loyalty. While they have a rule book, their cause is the protection of their own, much the same as Brazil's PCC and Red Command. Like the Italian mafias, many of the Mexican cartels have a strong geographic component, with the Sinaloa Cartel relying heavily on recruits from the state of the same name and the strong regional culture. SEE ALSO : GameChangers 2019 - Illegal Mining, Latin America's Go-To Criminal Economy 4. Economic Strength This corresponds not only to the earning power of a criminal structure but the diversity of its criminal portfolio and ability to absorb losses such as drug seizures. Money laundering capacity and penetration of the legal economy are also measured under this category. The ELN has seen its economic resilience increase in the last four years. Once dependent almost wholly on kidnapping and extortion, Colombia's last rebel group is now deeply involved in illegal mining, smuggling, and drug trafficking. It has taken advantage of the chaos in Venezuela and affinity with the regime to assume control of key routes into this troubled nation and invested in real estate along the border. The PCC's explosive growth over the last few years is due to its deepening involvement in the cocaine trade. While its initial earnings lay in the micro-trafficking of drugs in prisons and then in its home base of Sao Paulo, today the PCC sources cocaine in Bolivia, Colombia and Paraguay and is involved in the movement of drug shipments abroad, particularly to Europe, via ports like Santos. The Sinaloa Cartel is the exception that proves the rule. It has resisted the temptation of other Mexican cartels to get involved in extortion, kidnapping and human trafficking, concentrating on its strength: drug trafficking. 5. State Penetration Organized crime has two main tools: violence and corruption. The ideal condition for a criminal group is to have the state not just leave operations unmolested, but actually protect them. Unlike Africa, where much of the criminal structures are state embedded, in Latin America the majority are non-state actors, and therefore vulnerable to state actions. This is the case for the ELN in Colombia, where the group is public enemy 1. However in Venezuela, it is a very different story and President Nicolas Maduro sees the Colombian guerrillas as support for his regime and a shield along the border with Colombia. This has allowed the ELN to thrive in Venezuela, put down even deeper roots and increase control over criminal economies. The Sinaloa Cartel, unlike the CJNG and former rivals like the Zetas, has preferred to use ""plata"" (silver) rather than ""plomo"" (lead) where possible. This is a more efficient business model and explains why the Zetas have been consigned to history while Sinaloa keeps going strong. The prison gangs are naturally antagonistic to the state, although the truces negotiated with the government by MS13 and Barrio 18 in El Salvador from 2012 showed that even the most brutal street gangs are open to dialogue and politics. SEE ALSO : El Chapo Has Been Jailed for Life, But is Mexico Better Off? 6. Threat or Use of Violence Violence and organized crime in Latin America are indivisible. In a market where there is no legal recourse to the breaking of agreements, the reputation for violence is a key element to doing business. With just eight percent of the world's population, Latin America accounts for 33 percent of all murders. Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela account for a quarter of all the murders on Earth. Yet the most violent criminal organizations are not necessarily the most successful, although three of the groups on our list, MS13, Barrio 18 and the CJNG have a reputation for indiscriminate and terrorizing levels of violence. While this brings them immense credibility on the criminal stage, it also ensures they are priority targets for security forces. The ELN is no stranger to violence, but many such acts are of an insurgent , rather than a purely criminal nature. This makes the rebels a priority target for the Colombian government, but since they control and regulate violence within Venezuela, they are seen as a quasi-legitimate force there. 7. Military Capacity and Numbers One thing is engaging in indiscriminate murder. Another is the ability to carry out sophisticated and precise military-style operations to facilitate and protect criminal enterprises and having the trained personnel needed for such activities. The Central American street gangs can terrorize people into paying extortion and have even been able to ambush the odd police unit. They can call on tens of thousands of members across the Northern Triangle nations (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras). However, the ELN has been able to paralyze entire provinces in Colombia, carry out military offensives to take territory from the state, and plant bombs in police installations in Bogota. This rebel army can currently call on up to 4,000 personnel with military training and thousands more collaborators. The ELN have been able to manufacture homemade mortars and have an arsenal that rivals many militaries in the region. As part of this measurement we look not only at the operational capacity of the criminal groups, but their armament, military training and the strategic application of violence. One of the reasons Brazil's PCC has moved towards the top of the criminal league has been its ability to carry out sophisticated operations. In 2017, up to 50 members of the gang, using dynamite and assault rifles, were able to rob $8 million from a Paraguayan vault, launching a diversionary attack on a police station, before fleeing in speed boats. 8. Criminal Alliances In an increasingly fragmented criminal world that extends its global reach on a daily basis, the importance of alliances cannot be understated. The days of the Medellin Cartel, which controlled the cocaine industry from production to distribution in the United States, are long gone. Now, most criminal structures are networks, relying on multiple nodes to complete complex supply chains across the world and handle the millions of dollars that move in the opposite direction. The only way to prosper is to work with other criminal organizations and corrupt state officials. SEE ALSO : PCC-'Ndrangheta, the International Criminal Alliance Flooding Europe with Cocaine The ELN, for a supposedly ideological guerrilla army, has been surprisingly pragmatic about allying itself with other criminal actors where necessary or providing services to other illegal networks. At the moment the ELN can count on parts of the ex-FARC Mafia as allies, elements of the Venezuelan state , as well as Venezuelan "" colectivos ."" Through its political work, it can count on a constellation of radical left-wing groups around the region. At the local level, the ELN work with dozens of criminal actors, collecting ""taxes"" to allow drug trafficking organizations to pass through their territory, or providing protection services to drug laboratories, marijuana greenhouses, illegal airstrips and submarine shipyards. There is almost no link in the drug chain in Colombia where the ELN do not have a role in their areas of influence. The same goes for illegal mining. ELN units on the Pacific Coast are working with Mexican cartels to ensure the regular flow of cocaine to Central America. The Sinaloa Cartel operates in anything up to 54 nations across the world, depending on a complex series of alliances. However, gangs like MS13 and Barrio 18 are not so good at working with other actors, hence the fact that many of their criminal activities are purely national (extortion and kidnapping), rather than transnational (drug trafficking, human trafficking) where greater cooperation is essential. 9. Territorial Reach and Criminal Governance Most criminal economies require the control of territory. It might be the coveted crossing points on the Mexican-US border, or coca crops in Colombia, or the alluvial gold deposits in parts of South America. It is no coincidence that some of the most violent cities in Latin America are home to ports, the departure points for multi-ton drug shipments. Whichever criminal actors can control these areas are guaranteed control of the illegal rents they contain. Equally relevant under this heading is how the criminal groups maintain control of these territories. The most sophisticated groups have produced parallel states, or criminal enclaves, where they exercise functions normally reserved for governments, like raising taxes or dispensing justice. Control of such areas not only provide criminal rents, but a steady flow of recruits. The ELN do exactly this in many of its areas of operation , penetrating municipal authorities, charging ""protection"" fees and adjudicating in local disputes. In parts of Colombia and Venezuela, the rebels are seen as a legitimate force, able to provide far more effective and reliable governance than the state. For the prison gangs, control of the jails, which are often centers of organized crime, is a regular feature of their ""criminal governance"" and a source of recruits as well as income. 10. Longevity The acid test for a criminal group is its longevity. If a powerful criminal syndicate is able to survive for years, or in the case of many of those on our list, decades, this is a testament to their resilience, earning power and operational capacity. Again, the ELN leads the way , having been in existence since 1964, and being more powerful today than ever before. Most of the powerful prison gangs on our list are relatively young compared to the ELN. The oldest is the Red Command , born in a Rio de Janeiro prison in the 1970s as a self-protection group for prisoners. The PCC was born in 1993, while the MS13 and Barrio 18 evolved in the Northern Triangle after the mass deportation of criminals from the United States in the early 2000s. The newest group on the list, the ex-FARC Mafia , born after the signing of a peace agreement between the FARC and the Colombian government in 2016, is taking advantage of the experience of former rebel fighters and has sought to adopt FARC mythology and political discourse to create its identity and brand. While the Urabenos were only formed in 2006, they have adopted much of the symbols and identity of their predecessors, the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC), giving them more power and criminal maturity than their youth would suggest.

"35 Dead Zetas Dumped on Busy Street in Veracruz, Mexico. The bodies of 35 alleged Zetas members were left beneath an underpass in downtown Veracruz, south Mexico, in the latest sign that the group is taking a hit to its activities on the Gulf coast. Motorists along the busy avenue of Ruiz Cortine in the Mexican port city of Veracruz encountered a gruesome roadblock on Tuesday afternoon: two abandoned pickup trucks, each carrying more than a dozen dead bodies. According to eyewitness accounts, an number of masked men had stopped traffic along the road around 5:00 p.m., pointing weapons at passersby as they opened up the gates of the truck beds before abandoning the vehicles. The men also left an ominous ""narcomanta,"" or drug banner, claiming that the victims had been killed for their allegiance to the Zetas : This will happen to all those Zeta s--- who remain in Veracruz. The plaza now has a new owner: G.N. Here lies ""El Ferras"" and his royal court. According to state Attorney General Reynaldo Escobar Perez, several of the victims have been identified as possible escapees in a prison breakout that occurred on Monday, in which 32 inmates from three different prisons allegedly managed to overcome their guards and escape. Several of them were captured soon after, but 18 remained at large on Tuesday. The jailbreak was blamed on the Zetas, for whom the activity is something of a specialty. In 2010, the state of Tamaulipas lost more than 350 inmates to jailbreaks, most of which were attributed to the Zetas. The banner's mention of ""G.N."" is a clear reference to the Gente Nueva, an enforcer gang which has been linked to Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias "" El Chapo ."" Gente Nueva got their start working as hitmen for Guzman, and have been blamed for contributing to the violence in the border city of Ciudad Juarez. There the group earned the reputation of being a bitter enemy of La Linea, a gang who serve as foot soldiers for Vicente Carrillo Fuentes ' Juarez Cartel. Interestingly, ""El Ferras"" is the alias of Felipe Ferra Gomez, an individual who became an Internet celebrity in 2008 after a video was posted online of him bragging to police about murdering an individual. The video has received over 13 million hits on YouTube. Although his death has not been confirmed, Ferra was reportedly among those who escaped from prison on Monday. So far as is known, Ferra did not have anything like enough importance in the criminal world to merit being named in a narco banner as the cause of 35 deaths. Thus, he may have been targeted for the public recognition he gained the Internet, offering another proof that what happens online can have real life consequences in Mexico's drug war. Last week two individuals were killed and hung from a bridge in Nuevo Laredo, apparently for criticizing the Zetas on a popular blog which tracks organized crime. Like Nuevo Laredo, the city of Veracruz has traditionally been Zetas territory. The murders would appear to be a direct affront to their control of the ""plaza,"" which is perhaps not surprising considering that the Zetas have come under increasing pressure in recent weeks. Earlier this year, narcomantas signed by the Sinaloa, Gulf , and Familia gangs were hung around Mexico, declaring their intention to band together in a common front against the Zetas. In early July the Mexican government formally announced that dismantling the group was the first priority of their security strategy, and U.S. president Obama recently designated the Zetas as the target of sanctions under the Kingpin Act , allowing the Justice Department to seize the group's assets in the country. If the Gente Nueva are indeed behind the attack, this indicates that the Zetas are facing a new enemy in Veracruz. As noted above, the Gente are based primarily in the northern state of Chihuahua. Their arrival to Veracruz not only suggests that they may be winning the battle in Juarez, but also that they are developing as a serious criminal force in their own right. As InSight Crime has reported , there has been some infighting between Gente Nueva factions in recent months, supporting the theory that they are ready to expand their turf into other parts of the country.

"Mexico Kills Zetas Founder As Cartels Decline Continues. Police have killed an original member of Mexico's vicious Zetas drug cartel, marking the latest loss among the group's Special Forces founders, who ushered in an era of brutal violence and the militarization of Mexican organized crime. Galindo Mellado Cruz, alias ""El Mellado"" or ""Z-9,"" was killed in a gun battle on May 9 in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, reported Excelsior. Mellado was one of the original 30 ex-special forces members that criminalized to form the Zetas, which was originally the paramilitary wing of the Gulf Cartel. The shootout took place after a raid on Mellado's hideout and also resulted in the death of four other gunmen and a Mexican solider. A Tamaulipas state official said Mellado -- who had been on the run after escaping from prison -- no longer occupied a command position within the Zetas, reported Excelsior. In 2012, ""narcomanta"" banners signed by the Zetas labeled Mellado a traitor and an informant and some unconfirmed reports suggest he had defected to the Gulf Cartel. Mellado's death comes amid a recent spike in violence in Reynosa as the remnants of the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas battle for the city. The Gulf Cartel's hiring of former military members to serve as bodyguards and armed enforcers was a game changer for Mexico's underworld, prompting rival drug cartels to follow by militarizing and focusing more on territorial control. The original 30 members of the Zetas defected from the Mexican Army's elite Airborne Special Forces Group, transferring their military training into a newly disciplined and sophisticated approach to organized crime, involving previously unseen levels of intelligence gathering and military style tactics. The Zetas became famed for their ruthless violence , and in 2010 struck out on their own after a fall out with the Gulf Cartel's leadership. They expanded rapidly throughout Mexico, and into Guatemala and Central America. Yet over time, as the original core members were killed or captured, the military base of the Zetas has become diluted. Their opponents began to mimic their tactics, and there is now arguably little setting the Zetas apart from their rivals. The loss of leadership has contributed to the fragmentation of the group into isolated and territory based factions, which, in turn, has opened a power vacuum in Mexico's northern regions. As the bloodshed in Reynosa shows, the resurgent yet similarly fractured Gulf Cartel has reinserted itself in territory previously contested or controlled by the Zetas."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Mexico City Replaces All Airport Federal Police After Shooting. All 348 federal police officers at the Mexico City international airport have been replaced, in an effort to stamp out corruption at a terminal thought to be a major hub for the drug trade. The replacements follow a June 25 shootout between federal police at the airport, in which three officers were killed. The chief of regional security for the federal police, Luis Cardenas Palomino, said all the officers had been reassigned to posts in other states, and have been replaced by police who have passed double vetting and background checks, reported the Associated Press. After the shooting, the federal police said that the dead officers had been trying to arrest colleagues accused of being part of a drug ring run operating at the airport. Two of the three suspected shooters are still on the run, and have claimed that the other officers were in fact trying to force them to join a smuggling ring. Mexican authorities often resort to department-wide purges to fight corruption within police forces that have been infiltrated by organized crime. Last year, the state of Veracruz fired some 980 state policemen because officials believed the force had been infiltrated by the Zetas criminal gang. Nuevo Leon has got rid of more than half of its 2,200 policemen since 2009, and the federal police force sacked 10 percent of its officers in the first months of 2010. Mexico City airport is a prize location for drug trafficking, as shipments can easily be hidden among the large amount of passengers and cargo passing through. Government reports indicated that trafficking through the airport is currently controlled by the Sinaloa Cartel. The mass transfer of staff indicates that the government is prepared to take tough measures to crack down on drug trafficking through this crucial transport hub. 	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Report Leak Undermines Bolivias Legal Coca Policies. An opposition politician says he has seen a long-delayed report on Bolivia's coca cultivation and that it concludes the country needs only 6,000 hectares to meet legal demand, claims the government has denied but which could place its pro-coca policies in a precarious position. Juan del Granado, a member of the Movimiento sin Miedo (Without Fear Movement) party, claimed he had gained access to the European Union-funded report on Bolivia's legal coca market, reported La Razon. According to Granado, the investigation found Bolivia could satisfy legal demand for coca using just 6,000 hectares of productive land. The report is the result of a study commissioned in 2007 that aimed to determine the exact quantity of land Bolivia needs to meet domestic and commercial demand for coca. According to EU officials, the study was completed in 2010 , however Bolivian authorities have repeatedly delayed its release, claiming they were still working on several complementary studies, reported La Razon. The government responded to the claim by announcing the complementary studies have now been completed and the final report will be presented before the end of the year. Bolivia's Vice Minister for Coca and Development, Gumercindo Pucho, dismissed the 6,000 hectares claim as ""absurd."" Granado's allegations are almost certainly a political maneuver to undermine Morales' policy of licensed coca crops as the country prepares for the 2014 presidential elections. However, the lengthy delay of the report's release is also likely driven by political motives. Morales was once a coca grower and still heads one of the country's major coca growing unions, and coca growers remain an important part of his political base. Recent violence between Bolivian authorities and people protesting the eradication of unlicensed coca crops only highlights how unpopular it would be to propose the country's 12,000 hectare legal crop quota should be halved. See also: Coverage of Drug Policy Bolivia's combative stance on coca has also caused international tensions, which have led to the expulsion of US officials , temporary withdrawal from a UN drug treaty and the United States closing its local anti-drug office. With some politicians proposing to increase the legal quota to 20,000 hectares while Bolivia receives millions in international anti-drug aid annually, the issue of how much coca Bolivia needs to satisfy commercial demand is more sensitive than ever, both internationally and at home. If this leak forces the government into finally releasing the report and the findings are as reported, Morales will have to perform a very delicate juggling act to placate both the international community and his electoral base. *This article was updated on October 28 to include the government response"	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Gulf Cartel and Zetas Run Narco-Toll Bridge in East Mexico. The Zetas and Gulf Cartel are imposing a toll on travel between two states in eastern Mexico, in a case highlighting the extent of the incursion of organized crime into daily life where the state lacks presence. The rival criminal groups are charging motorists around $39 per week, or $232 per month, to cross the Moralillo Bridge, which connects the cities of Tampico in Tamaulipas state and Panuco in Veracruz state. Charges are based on the vehicle type and can be as high as $389, with those who refuse to pay liable to have their vehicle stolen or be kidnapped, reported Milenio. According to Milenio, the Tamaulipas side of the bridge is controlled by the Gulf Cartel, while the Zetas levy fees on people leaving Veracruz. The newspaper reported that there is no visible law enforcement presence in the communities at either end of the bridge, and residents have been squeezed so hard by extortion demands from the cartels that many businesses are shuttered and properties abandoned. The flagrant and well organized nature of this extortion -- with motorists offered weekly and monthly charges and discounts for frequent travel -- is indicative of the infiltration of organized crime into day-to-day life in Mexican communities and continued neglect of certain regions by the country's security services. The ability of these cartels to maintain such a racket when it would arguably only require a minor police presence at each end of the bridge is symptomatic of the ineffective protection provided by the state that many of the country's self-defense groups cite as their cause to take up arms. While the southwest is the stronghold of such groups, they have been reportedly springing up elsewhere , including Tamaulipas and Veracruz. Meanwhile, the fact cartels have taken to imposing road tolls only underscores the scope of their criminal diversification, and willingness to take advantage of any money making opportunity. In recent years cartels have increasingly moved into such diverse fields as cargo theft , cattle trafficking and mining , as well as expanding their activities in more traditional criminal sectors such as kidnapping and extortion .	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"US is Negotiating with El Chapo: Ex-Mexican President. As the Mexican government claims to be getting closer to capturing the country's most notorious drug lord, an ex-president claims that the US is negotiating the terms of ""El Chapo's"" surrender. According to a Milenio interview (see video below) with former President Vicente Fox, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is in the process of negotiating with several high-profile cartel leaders, offering them reduced prison sentences if they turn themselves in. Among them is Joaquin Guzman, alias ""El Chapo,"" the head of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel. Fox also pointed out that drug consumption in the US is the cause of much of the violence in Mexico. He argued that, for this reason, the US should take more responsibility in the fight against drug cartels, asking: ""Are we not doing their work for them?"" This is not the first time that Fox has made a controversial statement regarding the drug war. In August the former head of state called for the Mexican government to ""gather the violent groups to a truce and evaluate the advantages of an amnesty law,"" in a bid to reduce violence. Two months later, in an October interview with the BBC , he argued that the US should legalize drugs in order to reduce the demand for illicit substances in Mexico. He has also advocated drug legalization. Although Fox did not cite a source for his assertion about Guzman, it would hardly be surprising if the US were holding talks with the drug lord. Such negotiations are a hallmark of successful law enforcement work. The DEA has engaged in negotiations with drug traffickers in Colombia for years, and is currently rumored to be talking to the leaders of the Rastrojos drug gang as well as trafficking kingpin Daniel Barrera Barrera, alias "" El Loco ."" Indeed, there is reason to suspect that such negotiations have already taken place in Mexico. Jesus Vicente Zambada Niebla, the son of a Sinaloa Cartel head, was arrested in 2009 and extradited to the US. He has alleged that US officials worked out an agreement with the cartel to reduce the law enforcement pressure on the gang in exchange for information on other groups. If more evidence of these negotiations emerges, it will put the administration of President Felipe Calderon in a tight spot. Calderon has flatly denied rumors that his government engages in negotiations with drug gangs, and has criticized suggestions that it should consider doing so. It will be especially damaging to the president if it comes out that US officials are communicating with Guzman, because the Mexican government has attempted to portray itself as on the verge of capturing him.

"Though Peru Destroys Trafficking Airstrips, Shining Path Still Profits. The Peruvian military has stepped up its efforts to destroy remote airstrips used for drug trafficking in a key rebel area, but the offensive has had little effect on the Shining Path's ability to profit from the drug trade. Military forces in Peru have intensified efforts to curb cocaine trafficking in one of Peru's largest coca production regions, in the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valleys (VRAEM), by destroying more than 120 airstrips since March, reported El Comercio. As options for transporting shipments of cocaine via air become more restricted, traffickers have resorted to more traditional methods of trafficking, moving drugs on foot across rough terrain in groups of up to 20 men called 'cargachos' or 'mochileros.' The Shining Path is reportedly being contracted to provide security for these human caravans. The Shining Path, which has long operated in the VRAEM, has in recent years deepened its involvement with the drug trafficking industry in the region. It is now believed that the group derives a majority of its income from regulating and ""taxing"" the cocaine leaving the region and by providing security and caravan protection services for drug shipments. Even with traffickers looking for alternative routes, the Shining Path is still able to profit as they provide security for shipments no matter how they leave the region. The flexible nature of the services that the Shining Path provides drug traffickers is proving to be a challenge for the Peruvian military, making for a difficult game of cat and mouse. It appears that the taxation and service provision structure the Shining Path has established in relation to drug trafficking in the VRAEM allows them to profit no matter the military's tactical posture. This latest revelation about how the Shining Path is connected to drug networks in Peru comes on the heels of an announcement from the US Treasury blacklisting the group as a 'significant foreign narcotics trafficker' in addition to the rebels' longstanding designation as a terrorist organization under US law. A recent report alleged connections between the Shining Path and a group of Colombian drug traffickers, which combined with the US narcotics designation indicates the Shining Path is now a major drug trafficking organization."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Bolivia Uses G77 Post to Put Coca Legalization on International Agenda. As Bolivia assumed the presidency of the United Nations Group of 77 (G-77), President Evo Morales used this opportunity to push his pro-coca agenda, likely hoping to capitalize on the international attention surrounding moves towards drug reform elsewhere in the region. On January 8, Morales marked the beginning of Bolivia's one year term chairing the United Nations (UN) coalition of developing nations with a speech promoting the use of coca leaf and calling for its removal from the UN list of banned drugs. Morales also highlighted Bolivia's success in obtaining recognition of the legitimate use of coca leaf within the country from the UN after it rejoined the UN Convention on Narcotic Drugs , which it had left in protest over coca's banned status. In a press conference following the speech, Morales also spoke about the country's successes following the ""nationalization"" of Bolivia's counter-narcotics efforts, referring to the severing of ties with US anti-drug bodies. While Morales' speech was in large part an affirmation of a longstanding agenda, it was also a statement of intent, showing he plans to use Bolivia's position at the head of the G77 to reignite debate over coca use. Morales is no doubt aware that this is an ideal moment to do so. The eyes of the world are currently turned to the marijuana legalization reforms underway in Uruguay and in Colorado and Washington in the United States , which have placed the issue of drug policy firmly on the international agenda. While Bolivia has already obtained international consent to the use of coca leaf within its territory, if it is to create a sustainable ""coca-yes, cocaine-no"" policy then it will also need coca use to be recognized as legitimate internationally. Currently, Bolivia produces an estimated 25,000 hectares of coca a year, while, according to a recent study , its legal market can be supplied by closer to 14,000 hectares. Until now, attempts by Morales to bolster the domestic market for legal coca-derived products have been largely unsuccessful. If Bolivia is to stop coca being diverted into cocaine production without devastating the livelihoods of coca farmers -- an important political base for Morales -- then access to international markets for legal coca products will be essential."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Sinaloa Cartel-Linked Drug Network Dismantled in El Salvador. Authorities in El Salvador have captured nearly two dozen members of a criminal network with ties to the Sinaloa Cartel, highlighting the importance of Central America's Northern Triangle region to the hemisphere's most powerful drug trafficking organization. Members of El Salvador's Attorney General's Office (Fiscalia General de la Republica - FGR) and National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil - PNC) made the arrests on the night of February 5 and morning of February 6 following 14 months of investigation, the FGR announced in a statement. A total of 22 suspects were captured, including the alleged head of the network in El Salvador, Jose Leonidas Gomez Cuellar, alias ""Pepe."" The group worked under Guatemalan national Marlon Francesco Monroy Meono, alias ""Fantasma,"" a high-level drug trafficker who was arrested in April 2016 and extradited to the United States in November. In addition to allegedly acting as a middleman for Colombian drug traffickers and Mexico's Sinloa Cartel, Monroy Meono has been linked to scandals connected to current Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales and his jailed predeccessor, Otto Perez Molina. (See the FGR's chart below) According to the FGR, the Salvadoran network pretended to be small-scale fishermen but were in fact carrying out a variety of tasks for drug traffickers moving through El Salvador's Pacific coast on go-fast boats. This included refueling the boats and protecting them as they reached shore, as well monitoring the location of patrol ships. Between January and June 2016, authorities confiscated some 400 kilos of cocaine connected to the group during two interdiction operations. The arrests draw attention to the crucial role that El Salvador, along with the other Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala and Honduras, play in sustaining the drug trafficking operations of Mexican organized crime. According to a 2012 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Mexican cartels have moved 90 percent of their cocaine trafficking operations to Central America. The Sinaloa Cartel in particular, widely considered the most powerful in the Western Hemisphere, has deep roots and extensive contacts in the region. In January 2015, the US Treasury Department designated as a ""kingpin"" the cartel's former leader in Central America, Cesar Gastelum Serrano, who US officials believe was influential enough to negotiate directly with top Sinaloa bosses. And it was in Guatemala that legendary Sinaloa drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman was arrested for the first time , back in 1993."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Rastrojos Losses Could Mean Violent Power Struggle in Colombia. The loss of several top leaders of the Rastrojos has created a dangerous power vacuum within the gang and in their territory, raising the chance of violence, as a report in Semana magazine sets out. Despite recent captures of top Rastrojos leaders, Colombia's Semana warns that the violence is not over. Instead, the shifting leadership in the Colombian crime syndicate could create a power vacuum and cause increased violence in the country. The Rastrojos , once one of Colombia's most powerful crime syndicates, has faced numerous losses in recent months. On May 8, it was announced that Rastrojos boss Javier Calle Serna, alias ""Comba,"" (pictured) had cut a deal with US authorities. The following month, Venezuelan authorities captured Diego Perez Henao, alias "" Diego Rastrojo ,"" the founding leader of the criminal group. Adding to the syndicate's troubles, Colombian police arrested Comba's alleged successor Edison Pelaez Jaramillo, aka ""Mincho,"" on July 3. Although Semana identifies some potential heirs to the Rastrojos leadership, the most prominent of which are members with the aliases ""Mascota"" and ""William"" who direct the group's hitmen, it is not clear who will be the syndicate's next leader. With no clear leader in place, the Rastrojos risk a territorial war, with rival groups like the Urabenos hoping to take advantage of the power vacuum and expand into Rastrojos territory. There is also a danger of internal strife within the group. The Colombian syndicate was already struggling before the loss of two of its most important leaders. In recent months, the group had split between the supporters of the Calle Serna brothers and those of ""Diego Rastrojo."" It is possible that these divisions could widen, especially as up-and-coming gang members struggle for power. If the Rastrojos do not manage to find a clear leader soon, or if the gap between the factions widens, the organization could break into splinter groups. The emergence of new, smaller groups battling for territory could drive further violence, as seen in Mexico. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Why Has the Italian Mafia Returned to Colombia?A spate of recent arrests suggests the Italian mafia may be making a comeback in Colombia, where the fractured criminal landscape makes it easier for them to exert control over the drug trade. The first to fall was Iacomino Tomasso, formerly the right hand man of legendary Cosa Nostra leader Bernardo Provenzano, also known as ""The Capo of Capos,"" who was arrested in 2006. Tomasso was arrested in Bogota, from where he had allegedly been running a trafficking network that sent cocaine shipments from the Caribbean coast to another Italian mafia group, la Camorra. According to the authorities, Tomasso worked closely with a Colombian partner, Juan Carlos Davila Bonilla , alias ""El Gordo,"" who was arrested shortly after. The pair also employed the narco-paramilitary group the Urabenos to provide security for their shipments, according to the authoritites. Two months later, Tomasso's arrest was followed by the capture of two drug traffickers working for rival organization the 'Ndrangheta: Santo Scipione and Domenico Trimboli. Scipione, who is believed to have lived in Colombia since 2000, is one of the highest ranking 'Ndrangheta capos, while Trimboli, working on Scipione's orders, handled the logistics of the mafia's Colombia-Italy cocaine connection. Officials say that while the 'Ndrangheta also maintained logistical networks in the Caribbean, their main trafficking method was sending shipments from the Pacific coast on boats which head up to the Panama Canal before crossing the Atlantic. The arrests were the result of a three-year international operation that brought together Interpol with law enforcement agencies from Colombia, Italy, and the US. Iacomino Tomasso has a long history of operating in Colombia and over the years has been a key player in developing networks linking Colombian cartels to the Italian mafia. His capture this year was the second time he has been arrested in Colombia - the first came just weeks after his boss Provenzano was arrested in 2006. At the time, Tomasso was operating as the Sicilian mafias' point man in the Colombian cocaine trade, making deals and alliances with the drug trafficking organizations in Valle de Cauca, Antioquia, and along the coast. However, it is the arrests of the Scipione and Trimboli that are key to understanding the main connections between Colombia and Italy today. Over the last 20 years, the 'Ndrangheta has come to dominate the cocaine trade in Italy, and has used its profits -- estimated to be between $30 and $50 billion a year -- to become arguably Italy's most powerful organized crime group. The 'Ndrangheta or Calabrian Mafia is one of four main Italian organized crime groups operating today, along with the Cosa Nostra, or the Sicilian Mafia; the Camorra or Neapolitan Mafia; and the Sacra Corona Unita or United Sacred Crown. According to the FBI , the four groups have approximately 25,000 members in total, with 250,000 affiliates worldwide and cells in Canada, South America, Australia, and parts of Europe The origins of the 'Ndrangheta date back to the 19th century , but the group remained a mostly local federation of crime families until its entrance into the drug trade. According to experts on the 'Ndrangheta , the families first entered the cocaine trade buying imported drugs from the Cosa Nostra, whose entrance into Colombia had been facilitated by Tomasso. By the end of the 90s, they had established their own networks and worked closely with the notorious paramilitary warlord and leader of the AUC, Salvatore Mancuso, whose appeal was increased by his Italian heritage. By 2004 Italian authorities estimated the group was responsible for bringing in 80 percent of the cocaine that entered the country. However as the axis of the cocaine trafficking world shifted from Colombia to Mexico, so did the Italian mafia. Again, the Cosa Nostra seems to have led the way, with the brothers Elio and Bruno Gerardi acting as their connection in Mexico after fleeing the attentions of law enforcement agencies in Colombia. But again, the 'Ndrangheta was not far behind: the organization established links with the Gulf Cartel, then did business with the Zetas after they broke away from the Gulf Cartel in 2010. However, there are numerous disadvantages for the Italian mafia groups in doing business with the Mexicans. Logistically, it adds an extra leg to the journey, which increases costs and risks. There is also the fact that the big Mexican cartels dominate the cocaine world through wealth, power and violence, which leaves little room for negotiation over who does what and how much they get paid. Then there are the growing signs that the Mexican cartels, among them the Zetas, are looking to increase their influence inside Europe to profit from distribution networks, as they do in the United States. The fact that the Mexicans are able to force the mafia groups into this secondary role may well be one of the factors fuelling the return of the capos to Colombia. The tectonic shifts in the cocaine trade over the last 20 years have left the Colombian underworld much more fractured and its organized crime groups less capable of asserting dominance. As shown in Tomasso's case, even the most powerful of Colombia's criminal groups, the Urabenos, often do little more than provide traffickers with security services and guard shipments, leaving their cut substantially less than what the Mexicans would take. It could be, as the Colombian police have suggested , that the rebirth of the Italian mafia in Colombia is little more than Italian traffickers reigniting old contacts after serving prison sentences in Italy. However, given the adaptability and flexibility the groups have shown in the past in finding new markets and opportunities, it is likely also influenced by the fact that they see dealing with Colombians as a way to exert more control -- and thus extract more profits from the cocaine trade."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
Tracking Hidden Graves Across Mexico. A government report gives a sense of the number of clandestine graves across Mexico, drawing further attention to the government's flawed procedures for tracking disappearances. Between December 2006 and February 2015, the remains of 601 humans were found in 174 clandestine grave sites throughout Mexico, El Universal reported, citing a report obtained from the Attorney General's Office (PGR) via a freedom of information act request. Clandestine grave sites are used by criminal groups in Mexico and other parts of Latin America to hide the bodies of victims. According to the PGR report, the number of clandestine graves is clearly linked to the country's battle against organized crime: only 8.1 percent of the graves were discovered prior to April 2011. Clandestine graves were found in 16 of Mexico's 32 states, with Guerrero , Jalisco and Tamaulipas topping the list. Of the human remains found, 80 percent have yet to be identified. The remains included 302 males and 40 females, with the remaining 259 indeterminate. A number of Central American migrants were also identified amongst the remains, the report said. Although shocking enough on their own, the latest statistics from the Attorney General's Office have likely underreported the number of victims found in unmarked graves. Under Mexico's current system, when police find clandestine graves, they report them to the state prosecutor's office. It is then up to the state government to share that information with the federal government, and sadly states often choose not to. The absence of credible statistics on disappearances can lead to bad policy decisions, as well as increase distrust in the government and encourage perpetrators of forced disappearances who believe their victims will never be found, and their deaths never investigated. Mexico congressional representatives have responded to the situation with multiple legislative proposals. Initiatives include the creation of a new agency dedicated to investigating forced disappearances, improved protocols for identifying human remains, and classifying force disappearances as a crime against humanity. However, it remains unclear if these measure will improve the sharing of information between the state and federal government. Graphic by BuzzFeed	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"California Meth Seizures Underscore Mexico Cartel Dominance. California seized a record amount of methamphetamine at ports of entry during the 2014 fiscal year, highlighting a trend that indicates Mexican cartels may be ramping up methamphetamine production. During the 2014 fiscal year, which ended on September 30, the San Diego US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) field office seized 14,732 pounds of methamphetamine, reported the San Diego Union Tribune. This figure -- which includes seizures at US ports of entry on California's border with Mexico as well as airport and seaport operations in the San Diego area -- represents 63 percent of all synthetic drug seizures at US ports of entry. According to CBP figures reported by the Union-Tribune, methamphetamine seizures at California ports of entry rose by 300 percent between fiscal years 2009 and 2013. In the last fiscal year alone, seizures of the drug increased by eight percent, while cocaine, marijuana, and heroin seizures dropped. A Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) assistant special agent told the Union-Tribune that Mexican cartels were ""flooding the US marketplace with their cheap methamphetamine"" and that the price of the drug has decreased ""tremendously"" since 2008. The increase in methamphetamine seizures at California ports of entry suggests that Mexican methamphetamine production is on the rise. DEA figures show that methamphetamine seizures increased not only in California, but along the entire southwest border between 2008 and 2012, while cocaine seizures dropped between 2011 and 2012. Additionally, plummeting methamphetamine prices suggest that increasing amounts of the drug are available on the market. This apparent rise in production could be the result of a number of different factors including crackdowns on methamphetamine production in the United States and the relatively low cost of producing methamphetamine in Mexico. In spite of stricter controls implemented in 2006, precursor chemicals are still likely easier to obtain in Mexico, where they can be smuggled in from Central America or Argentina , than the United States. S EE ALSO: Coverage of the US-Mexico Border It is also possible that the legalization of marijuana in two US states has pushed Mexican cartels to diversify their revenue streams in case more states follow suit and profits from marijuana trafficking decrease. Regardless of the reason for the spike in methamphetamine seizures, Mexican cartels appear to have taken over the US methamphetamine market. According to the US Justice Department's 2011 National Drug Threat Assessment , Mexico is the principal source of methamphetamine for the US market, and according to U-T San Diego, the DEA estimates that Mexico produces 90 percent of the methamphetamine consumed in the United States."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Zetas Staged Mass Breakout from Mexico Prison Before Massacre. Mexico's authorities are now saying a massacre at a Mexico prison was part of a sophisticated prison break involving guards. Thirty alleged members of the Zetas escaped, including ""El Arana,"" head of the Monterrey plaza. The governor of Nuevo Leon state, Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz, said that the government would pay a $785,000 reward (10 million pesos) for information on the location of the escapees from Apodaca prison. They are thought to include Oscar Manuel Bernal Soriana, alias ""El Arana,"" the boss of the Monterrey ""plaza,"" or drug trafficking territory. According to news website Frontera , the escape was carried out through an elaborate plan that enabled the 30 or so inmates to escape in just 20 minutes, with the killings taking place in the immediate aftermath when a group of Zetas inmates were allowed to pass, armed, to the block housing members of the rival Gulf Cartel. Initial reports suggested that prison staff had colluded in the attack, and these appear to have been confirmed with at least nine prison guards admitting to being complicit in the incident, according to state security spokesperson Jorge Domene. The director of the prison, along with several other officials and 18 guards, has been removed. Details have also begun to emerge on the identities of the dead with reports claiming most, if not all, belonged to the Gulf Cartel. The number of prisoners that fled remains unclear, however, with some putting the number at 30 and others at 33. The workings of this particular escape point to worrying levels of collusion between prison officials and the Zetas, and again shows that Mexico's authorities are not immune from taking sides in inter-cartel battles. This corruption can be traced back to institutional weaknesses in Mexico's penal system. With only six federal prisons throughout the country, many high-ranking, and highly dangerous, inmates are sent to state penitentiaries. Some state governors, like Nuevo Leon's Medina, complain of their inability to house such powerful criminals, as the Associated Press notes. The Apodaca escape is at least the second time in recent months that prison staff have been accused of being complicit in the escape of Zetas members, with at least 18 staff detained following the escape of 11 alleged members in the state of Puebla. A group of alleged Zetas were recaptured in a cartel training camp in Veracruz in October, after breaking out of prison the previous month. "	0	1	1	1	0	0	0
"How Will Trumps Pick for US Homeland Security Chief Impact LatAm?US President-elect Donald Trump has chosen retired Marine Gen. John Kelly to lead the US Department of Homeland Security. InSight Crime analyzes what positive and negative effects his appointment may have on the region. President-elect Trump will nominate Marine veteran John Kelly to take charge of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), people close to the presidential transition team confirmed to the Associated Press on December 7. The Senate would have to vote to confirm Kelly's appointment. Kelly's possible future position would have a key role in executing US national security decisions that directly affect Latin America. It is fitting that his last military post -- which he held from November 2012 until he retired in January 2016 -- was head of the US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), which leads US military operations in Latin America. As head of the DHS, Kelly would be responsible for counter-terrorism and national security, border management, enforcing immigration laws, and reacting to cyber threats and natural disasters. Among the department's many branches are Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Coast Guard and the Secret Service. Kelly's lead role in US national security could -- especially given the president-elect's emphasis on the threat posed by United States' southern neighbors -- significantly impact the US approach to the region. Firstly, Kelly would have a big say in implementing one of Trump's signature campaign promises: cracking down on unauthorized migration to the United States. Trump has pledged to combat this issue by building a wall on the US-Mexico border and deporting large numbers of ""criminals"" residing in the country without proper documentation. The mass deportation of immigrants could have dangerous consequences if executed, exacerbating security risks and damaging economic stability in the migrants' home countries. Many undocumented migrants in the United States have fled gang-related violence in Central America's Northern Triangle countries (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras). Today, 10 to 18 percent of these countries' gross domestic product depends on remittances. A sharp reduction in these transfers could worsen the socio-economic conditions that make these countries fertile ground for criminal groups. SEE ALSO : Coverage of US/Mexico Border But Kelly has until now adopted a somewhat different stance to the national threat posed by the influx of migrants, placing more importance on the economic development of Latin American countries over toughening border security. In his address to the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 2015 ( pdf ), Kelly said he was convinced that ""homeland defense does not begin at the 'one yard line' of our Southwest border."" Regarding Trump's proposed security policies, he has stressed that a wall alone is not a sufficient solution. ""If the countries where these migrants come from have reasonable levels of violence and reasonable levels of economic opportunity, then the people won't leave to come here,"" Kelly told the Military Times earlier this year. Indeed, when discussing his priorities in fighting organized crime in the Northern Triangle in 2015, he stated : ""95 percent of my efforts are not military. It's economic development."" Senior Associate at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) Adam Isacson told InSight Crime that ""Kelly understands that violence is a big driver of migration,"" and that he doubts the retired general will share Trump's support for aggressive deportation. Kelly's stance therefore suggests that he would be keener to tackle root causes of migration than aggressively tackle its consequences. Now that he has Trump's ear, he could try to moderate the future president's approach to regional migration. Alternatively, he may clash with Trump along with numerous other hardliners set to occupy top government positions. Nevertheless, Kelly's opinion on other matters may be a cause for concern. The retired general has warned on multiple occasions that Latin America could be a gateway for terrorists to infiltrate the United States. ""I am also troubled by the financial and operational overlap between criminal and terrorist networks in the region,"" Kelly told the Senate in 2015. While recognizing that the extent of this crime-terrorism nexus is ""unclear,"" he warned that terrorist groups -- like the Lebanese Hezbollah -- are involved in criminal activities in Latin America. Furthermore, Kelly explained that given the ""relative ease with which human smugglers"" bring thousands of people to the country's southern border, terrorist organizations could use the same routes to move in dangerous operators ""or even bring weapons of mass destruction into the United States."" But Kelly has been accused of overhyping a terrorist threat that has little foundation in reality. As InSight Crime has pointed out in the past , claims of a terrorist-crime nexus in Latin America are often based on one-off cases of criminal cooperation, and do not represent working relationships between such groups. Conflating terrorism and organized crime based on dubious theories is a potentially dangerous political tool that could be used to justify budget requests or controversial policy decisions -- such as who can or cannot enter the country -- while overlooking the real security risks facing Latin America. Other key policy decisions that could be swayed by Kelly's appointment include funding for the region. There are worries that Trump's ""America First"" rhetoric will mean handing out less foreign aid. This could have a significant impact on the Northern Triangle and on Colombia, which is currently preparing to set in motion a number of costly ""post-conflict"" projects in the wake of a peace deal with its largest guerrilla organization. However, Kelly's views on regional development and his gleaming praise of Colombia's ""phenomenal"" security turnaround suggest he will continue to advocate for financial support to Latin America. Kelly strongly endorsed a $750 million aid package to Central America approved in December 2015, and told the Senate last year that, ""We must sustain US support throughout [the Colombian peace] process and during the post-conflict phase as our closest partner works to end a decades-long insurgency."" Isacson agreed that the retired general may exert some positive influence in this regard. ""If Kelly hears concerns about Trump from defense and military colleagues in countries he admires (like Colombia), the result could be some moderation of the Trump administration's overall approach to the region,"" he said."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Sinaloa Cartel Operatives Face Death Penalty in Malaysia. A trio of Mexican brothers, thought to be Sinaloa Cartel operatives, await execution by hanging in Malaysia following a conviction on drug trafficking charges. Luis Alfonso, Jose Regino, and Simon Gonzalez Villarreal were arrested at a laboratory in 2008, where authorities say they found $15 million worth of methamphetamine. Lawyers for the Mexicans have maintained that they had nothing to do with the illegal drug production at the lab, but an appeal to have the conviction tossed out was denied earlier this week. The three brothers are natives of Culiacan, Sinaloa, a region with deep historic links to the drug trade. They had been lifelong brickyard employees, before receiving the offer to move abroad a little more than three years ago. ""I think they had no idea what they were getting into,"" Israel Gonzalez Villarreal, an older brother still living in Mexico, told the Associated Press. The brothers are thought to have been working for the Sinaloa Cartel , one of the most aggressive Mexican organizations in forming links to Asian suppliers of meth and precursor chemicals used in its production. The Gonzalez Villarreal brothers were not known as members of organized crime while in Mexico, though authorities say that it's not uncommon for relative novices to be placed in charge of meth labs, as the operation is relatively simple.

"Police Lethality in Brazil: Is There a Racial Bias?In the past two years, the killings by Brazilian police of young Afro-Brazilian men has reached record levels, with little attempt to address this phenomenon at either state or federal levels. Homicides in Brazil have reached a staggering 60,000 annually , according to the most recent monitoring report of the Brazilian Forum for Public Safety (Forum Brasileiro de Seguranca Publica). More than half of these are homicides of young men aged 15 to 29. The rate of young Afro-Brazilians killed is 37.5 per 100,000 people , while the rate for whites is 15.6. This article was originally published by the Washington Office on Latin America ( WOLA ) and is reposted with permission. It does not necessarily represent the views of InSight Crime. See the original here. Although the focus on homicide rates tends to be on Rio, the killing of Afro-Brazilians at the hands of police has increased most dramatically in the Northeast of the country. For example, in Recife, capital of the state of Pernambuco, white youth are killed at a rate of 13.9 per 100,000 people, while the rate of killings of black youth is 185. In Maceio, capital of the state of Alagoas, the rate is 24.3 for white youth and 327.6 for black youth. Throughout the country, but especially in Rio, as Amnesty International has pointed out, police are responsible for an alarming number of those deaths. This trend is confirmed by a Human Rights Watch report issued this July that notes Rio police have killed 8,000 people in the past decade, including at least 645 in 2015. Noting that many police killings involve the legitimate use of force, the report points out many others were extrajudicial executions. While these figures are alarmingly high, they are most likely an underestimate of figures for the country as a whole. Since the jurisdiction for the two main police organizations -- the Military Police and Civil Police -- are at the state level, the responsibility to furnish statistics varies from state to state. According to Samira Bueno , executive director of the Brazilian Forum for Public Safety, only half of the country's 27 states furnish credible and consistent data. While public safety policies differ from state to state and from one political moment to another, it is possible to point to national contextual factors that inform these general trends. First, the closed militarized structure and culture of the Military Police -- the uniformed, beat cop first responders -- reinforces the war-like mentality of the interaction between this force and low-income communities, despite innovations in training and the introduction of pilot projects to advance community policing. The notion of ""a good bandit is a dead one"" is shared by approximately 50 percent of the Brazilian population. Police justify the use of deadly force by transforming the victim into a criminal or by using the category ""resisting arrest"" as the rationale for killing. In a study of the police use of deadly force in Sao Paulo, Samira Bueno found that the category ""deaths due to law enforcement action"" was used to explain the 350 deaths by police in 2013 and 900 in 2014. Second, the insularity of the police institutions reinforces the impunity and permissiveness with which the police are allowed to operate virtually without oversight. The two institutions within the justice system that formally retain the right to police oversight, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Judiciary, are virtually absent as police overseers. The police ombudsman's office, a voluntary effort not present in all states, lacks independence and powers to investigate police killings. Third, the ascendancy of the political right in the past few years has reinforced the re-assertion of hardline public safety policies among a conservative Congress and in public opinion in general. In its 2015 Anuario , (annual report) the Brazilian Forum for Public Safety noted that the notion of ""a good bandit is a dead one"" is shared by approximately 50 percent of the Brazilian population. The current Congress is dominated by caucuses (bancada in Portuguese) known as the ""three Bs"" -- ""bancada da bala, bancada da Biblia, and bancada do boi."" That translates respectively as the ""bullet caucus,"" supported by the powerful gun lobby; the ""Bible caucus,"" supported by the large Evangelical caucus which is seeking changes in the definition of the family; and the ""beef caucus,"" supported by the agricultural land lobby. The first seeks reversals in Brazil's 2003 gun control statute, and is supported by the second two. In the context of the current impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Roussef, interim President Michel Temer has replaced the entire cabinet with conservative ministers. The new justice minister, Alexandre Moraes, when Secretary of Public Safety of the State of Sao Paulo, supported hardline policies and reversed the policy of transparency of public safety data. Within the national context of a move toward more hardline public safety policies, what measures could achieve needed reforms? There are currently several proposals to amend the Constitution with an aim to demilitarize the police and integrate the Military and Civil police forces into one organization. Integration would allow these two competing police forces with a long history of institutional rivalry to share information, intelligence, and strategies for more effective crime and violence reduction. Integration would also create a single career track to allow multiple functions, such as first responder and investigation, and the possibility of advancement within a single police organization. Given the current political climate, it may be more realistic to see the incremental changes presently being considered in Congress. Those include a law prohibiting police from shooting a fleeing suspect if the police are not in danger, and the removal of the category ""resisting arrest"" from the penal code. While these changes might have a greater chance of being implemented, there remains a great distance between formal law and actual practice. Approving these two latter changes would go a long way to reduce extrajudicial killings, but only if public safety officials in charge of state police organizations have the political will and courage to obey the laws and ensure accountability when they are broken. *This article was originally published by the Washington Office on Latin America ( WOLA ) and is reposted with permission.

Perus Shining Path Expand Reach, Ties to Drug Trafficking. The game of cat and mouse between the Peruvian security forces and the country's chief rebel group may be having the perverse effect of forcing the guerrillas into the arms of organized crime. The Shining Path, under pressure in their strongholds from army offensives, have spread out their forces and deepened their ties to drug trafficking, continuing to deliver their Communist message to the remoter hamlets and villages of the Peruvian highlands. An article in the Peruvian daily El Comercio looks at how the most belligerent of the two remaining Shining Path (or 'Sendero Luminoso' in Spanish) factions, led by aliases 'Jose' and 'Raul' (believed to be brothers with the surnames Quispe Palomino), has expanded its reach beyond the Apurimac and Ene river valley (Valle de los Rios Apurimac y Ene - VRAE) in the departments of Ayacucho and Apurimac, and been spotted in the department of Junin further north. The El Comercio article is complemented by another published in La Republica , dealing with an alleged money laundering network based around the VRAE, with links to the Shining Path, showing how the rebels tentacles are stretching out and interwining with organized crime. The VRAE is home to some of the densest cultivations of coca in Peru and the heart of much of the country's drug trafficking. Peru is seeing an increase in coca cultivation, as it threatens to dislodge Colombia from its position as the world's number one producer of cocaine. In 2008 coca production increased 4.5 percent while it dropped 18 percent in Colombia, according to United Nations figures. The U.S. government statistics (from the 2010 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report ) have Peru producing 225 tons of cocaine in 2009, compared with 270 tons in Colombia. The new reach of the Shining Path has also allowed the rebels to diversify the routes they use to smuggle cocaine out of the Peruvian highlands on their way down to the Pacific Coast, where shipments are bought by the Mexican drug cartels and smuggled northwards through the Pacific. The article reveals how the Shining Path rebels escort shipments across stretches of Peru, charging drug traffickers up to $30 a kilo. The rebel columns are not only marching through the mountainous terrain but have access to vehicles and are able to cover large distances quickly. Another effect of the army offensives against the rebels has been to force them to better arm and equip themselves, using the proceeds from drug trafficking to buy weapons on the black market.* Police intelligence sources are cited tracking more than 100 rifles (mostly AKMs, the upgrade of the basic AK-47 Kalashnikovs produced in the 1960s) and some rocket-propelled grenades used to target military helicopters, one of which was hit in 2009 in Santo Domingo de Acobamba (Huancayo province). While the Shining Path deepen their links with drug trafficking organizations, it seems they have not abandoned their ideology or political work.* There are regular seizures of Shining Path propaganda material, while the hammer and sickle is to be seen daubed on huts around the Upper Huallaga and VRAE. It is also clear that the Sendero faction in the VRAE is growing in strength and sophistication thanks to involvement in the drug trade, mimicking the position taken by both Colombian rebels groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ) and the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN ) The goverment has had some success against the Shining Path but principally against the faction entrenched in the Upper Huallaga Valley (in the northern department of San Martin, commanded by alias ' Artemio ' (whose real name is believed to be Florindo Eleuterio Flores), and not against those based in the VRAE. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Paraguay Seizes 25 Tons of Venezuela Currency. Paraguay has seized 25 metric tons of Venezuelan currency, an illustration of how this soon to be worthless cash is highly valuable to counterfeiters looking to convert it into US dollars. The stash of 50 and 100 bolivar notes was found hidden in bags at properties belonging to an arms dealer in the Paraguayan city of Salto del Guaira, on the Brazilian border, Reuters reported. Authorities are still evaluating the value of the seizure, as well as the motive behind the theft of such a huge quantity of currency. ""One possibility is that [the money] was used to acquire dollars in the Venezuelan black market, or that it would have been used to counterfeit dollars given the high quality of the paper used for Venezuelan bills,"" a police report states. Prosecutor Julio Cesar Yegros told Monumental AM that the cash apparently entered the country from Brazil. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced in mid-December 2016 that the 100 bolivar bill -- which until recently was the highest value banknote -- would be pulled from circulation. After numerous postponements, its withdrawal has been scheduled for February 20. Maduro said the removal of the 100 bolivar bill was meant to attack ""mafias"" in Colombia who were stashing cash in order to ""destabilize the Venezuelan economy."" On the surface, this seizure in Paraguay appears to give weight to President Maduro's cash hoarding theory. But the fact that the stash was found far from Venezuela only days before the 100 bolivar note will become worthless means it's more likely that the money was intended for counterfeiting purposes. With 100 bolivars worth a mere 3 US cents on the black market, the paper the money is printed on is of higher value to counterfeiters, who use it as raw material to print dollars. Given that a single US bill weighs approximately 1 gram , the potential value of the seized currency would be over $2 billion dollars, if all the bill were made into $100 bills. Although Paraguay may not stand out as a counterfeit currency hub -- like, for example, Peru -- there is evidence that such activities have been taking place for a number of years , especially in cities along the Brazilian border. It is also possible that the cash load was merely passing through this key transit country, facilitated by lax border enforcement."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
In Rare Find, Ecuador Discovers Coca Far From Colombia Border. Ecuador found a coca plantation miles away from the Colombia border where the crop is usually concentrated, suggesting that production levels may be increasing inside the country. An army patrol from the 19th Jungle Brigade discovered a total of four hectares of coca in Cuyabeno National Park in northern Ecuador, reports El Comercio. The coca was apparently planted in small plots in various locations. In one sector, the patrol unit also found weapons and*t-shirts bearing the colors of the Ecuadoran army. Small hectares of coca are usually found close to Colombian border, not deep inside Ecuadorian territory. Brigade commander Colonel Fausto Berrazueta told El Comerico that the 19th Jungle Brigade is responsible for monitoring a huge amount of ground, and thus he could not rule out the possibility that other coca plantations exist. He added that the army will begin searching for coca base laboratories in the area. Despite terrain and climatic conditions that make the country an ideal location for coca, Ecuador has so far avoided the kind of production levels seen in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. Instead, Ecuador is primarily a transit point for narcotics. In 2009, the Andean nation seized the second-highest amount of cocaine in South America, according to the UN's 2011 World Drug Report. However, this recent find in Cuyabeno, combined with last year's discovery of a 12-acre poppy field , suggest that the production of these illicit crops may be on the rise. If this is indeed the case, the country's authorities may be ill-equipped to deal with it, as Berrazeuta's comments implied. The recent US International Narcotics Control Strategy Report paints a bleak picture of Ecuador's institutional capacity to deal with organized crime, highlighting the country's porous borders, corruption, and an under-resourced military and police force. Though President Rafael Correra has deployed some 10,000 extra personnel to the northern border in an effort to tackle security concerns, the security forces reportedly fear that so far, such measures have been insufficient. If not addressed soon, they allegedly say , the country could be overwhelmed by drug trafficking and organized crime. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Chile Seizes $6.5M Bolivian Cocaine Base. Chile's police seized 137 kilos of Bolivian-produced base, a product refined to make cocaine, from a gang in the city of Rancagua, close to Santiago. Police said that the base could have been used to produce 400 kilos of cocaine , with a street value of three billion pesos ($6.5 million), and that the drug was intended for distribution in the capital and the south of the country. The seizure was the result of six months of investigative work. Police arrested two individuals and seized a rifle, a pistol, a number of vehicles, and 3.5 million Chilean pesos ($7,600). The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ranks Chile as a country with high cocaine use, with an annual prevalence of some 2.4 percent of the adult population consuming the drug. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Bulgarians Use Dakar Rally Truck to Smuggle Cocaine from Chile. Police in France have seized over a ton of cocaine smuggled from Chile in a Dakar rally vehicle by an international ring apparently led by Bulgarians, in another sign that Eastern European crime is deepening its involvement in cocaine trafficking. The 1.4 ton haul was discovered in spare tires on a Dakar rally support truck, which arrived by sea from the Chilean port of Valparaiso, reported La Tercera. Police arrested two Spaniards in France and two Bulgarians in Bulgaria in connection with the shipment. Police said an international network was behind the operation, and that the Bulgarians were the organizers, reported La Segunda. Chile has a reputation as one of the Latin American countries least affected by the drug trade, with some of the region's lowest indices of violence and corruption. However, it shares a border with two of the top three cocaine producing countries -- Peru and Bolivia -- and also has one of the region's highest cocaine consumption rates, meaning it is all but inevitable that cocaine corridors into Chile are opening up. Most of the cocaine that transits through Chile is moved on to Europe, and in the past several tons have been discovered in European ports on ships coming from Chile. This is also not the first time a Chile-France connection has been exposed. The ring behind this latest shipment appears to be an international coalition of drug traffickers, and as the cocaine was probably sourced from Peru or Bolivia it may not have involved more recognized major Latin American criminal organizations from the likes of Mexico or Colombia. The fact that the network appears to be led by Bulgarians supports the claims of European police force Europol in its 2013 drug trade report that an increasing number of criminals from Balkan countries are participating in the cocaine trade. The report notes how European groups have established a greater presence in South America in recent years, and tend to work through broad international networks of traffickers. Bulgarian organized crime groups, it says, have become involved in large-scale cocaine imports in association with Spanish, Italian and Colombian criminal organizations.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Mexico Govt: Police Mistook CIA Agents for Kidnappers. The Mexican government says the shooting of several CIA agents by Federal Police last month may have been an accident rather than a deliberate attack, but the incident still raises questions about the agency's competence. Mexican Interior Minister Alexandro Poire confirmed on September 4 that Federal Police attacked a diplomatic vehicle with CIA personnel and a Mexican marine captain inside because they may have mistook the occupants for suspects in a kidnapping case. The case, Poire said, was occurring in the exact area where the shooting took place. He added that the Attorney General's Office is still investigating. Poire refused to confirm that the agents, who were injured in the incident , were CIA personnel, although he did defend the presence of US government officials in Mexico. In an interview with El Milenio, the alleged victim of the kidnapping in question, Salvador Vidal Flores Perez, defended the police officers against accusations that they intentionally targeted the Americans and credited the Federal Police with saving his life. Proceso reported that an investigation by the Mexican Attorney General's Office discovered there were three CIA personnel inside the vehicle , rather than two, as was initially reported. Other sources continue to indicate that there were only two CIA personnel, and that both have already returned to the United States , despite the ongoing investigation by Mexican authorities. The news that the shooting was an accident rather than a deliberate attack by corrupt officials is certainly welcome, but the details that have emerged paint a picture of incompetence of the Federal Police involved. The Mexican marine captain who was in the vehicle during the attack reported that the officers, who opened fire on the car without verifying the identities of the occupants , were not wearing their uniforms and were traveling in unmarked, unofficial vehicles. As InSight Crime reported , this incident, along with a string of similarly embarrassing scandals such as the July shootout between different groups of police at the Mexico City airport , raises questions about the reliability of what is supposed to be Mexico's premier law enforcement agency. The CIA significantly increased its presence in Mexico last year , sending agents to work side by side with Mexican law enforcement and intelligence officials on Mexican military bases. -- Click here to send InSight Crime your comments.

Guyana Optimistic About Anti-Corruption Fight Although Resource Curse Looms. Guyanese citizens are optimistic about their country's progress in the fight against corruption, although Guyana still faces major challenges to prepare itself to manage its newfound oil wealth. Transparency International included Guyana in its Global Corruption Barometer for the first time this year, providing an important monitor of the country's situation in the run-up to the 2020 elections. The study reveals that 40 percent of Guyanese believe that corruption is decreasing, and 67 percent believe that the government is handling the struggle well. Reasons for their optimism include increased freedom of the media to criticize the government, the move to make petroleum contracts publicly available, and the dismissal of corrupt officials. Other policies praised by the report are the introduction of anti-money laundering laws and the creation of various agencies to monitor corruption in public life. Guyana has put fighting corruption at the top of its political agenda since the 2015 elections , when David Granger's APNU-Alliance for Change coalition defeated the People's Progressive Party (PPP) that had held power for 23 years. The PPP had become notorious for corruption cases involving members who used their political power to profit from state contracts and resources. Granger triumphed on a platform that promised investigations into corrupt officials and the creation of institutions to promote government accountability. However, Guyana has faced political uncertainty since Granger narrowly lost a no confidence vote in December 2018. After a lengthy court case found the vote valid, Granger was compelled to call new elections by March 2020. Guyana's positive perception of its corruption struggle is a welcome endorsement of Granger's agenda, despite his party's political woes. The approach taken by the incoming government will be crucial to this progress, particularly in the context of Guyana's status as the world's newest oil state. Guyana is poised to start commercial oil production in 2020, after ExxonMobil discovered vast oil reserves off the Guyanese coast in 2015. While the country's newfound riches offer great opportunities, its institutions are worryingly underdeveloped to manage such a windfall. Criticism of Granger's slow progress in setting up regulatory frameworks for oil production was a key justification for the 2018 no confidence vote. Four years after ExxonMobil's find, outdated petroleum laws and a lack of spending plans for projected oil revenue raise risks of severe mismanagement. But positive steps have been made. One of Granger's initiatives was the creation of the States Assets Recovery Agency (SARA), which is investigating oil leases sold to ExxonMobil and others, allegedly at knock-down prices and without due process. The outcome of this probe will be a litmus test of the agency's capacity to hold the industry accountable. The stakes are high. Neighboring Venezuela exemplifies the corruption and economic ruin associated with the so-called oil curse , suffered by countries that fail to manage resource wealth effectively. Venezuela also poses more direct challenges to the current and future Guyanese governments. The Maduro administration contests part of Guyana's oil fields, and has even sent gunboats to obstruct ExxonMobil's explorations. It also lays claim to the Guyanese border region, which is facing increasing security challenges from the influx of Venezuelan criminal groups.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Key Lieutenants Testimony Could Bring Tijuana Drug Lord to Justice. The guilty plea of a major Tijuana Cartel operative is an important achievement for U.S. law enforcement, but the real victory could lie in the information he provides against his former boss, Benjamin Arellano Felix. According to an FBI press release , Rigoberto Yanez Guerrero, alias ""El Primo,"" pleaded guilty Thursday to drug trafficking charges and membership in Mexico's Arellano Felix Organization, also known as the Tijuana Cartel, from 1995 to 2001. During that time he served as a ""go-between"" for the illicit network and Colombian cocaine suppliers. According to the press release, he supervised the maritime shipment of 5-10 tons of cocaine into the United States from Colombia, and was in charge of transmitting money to his suppliers in that country. Yanez was arrested in Mexico in March 2001, and extradited to the US in December 2010, according to U.S. Treasury documents. Yanez Guerrero is one in a long list of Arellano Felix Organization leaders to face jail time in the United States. Among them are Jesus Labra Aviles, alias ""El Chuy;"" Eduardo Arellano Felix, alias ""El Doctor;"" and Francisco Arellano Felix, alias ""El Tigrillo."" Most prominent is Benjamin Arellano Felix, the cartel's former strategic head, who currently awaits trial in the U.S. following the disqualification of his defense counsel on the grounds that he had represented a potential witness in the trial, according to media reports. Arellano Felix was arrested in 2002 in Puebla, south Mexico (see photo). Some observers have said that his extradition in 2007 was a way for Mexico to demonstrate its good intentions to the U.S. in the run up to the Merida Initiative military aid package. Unlike some jailed drug bosses, it appears that Benjamin Arellano Felix's control over the organization waned while he was in prison, with others taking over strategic control of the Tijuana Cartel in his absence. The current head of the group is Benjamin's nephew Fernando Sanchez Arellano, also known as ""El Ingeniero."" He appears to be running a much lower-profile organization, which is more disposed to make alliances with rival cartels than to fight it out. The timing of Yanez's plea is interesting. It comes in the run-up to the trial of Benjamin Arellano Felix, a deeply complex case which could last for several years, and will likely involve the multi-agency taskforces that hunted him. While Yanez's guilty plea is a victory for the U.S. Attorney's Office, its true importance may come in providing greater ammunition in the case against the real prize: Arellano Felix. Yanez is likely in a position to provide important evidence against his former boss. According to a 2003 indictment against the Arellano Felix Organization, Yanez was the primary representative of the Tijuana Cartel in Mexico City. He was in charge of drug shipments to Mexico that occurred outside Baja California, and served as the primary point of contact for Colombian cocaine suppliers wishing to do business with Ismael Higuera Guerrero, alias ""El Mayel."" These activities put Yanez in a key operational role for the Tijuana Cartel, which will likely allow him to provide detailed information about the activities and personal involvement of Arellano Felix in the group's activities. It is likely that Arellano Felix will make a plea bargain in order to avoid trial, and the recent plea of Yanez could send an important message to the capo; that the U.S. attorney's office has another critical former associate to testify against him, making it more likely that he will finally be brought to justice. If that happens, Arellano Felix would join a very small group of true kingpins -- he was the head of the organization, and not just a top lieutenant -- extradited to the United States, convicted of their crimes, and serving time in prisons they cannot control through corruption. While the conviction of Arellano Felix is unlikely to have an immediate effect on the operations of the Tijuana Cartel, it will send a message to other cartel heads in Mexico that extradition to the United States and conviction is a likely end to their criminal activities. This could make others more likely to turn themselves in in exchange for concessions, as many speculated that Edgar Valdez Villarreal, alias "" El Barbie ,"" did, following his arrest last year. Valdez was famously pictured grinning after his capture, leading to rumours that he had given himself up to the authorities in order to avoid being targeted by fellow drug traffickers.

"Bolivia: 85% Seized Assets Returned to Drug Traffickers. Eighty-five percent of goods seized from suspected narco-traffickers in Bolivia are later returned, according to a report by the government. Bolivia's Vice-Minister of Social Defense, Felipe Caceres, criticized the situation as a waste of ""the efforts and the risks run by our anti-narcotics police,"" reports Eju. Carceres said that the government was working on new legislation to tighten measures against drug trafficking with help from the United Nations. The law would mean that traffickers' assets will quickly be seized and sold, with he money passing into government coffers. ""We have to hit and to damage the assets of narco-traffickers, so that in this way every day their illegal activity will diminish,"" said the official. Bolivia's government also backed a plan, proposed at a anti-drug summit in Paris , where G8 countries along with narcotics-producing nations agreed to create an anti-drug fund using assets seized from traffickers.

"Guatemala Sees Drop in Homicides, but Criminal Threat Remains. While Guatemala saw a significant drop in homicides in the first seven months of 2012 compared to the previous year, the country continues to face a serious problem of violence and insecurity. Guatemala's national forensic institute, INACIF, registered 3,410 homicides between January and July of this year. This statistic is down 7.7 percent from the same period in 2011, when there were 3,695 murders, reports EFE. Seventy-seven percent of these crimes were committed with firearms, which is the same percentage as the previous year. In May, President Otto Perez announced that the country had seen an 18 percent drop in homicides in the first four months of this year compared to the same period in 2011. However, as InSight Crime pointed out , official police statistics put the drop closer to 2 percent. Although Perez's statistics may have been exaggerated, official reports do suggest that the homicide rate in Guatemala has been inching down over the past several years. Carlos Menocal, interior minister under former President Alvaro Colom, asserted in January that homicide rates fell by nearly eight per 100,000 inhabitants between 2008 and 2011, a claim that has been corroborated by both the National Police and crime analyst Carlos Mendoza. This does not, however, mean that Guatemala is ""winning"" the war against criminal gangs. Its proximity to Mexico and role in the routes used by traffickers to move narcotics between South and North America mean that the country continues to be important to organized crime. Despite Perez's promise to deal with drug trafficking with an ""iron fist,"" Mexican drug gangs like the Zetas continue to thrive in Guatemala. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Peru Army General Created 620 Phantom Soldiers. A Peruvian army general has been accused of making up 620 ""phantom soldiers"" to claim extra funding, an illustration of the endemic corruption that reaches the highest levels of the country's institutions. General Juan Quintana Briceno, who led the 3rd Brigade of Special Forces of Tarapoto in northern Peru, was taken into preventative custody ahead of his trial for falsely listing the imaginary soldiers as part of his unit in order to pocket their salaries, reported El Comercio. Meanwhile in a survey last month, 58 percent of Peruvians told Ipsos Peru corruption was the biggest impediment to the country's progress. Another 22 percent blamed inefficiency in state institutions and authorities, reported El Comercio. Nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said the political sector was more corrupt than any other part of society, and close to 40 percent believe the last two years have seen no progress in reducing corruption among state institutions. Respondents also cited law enforcement as a major issue, with a total of 91 percent saying Peru's laws are not respected. While corruption is an issue throughout much of Latin America, in Peru it is particularly entrenched right to the highest levels of government and state institutions, as demonstrated by General Juan Quintana's case. Another recent high-profile example is the ""pay-for-pardons"" scandal engulfing former President Alan Garcia, in which its alleged hundreds of drug traffickers bribed members of his administration to secure release from jail. In the last presidential elections, every major candidate faced some allegations of drug ties. However, as contradictory as it sounds, there may be a positive side to this. While Peru is now the world's largest cocaine-producing nation , it has not experienced the high levels of violent crime seen in places such as Colombia and Mexico. One theory is that as criminals do business with politicians and law enforcement unfettered, as well as with each other, they don't end up resorting to violence. This could even help explain why 78 percent of respondents to the Ipsos said they ""tolerated"" corruption. "	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Mass Graves Burying the Truth about El Salvador Gang Truce. Homicide levels, and more recently, clandestine mass graves, are driving the debate about the success or failure of the gang truce in El Salvador, but they are also obscuring some important truths about why the truce is steadily eroding and why its end has become almost inevitable. The latest mass graves unearthed are some of the worst this country has seen since the civil war. As many as 44 bodies have been found in Colon province, according to La Prensa Grafica. The head of the Office of Forensic Medicine (Instituto de Medicina Legal - IML) told the newspaper that he feared there may be many more. And the Attorney General's Office confirmed this, telling InSight Crime that there may be as many as eight more graves. The data coming from the police also seems to be in line with this fear. Disappearances doubled in 2013 , compared to 2012. To make things worse, there is a steady, upward creep in homicide levels. The truce, and the little political support it has left, are closely tied to these homicides, which did a remarkable nosedive following the signing of the agreement between the country's two most notable gangs, the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and the Barrio 18, in March 2012. The fear, and perhaps the reality, is that if they return even close to pre-truce levels, of between 12 and 14 homicides a day, that the process is officially over, according to one of the architects of the truce, Raul Mijango. ""That day the process would have failed,"" Mijango told El Faro. ""Because I would feel that we no longer had anything to do about it, because I would see that as the gangs losing the will they expressed when we began this process."" That day seems to be rapidly approaching. Even long time proponents of the truce, such as the journalist Paolo Luers , seems frustrated at the fissures appearing amongst the gangs, within the gangs, and between the gangs and the communities they pretend to suffer alongside. There are two big reasons given for this upward creep in murders and the emergence of the mass graves. The first is that the gang leadership can no longer hold their mid-level commanders in check and that fighting has renewed between, and, perhaps, within these gangs. The second reason is that the gangs have never really had a truce ; that they are using this opportunity to strengthen their political hand and their criminal enterprises. And while these are certainly important points to consider (and ones that InSight Crime has considered at length over the course of the truce), there are others that have been cloaked over by our almost singular focus on homicide levels, and now mass graves. What's more, this focus has essentially created a self-fulfilling prophecy that the truce will end. At its best, the truce is a window of opportunity, but one that might not come along again for a long time. These two gangs have shown they are consolidated and disciplined enough to reduce violence and shift emphasis towards where the debate in El Salvador needs to be: on the lack of social, economic and educational opportunity in the country (and indeed the region) that has played a role in their growth. They have not, as far as we know, asked for clemency or amnesty. They have spent months talking to each other, family members, gang leaders in other countries, government officials, politicians, journalists and multilateral representatives about what it may take to integrate gang-affected youth -- which could reach into the hundreds of thousands -- into society. There are some who have long seen the truce this way, chief among them the Organization of American States' (OAS) appointed representative in the talks, Adam Blackwell. While Blackwell can come across as naive (and I have had my public discrepancies with him), he has a fairly realistic approach to the truce: it is the best opportunity to lower the levels of violence. As he rightfully asks, what else has worked? The truce architects -- Mijango, the ex-guerrilla turned security advisor, David Munguia Payes, the ex-security minister and current Defense Minister, and the Catholic Bishop Fabio Colindres, who plays the role of chief legitimate promoter -- seem to be coming from the same place as Blackwell is now, even if they might not have started there (for the purposes of this article, let's leave aside the question of individual political ambitions). Their problem is that none of them has the political capital to pull in the needed players to make this feel real enough for the gang leaders or their mid-level commanders any more. Mijango and Munguia Payes have been sidelined ; Colindres is a second tier player in the Church hierarchy; the OAS is a weak institution with little credibility. And it is that lack of legitimacy that is contributing to the steady erosion of the truce and making its end a fait accompli. Those players are, in order of importance: the El Salvador President; the El Salvador Catholic Church; the United States Government. President Mauricio Funes' has never embraced the truce and not rejected it either. This dance has been infuriating for those close to the talks who understand that without him, there is little chance of lining up social, economic and educational assistance for gang-ridden communities. This position has also made the process opaque and exclusive, leaving out critical voices and actors who might have lent it more credibility. The irony is that the president cannot have it both ways: taking credit when murder rates drop, then running away (and appointing a security minister, and supporting an attorney general, who are all but openly sabotaging the truce) when violence creeps up again. His legacy will be, in part, based on the results of the truce, whether he likes it or not. Even worse, Funes' tepid stance is making it impossible to ""institutionalize"" the process. El Salvador is the midst of a tight presidential election this spring, and the candidates are rightfully running away from this unpopular pact amongst criminal groups. But if the new president did want to continue the process, through what institution would he channel his efforts? Who would be the interlocutor? What credibility would that person or institution have if it did not have months of formal and informal contacts, talks and interactions with the gang leaders? The Catholic Church has played a similarly ambiguous role. Top Church officials rejected overtures by Mijango at the beginning of the process, fearing the Church was being used as a rubber stamp of legitimacy. And, to a large degree, that sensation was justified when the architects chose Colindres, the military chaplain, to intervene in the talks. However, that was almost two years ago and the top officials, chief among Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez, are still acting like they were slighted and have been slamming the process. The Bishop's Conference needs to demand a seat at the table, even if it does not like the fact that a second tier bishop has gotten all the public attention thus far and appears to be the only one in the Church who believes all avenues towards peace need to be explored, regardless of possible pitfalls. What's more, the truce needs the Church, not one bishop. The Church offers infrastructure, working programs, access to communities and will lend the process a jolt of legitimacy. Without the Catholic Church hierarchy, public support for a negotiated solution will be impossible. Finally, the United States government has played a critical role in keeping the truce marginalized. Embracing the truce is a slippery slope, to be sure. The gangs have victimized thousands and recognition of this sort has bolstered more than one criminal group, helping it rise in power rather than diminishing or integrating it into more legal channels. And I am not suggesting it should take a strong, public position. But backchannels are available and could give the Presidency the confidence it needs to step up and accept a stronger role and invest some money in these faltering communities, as well as the business community, to provide the push needed to create economic programs. In addition, it is hypocritical to stand aside completely, especially when gang truces have happened in Los Angeles and other cities in the United States, and the US government is so strongly supporting Colombia's efforts to negotiate a settlement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). This is not about being naive about who the gangs are and what they did. Gang truces are nearly impossible to sustain , and this one carries more baggage than most. There need to be clear rules about what this truce is and what it is not, and consequences for those who choose to disregard those rules. However, there also needs to be a greater recognition that options are limited and opportunities are scarce. The truce is not perfect, but this is an opportunity that may not come again."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Venezuela Criminal Arsenals Widen to Include Grenades. Venezuela has seen the highest number of deaths and injuries from grenades in Latin America over the past three years, with corruption in the military making soldiers both a cause and target of this trend. The year 2015 was a record year for Venezuela in many aspects. In terms of citizen security, the country witnessed the highest homicide rates since its independence. The Venezuelan Violence Observatory (Observatorio Venezolano de la Violencia - OVV) recorded 27,875 victims, pushing the homicide rate to 90 murders for every 100,000 inhabitants and giving the country the second highest rate in the world after El Salvador for countries not at war. Within this total there were at least 47 deaths attributed to the detonation of grenades. The United Nations Regional Center for Peace, Disarmament and Development ( UNLIREC ) reported that hand grenade deaths increased by 194 percent during 2015 compared to the two previous years. Comparative figures are not available for the region, but Venezuela very likely maintains its position as the South American nation with the most grenade deaths, given that it held that distinction in 2014 with only 13 cases reported ( pdf ). The increase in grenade deaths has attracted the attention of the general public and international organizations. In looking for an explanation, Venezuelan officials have blamed corrupt military personnel for providing hardware from their arsenals to criminal gangs. This leakage of military weapons is not limited to grenades, but also rifles, ammunitions and mortar shells and as a result, the firepower of criminal gangs is increasing. Venezuela saw 84 cases involving the use of hand grenades in 2015, an average of 7 cases per month. And the trend seemed to accelerate over the course of the year, with the last six months registering an average of 9.6 cases. Grenade explosions resulted in 110 people being wounded; the highest count to date in Venezuela. The data does not account for people who may have died later from their grenade wounds. Press and other reports from the first quarter of 2016 indicate that the pattern is likely to hold this year. In an April 6 case, a grenade that detonated in a detention center in the northern state of Sucre killed six prisoners. On May 20, 25-year-old Sandra Zuelma Silva died after a mortar grenade detonated inside her house in the indigenous community of Nueva Esperanza, Apure state, on the Colombian border. National Guards reported finding two undetonated hand grenades at the scene. (See photo below) Authorities have not reported or have not been able to ascertain where the explosives came from. Police Superintendent Luis Godoy noted that it is very difficult to determine the origin of a grenade after it has exploded. At best, one might determine the brand, or even the batch the weapon belonged to and track down whether it was assigned to a particular military unit. UNLIREC's William Godnick has said that it is more likely the grenades used by criminals were sold on the black market by members of Venezuela's Armed Forces rather than brought into the country as contraband. Venezuelan officials, on the other hand, point to Colombia as a likely source. Anthony Daquin, a former security advisor to the president, and retired Maj. Gen. Edgar Bolivar, who served as chief of operations for the National Guard, said some of the grenades are probably smuggled to Venezuelan criminal groups by Colombian guerrillas. The Venezuelan regime is currently accompanying both of Colombia's main guerrilla groups in the peace talks with the Colombian government. Venezuela's security forces did little about the increasing reports of grenade use until criminals began using them to target police officers and soldiers, and even barracks and police stations. A series of five such cases occurred over a two day period in September 2015. In one particular attack, two grenades were thrown at police at a pedestrian checkpoint in Baruta, a municipality that is part of Caracas metropolitan area. Eight agents were wounded by shrapnel, and one was left in a coma. Some officials have characterized the attacks on security forces as a backlash against the government's ongoing crackdown on criminal gangs, known as Operation Liberation and Protection of the People (Operacion Liberacion y Proteccion del Pueblo - OLP), but two of the targets of these attacks had no discernable connection to OLP. A confidential report by the Terrorism Investigation Division of Venezuela's investigative police, the CICPC, noted that the grenades used in these attacks were similar in make and model to those supplied to the military and the National Guard. The document also confirmed that during military exercises ""these explosive artefacts are supplied in an irregular fashion and are subsequently sold on the black market."" Security expert Daquin warned that the increase in national military exercises during the past few months could result in more military explosives in the hands of civilians. The training and preparedness operations entail major military deployments and widespread engagement with the civilian population. ""What better moment to distribute these types of weapons than with the so-called exercises,"" Daquin said. Sandra Zuelma was killed by a mortar explosion in her rural community the same day the nationwide Independence II 2016 military exercise commenced. The operation was followed by joint exercises known as Patria Chavista. Those exercises are based on a scenario of popular resistance supported by regular forces. In both activities, military equipment is entrusted to community defense councils. The military conducts periodic campaigns exhorting personnel to carefully guard and account for their arsenals. However, the grenade attacks on police prompted the commander of the National Guard, Gen. Nestor Reverol, to recently acknowledge in an internal document that ""there has been loss of armament, optical and optoelectronic devices, accessories and ammunition of different calibers, which indicates the complicity of some forces with unscrupulous people."" There is reason to believe that criminals now have even more firepower than just guns and grenades. In February 2016, a shootout with police ended with the authorities recovering an AT4 anti-tank bazooka from inside a stolen Land Cruiser (see photo above). With military complicity suspected in black market arms deals, police are left wondering how long they have before their own stations come under high-powered attack."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"China Fentanyl Ban Yet to Hamper Mexicos Crime Groups. Authorities in Mexico continue to make large seizures of the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl, even as China, the world's top producer of the drug, tightens regulations. Mexico's armed forces seized almost 24 tons of fentanyl at the Pacific port of Lazaro Cardenas in southwest Michoacan state on August 26, Excelsior reported. Authorities discovered the drug on a Danish-flagged vessel that had left China. The ship's cargo manifest identified the product as calcium chloride, but the substance in fact tested positive for fentanyl after authorities performed a random sampling test, according to Excelsior. The shipment was destined for Sinaloa, just up the coast to the north. Mexico has seen a string of seizures of synthetic drugs and their precursor chemicals during the month of August. At the start of the month, customs officials at the international airport in Mexico City detected a shipment of two kilograms of precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl. Later on August 8, federal police in Baja California state, along the US-Mexico border, seized 4,000 fentanyl pills and more than 16 grams of synthetic drugs presumed to be methamphetamines, according to an official press release. One kilogram of fentanyl costs about $32,000, which can be used to make one million pills with a street value of more than $20 million, according to law enforcement officials. Yet just two milligrams of the drug is a lethal dose for most people, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ). China accounts for the vast majority of illicit fentanyl and its precursor chemicals that reach the United States. US officials have pressured the country to crack down on the drug's production. In April of this year, officials in China banned all variants of the powerful opioid in an effort to cut off supply. Continued large seizures of fentanyl in Mexico show that the Chinese ban has not yet hampered the supply line of the Mexican groups ferrying the opiate north to the United States. The ban was aimed at stopping Chinese manufacturers from exploiting a loophole that allowed them to change the molecular structure of the drug in such a way that it was not explicitly banned. ""Organized crime groups have effectively circumvented initial controls by basically creating new yet-to-be-controlled versions,"" one United Nations expert told the South China Morning Post last year. But China's vast chemical and pharmaceutical industry continues to be a source of illicit fentanyl. Of around 5,000 pharmaceutical manufacturers, regulators in China only actively monitor a small fraction, according to research by the Rand Corporation think tank. As InSight Crime reported in a detailed investigation done in collaboration with the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Sinaloa Cartel and Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion -- CJNG) -- Mexico's most powerful criminal groups -- are largely responsible for importing and producing illicit fentanyl and its precursors. The port of Lazaro Cardenas in Michoacan, where the latest seizure took place, is one of the key entry points for these products into the country. This is also one of the ports that President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador recently said was under the control of organized crime groups. (Graphic c/o InSight Crime 2018 Fentanyl Report) The US mailing system has been exploited for smaller fentanyl shipments , but mass movement of the drug to the United States is largely through criminal groups in Mexico. As the country's criminal landscape has grown increasingly fractured , organizations like the CJNG and Sinaloa Cartel have come to rely on subcontractors to facilitate their trafficking operations. Growing demand for synthetic drugs in the United States, which is currently in the grips of a vicious opioid crisis that saw fentanyl overdose deaths exceeded those from heroin for the first time in 2016, has even driven shifts in illegal drug production in Mexico. Farmers who used to earn a living by growing poppy for the heroin trade have seen a sudden drop in prices and demand for their illicit crops."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Why Success of Mexicos Oil Security Plan May Not Matter. A Wilson Center report says Mexico's efforts to improve security in two states containing major oil and gas reserves may yield only short-term results and primarily benefit foreign business, while ignoring long-term efforts to improve citizen security. The report (pdf) identified Veracruz and Tamaulipas as Mexico's most important states in terms of hydrocarbons development. Both states hold a major portion of the country's oil and gas deposits, including offshore oil sites in the Gulf of Mexico and shale gas formations similar to those already being successfully developed in the US. The states also house significant refining assets and some of Mexico's largest ports with direct sea routes to US energy hub Houston, Texas. Following Mexico's energy reforms last August , a host of foreign firms have lined up to enter this newly opened market. Several firms have even revealed investment plans of a billion dollars or more, a recent Financial Times report said. Veracruz and Tamaulipas are expected to receive much of this investment. On top of expected exploration investment, the Mexican government is seeking foreign funding for a major gas transportation network in Veracruz and several petrochemical plants. Meanwhile a series of anticipated hydrocarbons export projects are set to ""put Tamaulipas on the map as Mexico's most important energy state,"" the Wilson Center said. However, Veracruz and Tamaulipas are also home to two of Mexico's most powerful criminal organizations, the Zetas and their former progenitors in the Gulf Cartel. The two have been at war since 2010, making Veracruz and particularly Tamaulipas brutal places to live and operate a business. Tamaulipas, for instance, has the highest reported kidnapping rate in Mexico, the kidnapping capital of the world. Both organizations have diversified their revenues by illegally siphoning hydrocarbon products from Pemex's sprawling network of oil and gas pipelines, and selling it domestically and abroad. Veracruz and Tamaulipas suffer the highest rate of siphoning incidents out of all Mexican states, the Wilson Center said. The problem goes beyond those states. Illegal siphoning incidents have grown steadily across Mexico from 296 registered in 2008 to 4,127 in 2014, Pemex executive Francisco Fernandez Lagos told El Universal in a recent interview. Pipeline breaches in 2014 cost Pemex over $1.3 billion in stolen product, repairs and clean up, Lagos added, calling the issue a ""national security threat."" (See registered breaches from 2013 from Wilson Report below) As well-financed and technically-savvy organizations, the Zetas and Gulf Cartel are particularly suited to exploit the company's weaknesses. Both organizations have the money and muscle to bribe or intimidate oil workers into revealing pipeline network vulnerabilities. Those same assets are used to dissuade local government and security personnel from interfering in oil theft operations. Criminals also reportedly operate extensive infrastructure including a fleet of tanker ships, oil trucks and cartel-controlled gas stations, the Wilson Center report said. On top of stealing oil and gas, the Zetas and Gulf Cartel directly threaten oil company personnel with kidnapping and often extort ""narco-rents"" from companies operating in their areas of influence. The two groups have also been known to destroy oil and gas infrastructure and block transportation routes, attempting to force financial losses on each other's black market fuel operations. The Zetas and Gulf Cartel's violent competition has indirect effects on Veracruz and Tamaulipas' oil and gas industry. The organizations regularly set up ""narco-blockades"" to capture and assassinate each other's members. These blockades have stopped oil trucks from reaching refineries and even shut down Tamaulipas' Altamira international airport for a period in 2014, the Wilson Center report said. Eager to avoid incidents that could scare off foreign firms -- such as when Gulf Cartel members opened fire on a hotel housing employees of Swiss oil services firm Weatherford -- the Mexican government has announced new security plans in the two states. In May, President Pena Nieto revealed Plan Tamaulipas, which will divide the state into four quadrants controlled by special army and navy units. The units are specifically directed to dismantle the criminal groups and their operations, and patrol against narco-blockades. Under what's called the "" mando unico ,"" or ""single command,"" Tamaulipas' local police have been subsumed into a single state force. The state has also received 200 units of the recently formed Gendarmerie security force, whose directives include protecting strategic regional industries. Similar efforts are underway in Veracruz, which also consolidated its police forces under mando unico. The new force is to receive about $8 million in federal money to help police combat organized crime through better training and equipment. Additionally, the government will place some 1,800 Gendarmerie members in Veracruz ""in the near-term,"" the Wilson Report said. The Wilson Center's prediction of short-term improvement but little lasting security progress in Veracruz and Tamaulipas is likely to prove prophetic. While Pena Nieto has talked of new organized crime fighting methods, in practice his actions look very similar to the military-reliant strategies of his predecessor. Critics say the Gendarmerie, for instance, has more to do with politics than actual security reform. In the end, no security measure focused on troop build-up addresses the issue of corruption within Pemex and local governments, or the perennial question of judicial reform and the need to strengthen the country's penitentiaries. ""Corruption, bribes, and extortions remain an intractable problem for Pemex, and regional governments,"" the Wilson Center report said. What's more, the Wilson Center report glosses over a key part of the criminal story: atomization. The Zetas and the Gulf Cartel are both going through a near constant restructuring due to their inter-cartel rivalry and the increasing presence of state forces in their areas of operation. The resulting fragmentation will make for even more dependence of these smaller, disperse criminal groups on low-tech crimes such as hydrocarbon theft and extortion. The irony is that -- depending, of course, on the price of oil -- none of this may matter to oil investors. While multinational oil firms would prefer stable operating environments, they are no stranger to conflict zones and have experience in mitigating risks and violence, and are willing to pay a lot of money for private security. The prospect of supplying Mexico and neighboring energy-consuming giant the US will likely counter any security concerns, especially if prices return to pre-2014 levels. ""It will be bumpy for sure, but it will be absolutely fantastic,"" oil major BG Group executive Sami Iskander told the Financial Times. Worse case scenario is that an increase in oil investment and production draws more criminals to the region. In that scenario, Veracruz and Tamaulipas citizens might bear the brunt of the crime without enjoying the benefits of the investment."	0	0	1	0	0	1	0
"Guatemala Announces Heroin Poppy Crop Substitution Program. Guatemala 's interior minister has announced plans for a crop substitution program for poppy farmers, suggesting the government will take a more integrated approach to fighting the country's production of the plant, which is used to manufacture heroin. The plan, titled ""Substitute Cultivation"" (Cultivo Substituto), will target regions such as the mountainous province of San Marcos, on the Mexican border, which is the the epicenter of the country's opium poppy trade, reported Prensa Libre. The announcement comes just days after the start of a major eradication operation in San Marcos. Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla added that the government has detected the presence of Mexican groups who pay farmers to use part of their land to grow poppy in areas with little police presence. According to the US State Department , Guatemala is the second-largest producer of poppy in Latin America, with some 1,000 hectares cultivated in 2011. Compared to the region's largest producer, Mexico , which has an estimated 15,000 hectares of illicit poppy under cultivation, the poppy trade in Guatemala is minor, but there are concerns that production is growing. According to a 2011 International Crisis Group report, "" Guatemala: Drug Trafficking and Violence ,"" poppy farmers in Guatemala are able to harvest more poppy plants per hectare than growers in other countries. Poppy grown in San Marcos is typically shipped over the border to Mexico, where it is processed into heroin and then trafficked to the United States. The government claimed to have destroyed over $300 million worth of poppy crops in San Marcos in a single week in May 2012, part of $1.3 billion worth of drug crops destroyed in the first half of that year. Recently the Guatemalan government has turned to a militarized strategy to confront the drug trade and organized crime in poppy producing regions. Earlier this year, Guatemala announced the deployment of the newly created Mountain Special Operations Brigade to San Marcos in an attempt to combat the poppy trade in the province. The decision to deploy the new elite military unit follows the withdrawal of the National Police from more than half the province's municipalities, and the announcement of the creation of a new military base there. The planned crop substitution program demonstrates the government at least recognizes the need to implement an integrated drug strategy that does not focus on eradication alone. President Otto Perez has also indicated he is considering a more radical approach to poppy cultivation. Speaking at a press conference at the World Economic Forum earlier in January, Perez raised the possibility of legalizing poppy cultivation in northern Guatemala for legitimate uses."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Arrest of Panama Drug Boss Shows Gangs International Ambitions. A binational operation has reportedly disbanded one of the most wanted criminal organizations in Panama, exposing an intricate drug trafficking network that suggests local gangs could be making the leap into transnational organized crime. On September 6, Panamanian authorities and Colombian police captured one of the most wanted men in Panama, Hector Moises Murillo Barberena, who was known by various aliases including ""Moi,"" ""El Pulpo,"" and ""El Viejo."" A statement by Colombia's National Police said the 40-year-old was the leader of the gang Kill the Nasty, and had close ties to top figures in the Colombian criminal organization the Urabenos including Dairo Antonio Usuga, alias ""Otoniel,"" Roberto Vargas Gutierrez, alias ""Gavilan,"" and Carlos Antonio Moreno Tuberquia, alias "" Nicolas ."" According to El Tiempo , authorities established that the Urabenos supplied cocaine to Kill the Nasty by shipping it from Colombia's Pacific coast to Panama. Kill the Nasty would then coordinate with Mexican organizations to move the drugs out of the Central American country, the news outlet reported. During an eight month investigation code-named ""Operation Omega,"" 10 cocaine shipments were intercepted in Panama, totaling over 4 metric tons. Investigators found that illicit cargo entering Panama would be transported to the ports of Balboa, Manzanillo, Colon and Cristobal, where it was then smuggled to Mexico, the United States and Spain. Murillo was arrested along with 18 other suspected members of the drug trafficking network. Among those arrested were suspects identified by the aliases ""Jeimar"" and ""Betty"" -- Colombian nationals whom the police said provided cocaine to Murillo's organization. Two Indian citizens were also arrested for allegedly laundering Kill the Nasty's illicit earnings, while a Panamanian identified as ""M.M."" was accused of bribing authorities to evade controls. Colombian authorities also reported confiscating two firearms, 14 properties and 150 cars. El Tiempo reported that the group used a car dealership as a front company. Murillo had previously been detained in Panama in February 2012 for the killing of a teacher during a gang shootout. However, he was released in June 2015 after his detention was declared invalid in a court ruling described as suspcious by Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. In 2014, local media reports stated that Kill the Nasty had been dismantled following the capture of the gang's alleged leader Jorge Zurita, alias ""Pibe."" At the time, authorities said the group was carrying out drug trafficking activities in collaboration with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) guerrilla organization. Murillo's arrest illustrates several aspects of the evolution of local criminal dynamics in Panama. Over the past few years, the country's street gangs, known as ""pandillas,"" have been consolidating into two main rival blocs: ""Bagdad"" and ""Calor Calor."" Kill the Nasty is one of a number gangs operating in Panama, and some reports suggest it is a faction of Calor Calor. The description of Murillo's criminal network appears to confirm previous reports suggesting that Panamanian criminals are running so-called "" oficinas de cobro, "" or collection offices. These organizations offer services such as protection of drug routes and contract killings for other criminal groups, and act as a bridge between Colombian criminal organizations like the Urabenos and traffickers who move drugs to subsequent destinations, according to a 2014 report from the National Criminal Statistics System (Sistema Nacional Integrado de Estadisticas Criminales - SIEC) of Panama's Public Security Ministry. However, the extensive network uncovered by Operation Omega raises the question of whether Panamanian groups continue to act merely as service providers for Colombian and Mexican criminal organizations, or whether they have begun to set up their own transnational trafficking operations."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Impact of Colombias Cocaine Boom Hits the US: DEA. Cocaine use and availability is on the rise in the United States for the first time in nearly a decade, according to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), as the production boom in Colombia begins to be felt on US streets. The DEA's 2016 National Drug Threat Assessment states that data from seizures and overdose deaths suggests that the amount of cocaine reaching US shores increased from 2014 to 2015, marking the first such rise since 2007. Seizures are at the highest levels since 2010, increasing by 56.7 percent between 2014 and 2015, marking the first year on year rise since 2012. Cocaine overdose rates, meanwhile, reached 5,415; the highest number since 2007 and a 9.5 percent increase on 2014. The reason for the increase, according to the DEA, is an estimated 67 percent spike in cocaine production in Colombia, which continues to dominate the US market. DEA testing of seized shipments showed that 90.2 percent of cocaine that reached the United States originated in Colombia, 7.5 percent from Peru, and 2.5 percent was of unknown origin. However, even the Peruvian cocaine sold mostly appears to have passed through Colombia, with forensic analysis showing all but 1 percent of it had signatures consistent with being processed from coca base to powdered cocaine hydrochloride within Colombia. Mexican cartels continue to control most of the trafficking into the United States, although Colombian networks still supply wholesale quantities to East Coast markets, according to the DEA. Both the Mexicans and the Colombians rely on US criminal networks and street gangs for mid- and retail-level distribution as they seek to limit their exposure to US law enforcement. However, some Colombian and Dominican organizations still participate in distribution along the East Coast. The main route cocaine takes into the US continues to be through Central America, with approximately 76 percent transiting along the Eastern Pacific, compared to 14 percent through the Western Caribbean and 9 percent through the Eastern Caribbean. Despite numerous reports in recent years of an increase in trafficking through the Caribbean, the DEA noted a slight decrease in the percentage of cocaine moved along this corridor. Most of the cocaine then crosses into the United States through the Southwest Mexican border, before moving to transshipment hubs cities in California, Arizona and Texas. From there, the drugs are transported along interstate highways to other hub cities such as Atlanta, Chicago, and New York. Other shipments arrive in the country through Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic before reaching Miami or New York. Other trends identified by the DEA include the emergence of cocaine mixed with fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. While fentanyl is more commonly mixed with or sold as heroin -- a practice that the DEA says surged in 2015 -- there have also been cases of seized cocaine/fentanyl mixes and several reported overdoses from people taking a cocktail of both substances. The increase in cocaine trafficking is set to continue, the DEA says. Cocaine production in Colombia spiked dramatically in 2015, and due to the lag time between coca cultivation and cocaine distribution, this cocaine is unlikely to reach the United States until late 2016 and beyond. ""As TCOs [transnational criminal organizations] make a concerted effort to increase the supply of cocaine in the United States, the United States can expect to see increased cocaine seizures, new cocaine users, and cocaine-related deaths. An increase in supply may lead to an increase in retail-level purity and a decrease in price to attract more cocaine users,"" the report warns. The DEA's report is one of the first indicators that Colombia's cocaine production boom is starting to have an effect on the retail end of the supply chain. The US government estimates that Colombia produced 420 metric tons of cocaine in 2015 -- a 68 percent rise on the previous year, while the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates estimates it produced 646 tons -- a 46 percent rise. However, the situation is likely far more dire than even these figures suggest. If the figures are compared with seizures within Colombia then either Colombia is seizing an unfeasibly high percentage of the cocaine produced in the country, or the figures are a gross underestimate. As noted by the DEA, the production to sale time lag means that the rise recorded in this year's DEA report does not take this recent spike into account, and is instead a reflection of the smaller, but still substantial increase seen in 2014. When the cocaine produced in 2015 begins to hit the streets in the United State then the trend of increasing cocaine trafficking and use in the United States will likely not only continue but accelerate. Whether this becomes a long term pattern or not could largely hinge on how Colombia handles the coming demobilization of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) and the implementation of the peace accords negotiated with the guerrillas. The FARC are the custodians of approximately 70 percent of Colombia's coca crops, taxing production, trading in coca base and in some cases trafficking the processed cocaine themselves. The rebels are now preparing to withdraw from the drug trade as they demobilize, while the state is set to carry out a coca eradication and crop substitution program as part of the peace agreement. The demobilization of the FARC presents Colombia with a golden opportunity to reduce cocaine production by moving into the areas left by the departing the guerrillas and offering the farmers a legal alternative to coca cultivations. However, numerous serious obstacles remain. Factions of the FARC may decide not to walk away from their lucrative illegal businesses and instead criminalize. Even in areas where the FARC do withdraw, there are already signs that other criminal networks are taking over their business and ensuring the product keeps flowing. In addition, the Colombian government does not have a good record implementing crop substitution programs and will need to improve on past efforts if it is to make a serious impact. If Colombia cannot meet these challenges then, as the DEA states, ever more cocaine is poised to flood into the United States."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Entire Police Forces Continue to be Arrested in Mexico. The arrest of a town's entire police department in Mexico's state of Chihuahua reflects just how insidious police corruption continues to be in the country, with governments at all levels seemingly unable to make any real difference. Fifteen police officers from the municipality of Madera, Chihuahua, in northern Mexico, were arrested on August 15 during a joint operation by state and federal agencies, the Chihuahua Attorney General's Office reported. Madera's police commander was among those arrested. Identified only as Jose Luis M. M., he had apparently provided protection services to drug traffickers in the area and obstructed the work of local authorities. The arrest occurred after the police chief stopped operatives from state security agencies and threatened them at gunpoint to abandon an investigation in the region. Entire police forces being rounded up for corruption and collusion with organized crime is nothing new in Mexico. In August 2018, 205 police officers were disarmed and suspended in the municipality of Tehuacan in central Puebla state, while 113 more were believed to have fled. The ease with which corruption spreads inside the police forces and the vast impunity for participating officers means that successive government reforms have shown no concrete results. An average of 1,688 corruption cases were registered for every 1,000 active-duty police officers in Mexico in 2017, according to a survey conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). That translates to 1.6 acts of corruption for every police officer at the national level. The state of Chihuahua reported that for every 1,000 police officers registered in the state, 133 had been participating in criminal activities. The state's corruption rate is only surpassed by Mexico City, with a rate of 179 for every 1,000 police officers. Mexican police forces are particularly vulnerable to corruption and infiltration by drug cartels, due to low salaries and a lack of government support. This makes the bribes paid by criminal mafias extremely attractive. ""It is far easier to develop training programs and improve selection criteria than to reverse a long history of extortion and bribery,"" investigator Daniel Sabet was quoted as saying in a report published by the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). Each new government in Mexico has proposed a new way to address the issue of police corruption, and it seems that none have been effective. In fact, there have been repeated protests by police forces t hat have been invited to be part of the new National Guard force enacted by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. According to federal police, the new law enforcement entity would not respect severance, hierarchy nor seniority."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Crime and Security High on Voters Agendas in Brazil Election. Brazil is just days away from the first round of this year's general election, and rising crime and security will play an important role in shaping the outcome of the contest, which in turn will help shape how the country confronts the deteriorating security situation. Polls leading up to the election have consistently shown that violence is one of the most pressing issues for Brazilian citizens. A September survey by the research firm Datafolha found voters consider violence to be the country's second-most important problem, after the crisis-wracked healthcare system. Brazilians have reason to worry. The national murder rate has been ticking upwards in recent years, reaching an all-time high of 30.8 homicides per 100,000 citizens in 2017, according to a recent report by non-profit Brazilian Public Security Forum (Forum Brasileiro de Seguranca Publica). There are many factors behind the deepening insecurity. Economic struggles have hurt local governments' ability to spend on public safety, turf wars between gangs have led to repeated outbreaks of bloodshed, and a lack of political will has hindered efforts to revamp flawed policies. Much attention has been focused on Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's second-biggest city. Earlier this year, President Michel Temer ordered the federal military forces to assume control over security operations. Critics allege the decision was taken for purposes of political posturing in an election year rather than as a genuine attempt to improve public safety. However, Brazil's more rural and less wealthy northern regions are even worse off. Homicide rates have been rising at a much faster pace in northern states like Pernambuco, Ceara and Rio Grande do Norte than in the more urbanized south. In these areas, security may play an even bigger role in voters' choices at the polls in October. It's clear from the campaign rhetoric and media coverage that security is a big theme in this election. And experts agree that many Brazilians will base their decision at the voting booth in large part based on that issue. ""The issues of violence and crime are among the most discussed in this election, as they are one of the main concerns of voters. So, certainly many people will decide their vote based on which candidate they think is most capable of solving the question of rising violence,"" said Aline Burni, a political science PhD candidate at Minas Gerais Federal University in Brazil. Burni credits the preoccupation with violence for aiding the rise of far-right, law-and-order firebrand Jair Bolsonaro, currently the frontrunner in the presidential race. ""Bolsonaro's approach is explicit: that crime should be combatted through force and that he is going to invest on the side of armed repression, including with measures to enhance the stature of the police,"" Burni told InSight Crime. ""In Brazil, there isn't a culture of mainstreaming human rights, so the discourse of 'a good criminal is a dead criminal' appeals to a lot of people."" Hard data seems to support this conclusion. According to the above-mentioned Datafolha poll, voters who support Bolsonaro consider violence the principal problem in Brazil. Those who support other candidates, like the leftist former mayor of Sao Paulo, Fernando Haddad, rank it behind healthcare. Burni thinks security issues will have a bigger impact on the presidential election than it will on congressional races. ""Voters see the president as the actor that has more power to make drastic changes and the question of violence requires urgent measures,"" she said. ""But as a function of the rules and dynamics of electoral propaganda the vote for members of congress depends more on personal proximity -- the endorsement of well-known figures or other politicians -- than on the platform they promote."" The leading presidential candidates have wildly varying ideas about how to address crime and violence, meaning this election could spur a profound shake-up in Brazil's security strategy going forward. ""The two rivals that are leading the race, Haddad and Bolsonaro, have totally opposite views on how to resolve the question of insecurity in the country,"" Burni pointed out, contrasting Haddad's focus on human rights and crime prevention to Bolsonaro's heavy-handed focus on repression and punishment. ""In this sense, as a function of who is elected, there could be a drastic change in the framework of security policy going forward,"" Burni said."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"US Report on Alternative Drug Smuggling Tactics Undermines Border Wall Logic. A new US government report on lesser-used drug trafficking techniques such as tunnels and ultralight aircraft further undermines claims that building a border wall will halt the flow of illegal drugs into the country. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report released May 1 analyses the extent of several lesser-used drug smuggling methods that have arisen in response to increased security on overland routes, and it assesses the efficacy of attempts to combat them. The study focuses on underground tunnels, ultralight aircraft and maritime smuggling using open-hulled ""panga"" boats and recreational vessels. Analyzing data from 2011 to 2016 from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the GAO identified a total of 67 cross-border tunnels, 534 ultralight aircraft incursions and 309 incidents involving panga or recreational boats during that period. However, the report notes, the data suggests a general decline in the use of these tactics over that timeframe. For example, the number of tunnels discovered by DHS dropped by half, from 18 in 2011 to just nine in 2016. (See GAO graphic below) The types of tunnels analyzed vary from sophisticated and lengthy structures with electricity, ventilation and even railways, to rudimentary short and shallow holes. Tunnel discoveries have been clustered around the southwest border, with over 90 percent made in the sectors of Tucson, Arizona or San Diego, California. Out of the 23 seizures made in connection with these tunnels, 21 of them involved marijuana. The number of ultralight aircraft incursions registered by DHS dropped even more dramatically, from nearly 200 in 2011 to less than 30 in 2016. (See GAO graphic below) The use of ultralight aircraft was also concentrated along the southwest border, with all but one incident taking place in either California, Texas, Arizona or New Mexico. As with the tunnels, the aircraft were predominantly used to move marijuana, which accounted for 98 percent of associated seizures. The preference for marijuana is likely a result of the fact that most pilots work as subcontractors for drug traffickers and are financially responsible for the load, the report notes. If, for example, a pilot lost 100 kilograms of cocaine, it would cost him much more than losing a 100 kilograms of marijuana, which is comparatively much cheaper by weight. The number of registered smuggling incidents involving maritime vessels climbed from nearly 50 in 2011 to more than 80 in 2013, but fell to about 30 in 2016. (See GAO graphic below) The most popular maritime method studied was the panga boast, which accounted for nearly 65 percent of the 309 logged incidents, with the rest involving recreational vessels. Around 76 percent of incidents took place on the West Coast, specifically California, with the rest spread around the southeast coast, northeast coast, and the southwest border. Again, this smuggling method appears to be more popular for smuggling marijuana, which accounted for nearly 86 percent of connected seizures, compared to nearly 14 percent for cocaine and less than 1 percent for methamphetamine. Not only have all of these smuggling methods seemingly declined in popularity in recent years, they also appear to account for a tiny percentage of total smuggling. In 2015, for example, DHS recorded just 49 seizures involving these methods out of 12,900 seizures overall. There are several conclusions to draw from the GAO report and each of them undermines the logic behind US President Donald Trump's claims that building a wall along the US-Mexico border will significantly stem the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. Firstly, the report demonstrates how these techniques remain minority methods, generally favored only for moving bulky shipments of marijuana. Moreover, they appear to be in decline even in the absence of a wall. The reason for this, as the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) notes , is that by far the most common method of smuggling is still through official points of entry. Far from using underground railways or airdrops, most drugs enter the United States concealed in passenger vehicles or hidden among legitimate goods on freight vehicles, something that will not be significantly impacted by a border wall. However, while these alternative methods remain relatively uncommon, they are also a reminder of the ingenuity and innovation of drug trafficking networks. This ability to react to the challenges posed by law enforcement also undermines the logic of Trump's wall. While a physical barrier may impact another lesser-used, although still common form of smuggling -- backpackers carrying drugs across on clandestine overland trails -- traffickers are more than capable of adapting new methods to compensate. Finally, the report offers advice on how US authorities could improve their organization and operations to better tackle these types of smuggling. The suggestions vary widely, and include improving detection technology such as radars and sensors, administrative actions such as improving interagency coordination, and better techniques for gathering and analyzing information and intelligence. The report does not mention a physical barrier among the potential solutions to this problem."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Panama Mayor Linked to Transnational Drug Trafficking Organization. Authorities in Panama have linked the mayor of a seemingly sleepy seaside town to a transnational drug trafficking organization, suggesting homegrown Panamanian groups may be deepening their role in the drug trade with help from local officials. On September 24, Panamanian security forces arrested 11 people linked to a drug trafficking organization operating in the town of La Villa de Los Santos on Panama's Pacific coast as well as the Pacific province of Chiriqui near Panama's northern border with Costa Rica. According to a press release from Panama's Attorney General's Office, the group transported cocaine from Colombia north along Panama's Pacific coast. Authorities arrested the leader of the suspected trafficking ring along with several of his associates, including a number of public officials in La Villa de Los Santos. The operation saw the arrest of Mayor Eudocio Perez, who according to La Estrella is also a high-ranking official of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Democratico - PRD), as well as the mayor's assistant and two police officers, La Prensa reported. According to the Attorney General's office, security forces seized 2.1 metric tons of drugs, two machine guns, nearly $1 million in cash and 18 vehicles, four of which had false bottoms presumably used to transport drugs. (Video c/o Panama Attorney General's Office) Panama's strategic location has historically made it a key transit point for drugs and contraband exiting South America and entering Central America. And in the past, local security forces and politicians have engaged in drug trafficking activities. However, the dismantled network's alleged ties to a small-town coastal mayor suggest homegrown Panamanian trafficking groups may be increasingly counting on the complicity of local officials to help them handle the growing flow of cocaine through Central America spurred by Colombia's cocaine boom. The increasing amount of drugs has likely come with an influx of cash for Panamanian trafficking organizations. And these crime groups may be using some of that dirty money to buy off local officials who have influence in strategic trafficking areas. Panama's Pacific coast is particularly attractive to international drug smugglers due to increased pressure on Atlantic trafficking routes originating in Colombia. Traffickers have begun to shift to using Pacific maritime routes to send cocaine north, a trend that has been evidenced by huge seizures in Pacific Colombian port cities like Tumaco. The Panamerican Highway -- an important overland trafficking route -- also runs along Panama's Pacific coast, giving crime groups another reason to seek to co-opt officials in this area of the country.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Police Corruption Fuels Rise of Extortion in Peru. Extortion by criminal groups is now an accepted cost of doing business for small businesses and construction companies in Peru, according to experts. The practice is facilitated by corrupt police forces that charge money for protection and collaborate with criminal groups. Juan Chavez, president of the Peruvian Chamber of Construction (Capeco) in the town of Piura, told El Comercio that 100 percent of businesses in the region of La Libertad and Piura are extorted. Other business owners said, ""At any moment we might receive a letter with a bullet or explosives, or worse still, a visit from an armed group."" Juan Carrasco, an anti-extortion lawyer in Chiclayo, told El Comercio that extortion cases have risen by 50 percent, even though only 3 percent of businesses report being extorted. Extortionists can charge upwards of $175,000 for the ""security"" of a construction site, or $18,000 per month. In some cases, extortionists demand construction companies pay the $175 weekly salaries of fake workers. These costs can add up to almost 3 percent of the value of the company's contracts. Many cases of extortion go unreported due to police corruption and collusion with criminals. Some owners of construction companies say when they ask for police intervention they are charged $70 per day for the police to guard their construction site, or a daily $70 per agent if they want the police to ""clean the area"" of criminals. Sometimes, however, paying the police achieves little because the extortionists pay them more -- between $1,000 and $1,800 -- to stay away, according to El Comercio. As InSight Crime has recently reported , the rise of extortions is a serious concern for Peru. Construction is not the only economic sector affected, with other businesses such as transportation companies also suffering. What is perhaps most concerning about the rise of extortion in Peru is police complicity with criminals of the type highlighted by El Comercio. However, such corruption is not only present among low level police but also commanding officers; this past December a Peruvian police chief was arrested on charges he was working with the Nuevo Clan del Norte extortion gang after seven of his deputies reported being ordered to work on their behalf. While this corruption continues unchecked, extortion is likely to continue to rise in Peru."	0	1	0	0	1	0	0
"Paraguay Captures Members of Brazils PCC. Authorities in Paraguay have captured four members of a PCC cell operating on the country's eastern border with Brazil, reinforcing notions that the Brazilian organized crime group is increasing its presence in its neighboring country. Officers from the country's National Anti-drugs Secretariat (SENAD) arrested the cell's leader Jair Jose dos Santos, alias ""Nain,"" on October 31, alongside three other members, in a house in the border town of Pedro Juan Caballero (see map below), reported ABC Color. According to EFE , the four Brazilians made up an ""armed wing"" of the First Capital Command (PCC), one of Brazil's most powerful organized crime groups, and were wanted on charges of drug trafficking, criminal conspiracy, assault and homicide in their homeland. SENAD chief Luis Rojas said the men would face justice in Brazil and were due to be ""expelled,"" rather than deported, because the deportation process is too time consuming, reported Ultima Hora. ABC Color reported that guns and ""other evidence"" were found in the house where the men were captured. While a PCC presence in Paraguay is nothing new, it is their rivals, the Rio de Janiero-based prison gang Red Command, which are more often associated with Paraguay's drug trade. The Red Command, or Comando Vermelho as it is known, has been reported to ship one ton of cocaine out of Paraguay each month. Earlier this year, Paraguayan authorities dismantled an armed wing of the Red Command in another border town just 60 miles from where the PCC cell was captured. For its part, the PCC is better known for maintaining a heavy presence in Bolivia. However, with Paraguay also a major transshipment points for cocaine and the biggest producer of marijuana in South America (80 percent of which is destined for the domestic market in Brazil, according to the US State Department ), the profits on offer and the rapid expansion of the PCC will likely see it increasing its presence in Paraguay. This trend may be spurred by the high level of impunity drug traffickers enjoy in the country's key trafficking corridors. The department of Amambay, where the PCC cell was captured, is also a key trafficking area where the Paraguayan Peoples' Army (EPP) -- which has been linked to drug trafficking -- is known to have a presence and where it has been suggested Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel may be interested in establishing activities ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Could Dissent in Venezuela Military, Judiciary Crack Maduros Criminal Regime?Cracks have appeared in Venezuela's increasingly criminal regime. Dissidence has set in within the military, which is propping up the flailing government, and a key opposition leader is calling for more soldiers to defect, while the attorney general continues to challenge the president. In a video posted on his Twitter account, jailed opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, head of the Voluntud Popular (Popular Will) party, has called on the military to cease complying with orders they are receiving from the leadership of President Nicolas Maduro.* ""To the soldiers who are in the streets today, I want to send a very calm, clear message that is framed in our Constitution: You have the right and the duty to rebel,"" Lopez, who was arrested and eventually imprisoned by the Maduro administration in 2015, said in a video recorded from the Ramo Verde military prison where he is jailed. His remarks were likely prompted by the increasing evidence of dissent within the ranks of the armed forces, who have been on the front line of the government's sometimes deadly repression of opposition street protests that have now been running for nearly three months. At least 14 army officers were arrested in April during the first week of the ongoing wave of popular unrest. The charges against them included ""rebellion"" and ""treason,"" according to official documents obtained by Reuters. In addition, at least three lieutenants from the military -- Jose Alejandro Michael Sanchez, Angel David Mogollon Medina and Alfredo Jose Rodriguez -- have deserted to Colombia and denounced Maduro and his regime. On top of this, over the last year Venezuela's attorney general Luisa Ortega Diaz, a former loyalist to the regime, has increasingly gone rogue. On June 8, Ortega called for all Venezuelans to oppose Maduro's effort to rewrite the constitution. ""What is at stake here is the country, and the integrity of all Venezuelans,"" the attorney general said, according to the Associated Press. The first time Ortega voiced her disagreement with Maduro's security policy was in July 2016, when she criticized the Operation Liberation of the People (Operaciones de Liberacion del Pueblo - OLP), the controversial anti-crime drive implemented by the regime that has caused extrajudicial killings to surge. But her boldest move came on March 31, when Ortega declared that a Supreme Court ruling effectively seizing power from the National Assembly, which is controlled by the opposition, signaled a violation of the constitution. That criticism caused the Supreme Court to reverse the ruling , and the following day Maduro announced the stalemate had been resolved. However, the controversy could not be undone, and it reignited opposition protests that continue today. Since then, Ortega has repeatedly denounced the ""political"" violence that has killed nearly 70 protestors so far. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, she stated that ""we cannot expect citizens to act peacefully and in accordance with the law if the state takes decisions that are against it."" On May 27, Ortega shared the results of an investigation into the death of Juan Pernalete, one of the young protesters killed during the marches. Pernalete was hit and killed by a tear gas canister shot by the Bolivarian National Guard (Guardia Nacional Bolivariana - GNB), according to evidence seen by Ortega. This contradicted the government's official version of events, and Interior Minister Nestor Reverol and Defense Minister Padrino Lopez tried to refute and discredit the attorney general's statements. But the political controversy prompted by her latest public declarations have caused another important, but perhaps more veiled, criticism to go almost unnoticed. In 2016, for the first time, the Attorney General's Office annual report featured a chapter dedicated to organized crime. The document outlines the levels and nature of crimes such as extortion, kidnapping, drug trafficking, money laundering, financial fraud, contraband and theft, as well as the effectiveness of anticorruption measures, showing statistical evidence for each illegal activity, the steps taken by the institution to combat them and relevant examples. It takes a more objective tone on organized crime, one more in line with the international community. It recognizes the scale of the problem in the country, and objects to the government's efforts to tout almost any crime perpetrated in Venezuela as actions committed by paramilitary groups. Venezuela is now one of the most violent countries in the world, and organized crime, which was minimal when former President Hugo Chavez took power in 1999, went into accelerated growth under his ""21st Century Socialism."" So far, Ortega's denunciations have cost her the presidency of the Moral Republican Council (Consejo Moral Republicano), a public ethics body. But she is risking alot more by putting herself in the crosshairs of a regime that has proved itself willing and able to use violence to protect its interests. If Maduro is eventually able to replace Ortega with a more pro-revolution official, her criticisms and good intentions could be short-lived. However, it will not be easy to do this legally -- he would have to dissolve the National Assembly (which he has tried to do and failed) in order to remove top officials from other branches of power. But Venezuela's officials would do well to heed Ortega's strong words and turn them into more concrete actions against new forms of organized crime that have emerged during the socialist regime, many of which are backed by political elites. For instance, the country's prisons are in the hands of powerful gang leaders known as "" pranes ,"" who operate with the tacit cooperation of the government. The "" colectivos "" -- civilian armed groups aligned with the regime -- have acted as some of the fiercest repressors of the street protests, and are also active in microtrafficking, kidnapping, black market food and extortions. Ortega has done little to limit these criminal forces, the latter of which are key armed enforcers for the current regime, especially in the poor neighborhoods of the capital, Caracas. Given the government's relationship with various types of criminal networks, including some that operate in official circles, addressing these issues is no simple matter. Indeed, the focus promoted in the attorney general's annual report threatens the criminal markets in which the state has interests. It stresses the need to take organized crime more seriously and the importance of rebuilding anti-crime efforts with international partners, especially with respect to drug trafficking, corruption and contraband. (Chavez officially expelled the US Drug Enforcement Administration in 2005.) Drug trafficking, for instance, has reached the highest levels of Maduro's government. Current Vice President Tareck El Aissami became the highest-ranking member of government to be sanctioned or indicted by the United States for drug trafficking earlier this year. Contraband oil and food is a large source of income for corrupt elements in the regime, including the military , and kleptocracy has helped bring the country close to collapse. The small signs of rebellion within Venezuela's armed forces are competing with strong incentives to stay loyal to the government. Profits from criminal activities and maintaining the status quo that allows those criminal markets to exist; thus, many members of the military are unlikely to be heavily influenced by Lopez to lay down their weapons. The military has benefited hugely from the artificial exchange rates operated by the Maduro government (and introduced by Chavez), and the regime has allowed them to profit from their role in managing the country's food production and distribution in a climate of acute shortages. An investigation by the Associated Press revealed the extent to which the military is at the heart of the contraband food trafficking business. Under the current government, the military's role in the transnational cocaine trade has also grown. Soldiers on the border profit from colluding with or turning a blind eye to Colombia's rebel armies and other criminal groups running drug trafficking operations across the frontier wth Colombia. Many high-ranking members of the military as well as the government ( networks known loosely as the Cartel of the Suns ) have been targeted for their role in the drug trade by the United States. However, there is little doubt that many members of Venezuela's armed forces will be confronting their consience in the days and weeks to come -- if they haven't already -- and weighing the pros and cons of a new chapter in Venezuelan political history. In the event of a political transition, what is certain is that the military will fight to maintain its role as a key power broker in Venezuela's political scene. * Correction, June 14: This sentence has been amended to reflect the fact that Lopez is the leader of the Popular Will party. An earlier version of this article stated that he is the head of the Justice First party. While Lopez did co-found Justice First, he has since moved on to Popular Will."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Will Venezuelas Citizen Security Reform Continue Despite Re-militarization?January saw an accentuation of the progressive remilitarization of citizen security under the Maduro government, with military officers placed at the head of the National Security University (UNES) and the National Police (PNB). These changes amount to a setback to citizen security reforms that have attempted to separate the military and the police since 2008. Nevertheless, there have been a number of security announcements made in the past few weeks that suggest citizen security reform is not dead. At the end of January, the government announced an initiative called ""Intelligent Patrolling."" It divides hot spot municipalities into more manageable quadrants in order to allow police officers and the People's Guard (a branch of the National Guard) to respond more quickly and efficiently to reports of crime and emergencies. Particular police units have been assigned to these quadrants and are given corresponding telephone numbers that residents in that area can call for police attention. The plan has been implemented in six municipalities in Caracas, deploying 3,700 officers to 158 quadrants (for maps of these quadrants click here ). This article originally appeared on the Washington Office on Latin America blog Venezuela Politics and Human Rights. See original article here. The Ministry of Interior and Justice argues that the plan is innovative in its ""place-based"" approach to policing and will result in faster police response times, more accurate information on when and where crimes take place, and improved strategies to deal with that crime. Insiders suggest that while it is positive that the government has adopted the term ""patrolling"" -- long a point of contention in Venezuela's police reform -- this initiative does not reflect an understanding of it. Rather, it simply adds cell phone numbers to the traditional stationary checkpoint approach -- some have called the plan ""alcalbala inteligente"" (intelligent road blocking). Furthermore, the initiative can only work if people actually call the police. The fact that many Venezuelans think that reporting crimes is either futile or dangerous could be a major impediment. The Interior Ministry has also moved forward with the Citizen Police Oversight Committees (Comites Ciudadanos de Control Policial -- CCCPs). These groups came out of the 2008 reform and are intended to oversee police functions, operations, administration, and resources. The first set of committees, organized 2 years ago, held elections last November for new committees that will serve for the next three years. On January 31, 25 new committees were inaugurated by Interior Minister Miguel Rodriguez Torres. The extent to which these groups have been able to perform their external oversight functions is still unclear. The committees' first few years have been challenging due to limited access to information, the political upheavals of 2013, and resistance on the part of police supervisors. However, the elections, as well as Rodriguez Torres' presence at the inauguration, suggest that citizen participation in security will not be totally abandoned. Finally, the government has continued to discuss a ban on the carrying of arms by citizens. This measure was originally included in the disarmament proposal written by the Presidential Disarmament Commission. However, it was removed from the final proposal due to lobbying pressure within the National Assembly, substantially reducing the law's impact. At the end of January, both Rodriguez Torres and Maduro stated that they supported renewing the debate over a total ban on civilians carrying guns. Given that many of those originally against this ban in the National Assembly were military officers, the backing of Rodriguez Torres -- a general in the National Guard -- could be influential. *This article originally appeared on the Washington Office on Latin America blog Venezuela Politics and Human Rights.

"Has Mexico Neutralized the Knights Templar Boss?A senior security official in Mexico has claimed that the leader of the Knights Templar criminal organization is ""practically neutralized,"" but ""La Tuta's"" latest YouTube rant suggests the notorious cartel boss is not ready to bow out just yet. Speaking in an interview with Milenio TV , the head of Mexico's National Security Commission, Monte Alejandro Rubido Garcia, said the federal security forces had effectively ended the operations of the Knights Templar (Caballeros Templarios) and their leader Servando Gomez Martinez, alias ""La Tuta,"" in the troubled state of Michoacan. ""I can assure you that today 'La Tuta,' is not operating, he is not working because he doesn't have the margins to maneuver,"" he said. However, just days before Rubido's interview, La Tuta returned to his favorite Internet soapbox, YouTube, to post a video attacking the self-defense militias that have been fighting the Knights Templar in the region (see below). The drug lord alleged that several leaders owed the Knights Templar money for drugs or in cash loans. Elsewhere in the state, former Governor Fausto Vallejo has become embroiled in scandal after the publication of a video of his son discussing the region's political situation with La Tuta (see bottom). Vallejo has claimed that his son was forced to attend the meeting with La Tuta, calling him a ""victim of organized crime."" However, the Mexican authorities have launched an investigation into his ties to the Knights. There is no doubt that the Knights Templar have been left reeling by an assault waged by vigilante militias on one hand and federal forces on the other. The Knights have been driven from areas once firmly under their control and have lost most of their key leaders , leaving La Tuta an increasingly isolated figure. However, whether this means that La Tuta no longer has power to carry out operations is debatable. He has likely lost the ability to move and operate freely in Michoacan, but such territorial restrictions do not fatally cripple a criminal organization -- all that is really needed to keep the business running is for communication channels to stay open. This capacity to operate from afar has been amply demonstrated by capos such as the Sinaloa Cartel's Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, who authorities believe moved constantly throughout six states before his capture, or the Colombian narcos who have managed operations from as far away as Venezuela and Argentina. Ongoing corruption scandals in Michoacan offer another reason why it will be more difficult than Rubido claims to fully dismantle the Knights Templar. The group has deep roots in the state, having infiltrated politics, security institutions, and business communities."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"MS13 Selling Weapons, Seeking New Profits. The street gang MS13 is reportedly selling weapons in El Salvador's capital, a sign that the gang might be seeking new revenue streams. A Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) cell is selling weapons in the center of San Salvador, reported La Prensa Grafica. The clique, known as Centrales Locos Salvatruchos, has allegedly settled in the area and expanded its business despite efforts by the National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil - PNC) and the Attorney General's Office (Fiscalia General de la Republica - FGR) to fight against the gang. The MS13 reportedly began to sell weapons in the area in 2012, the news report said. Before then, the business was by and large run by independent purveyors commonly referred to as ""coyotes."" The MS13 displaced them, authorities told the newspaper, and began selling military weapons, including M-16 and AK-47 rifles, pistols and ammunition. Authorities believe some of the weapons sold by the gang are stolen within El Salvador, while others come from neighboring countries. ""We have information that says [the weapons sold by the MS13] are coming from countries across Central America, such as Nicaragua, Guatemala and Honduras and can confirm that weapons have entered El Salvador from those countries,"" David Munguia Payes, El Salvador's Defense Minister, told La Prensa Grafica. While the MS13's ties with arms trafficking have long been known , gangs are generally thought of more as buyers than sellers. The fact that the criminal group is reportedly supplying firearms in El Salvador's black market is a sign that the gang might be seeking to expand its revenue streams. It is a troubling turn. For years, weapons have been disappearing from military stockpiles , and street gangs are known to carry military-grade weapons. By sourcing weapons from neighboring countries, the MS13 seems to have adopted an arguably more sophisticated way of obtaining the supply they need for themselves and others. The recent capture of a Salvadoran drug trafficker in January 2017 helped to shed more light on the ways in which the gangs source their weapons. Carlos Arnoldo Cardoza Sandoval, alias ""Melao,"" reportedly provided weapons to the MS13 and its rivals in the Barrio 18. Authorities believe that between 2002 and 2016, Melao traveled to Honduras an estimated 125 times , where he obtained the weapons he then provided to the gangs, part of which the criminal groups sold on the black market. Melao first worked for the Barrio 18, but when rumors that the gang was plotting his assassination began to spread, he sided with the MS13 until his capture on January 15, 2017."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Colombia Seizes Just 3% of Criminal Assets. A former top prosecutor has said that Colombia seizes less than $750 million a year in illegal assets, but that a recent reform could cut in half the time it takes to confiscate illicit property, suggesting that the government is poised to make a serious dent in the finances of criminal groups. Former Colombian Vice Prosecutor General Wilson Alejandro Martinez Sanchez, author of an upcoming study on the topic, told InSight Crime that between $500 million and $750 million in illegal assets are seized each year in Colombia. This figure would represent 3 percent or less of the $18 billion annual earnings of Colombia's organized crime groups, according to an estimate given in a World Bank study. A January update to the property seizure law will give authorities greater ability to seize assets from suspected criminals who have not yet been convicted, according to Martinez. He estimates the new legislation will cut the average time needed to complete property seizures from seven years to three or four years. ""These modifications allow the property seizure law to fully realize its potential in the fight against organized crime,"" Martinez told InSight Crime. Colombia's existing property seizure law was hailed by former President Alvaro Uribe as one of the country's ""most feared"" anti-drug tools, and authorities succesfully used it in previous decades to confiscate assets from major organizations including the Medellin Cartel , the Norte del Valle Cartel , and the Cali Cartel. However, bureaucratic hurdles -- such as inefficient judicial proceedings -- have slowed property seizure cases and limited the law's power, as Martinez noted to InSight Crime. There is also the issue of corruption in the handling of seized assets. Colombia's National Narcotics Directorate -- which was formerly responsible for managing such assets -- is currently being disbanded, following a scandal in which billions of dollars seized from drug traffickers were found to have gone missing. One police colonel in Santa Cruz, Bolivia also highlighted the potential for mismanagement of seized assets when he told InSight Crime his office was looking to seize properties from traffickers in order to acquire new office space. Colombia is one of just a handful in Latin America which has property seizure laws in place. Guatemala has faced similar bureaucratic challenges as Colombia in implementing such legislation, and Mexico opened just 29 asset seizures cases between 2009 and 2012."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Tracking the Steady Rise of Beheadings in Mexico. According to Mexico's Attorney General's Office, conflict between organized criminal groups has resulted in the beheading of 1,303 people in five years, a grisly tactic becoming the hallmark of the war between the country's cartels. El Universal reported that decapitations steadily increased during President Felipe Calderon's term in office: just 32 beheadings were registered in 2007, while 2011 registered 493 such deaths between January and November. The count will likely be similarly high for 2012. Last May saw the discovery of 49 headless and dismembered bodies in Nuevo Leon state , attributed to the Zetas , who are closely associated with the tactic. According to El Universal, the border states most affected by drug violence are also the ones that see the greatest number of victims beheaded. Chihuahua state registered 171 such killings during Calderon's term, followed by Guerrero (149), Tamaulipas (119), Durango (115), and Sinaloa (89). Previously to 2006, decapitations -- especially done en masse -- was a relatively rare phenomenon in Mexico. One of the most prominent cases took place in September 2006, when the Familia Michoacana announced their existence by leaving five heads on a dance floor in Michoacan. The brutality of the tactic was meant to attract attention, terrorize the local population, and intimidate any rivals. As the data recently released by the Attorney General's Office shows, beheadings have only become more common since then. Decapitations are used to deliver threats to rival criminal groups or to government institutions (and even schools ). 2012 has seen several mass beheadings. from Guadalaja (18 killed) to Nuevo Laredo (14 killed, with the heads placed in ice chests in several locations across the city). This may be partly indicative of how crowded Mexico's criminal market has become. With the large transnational organizations splintering and new generation groups emerging as the primary drivers of violence, the only way to assert themselves is by becoming more dependent on brutality and shock tactics. The state with the second-highest number of beheadings, Guerrero, is one of the areas most affected by these warring splinter groups , the remnants of the Beltran Leyva Organization. The high number of decapitations here looks like a symptom of that conflict. The increase in beheadings -- along with the mass dumping of bodies in public places -- is a move away from the traditional practice of burying victims in mass, hidden graves. It also speaks to the need for criminal groups to appear ever more intimidating in these public displays of violence. The rise in beheadings has also accompanied an overall rise in the number of massacres in Mexico. Crime analyst and National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) professor Eduardo Guerrero told El Universal that during the first three years of Calderon's term in office, Mexico registered an average of 10.3 massacres per month, while the second half of his term registered an average of 23 massacres per month. There are other arguments for why decapitations have become more frequently seen. Secretary of Public Security Genaro Garcia Luna has said that Mexico's criminal groups copied the execution style from Al Qaeda. Garcia Luna cited an incident attributed to the Zetas in December 2005, when the criminal group displayed the heads of four policemen in resort city Acapulco, as the ""beginning"" of Mexican groups' adoption of ""terrorist"" tactics. Similarly to Al Qaeda, Mexico criminal organizations have also recorded and distributed videos of beheadings online. Security analyst Samuel Gonzalez Ruiz has argued that the tactic was popularized after the Zetas received training from Guatemalan special forces squad the Kaibiles. Archaeologist Ernesto Vargas told Time magazine that the strategy echoes methods used by the Mayans hundreds of years ago, stating, ""The Mayans cut off the heads of prisoners as a symbol of complete domination over their enemies."" Beheadings also played an important role in Aztec mythology, in which the practice was also applied to prisoners of war and was related to fertility rituals. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Honduras is a Fantastic Anti-Drugs Partner: SouthCom. US and Honduran security forces have a superb relationship, US Southern Command has said, even as Congress holds up millions in aid to due to serious human rights concerns about the military and police in the Central American nation. Honduras is ""key"" in the fight against international drug trafficking, SouthCom's director of public affairs told La Prensa , both for its location and its cooperation with US forces. ""The collaboration with the Honduran authorities has been fantastic,"" said Greg Julian. ""Honduras has a super important role () because the majority of [drug] traffic passes through Central America, and the more we work together, the better it will be."" Drug planes that use to stop in the Dominican Republic are now using the Honduran coast instead, said Julian, but with three anti-narcotics bases being constructed the United States aims to create a net to trap such planes, alongside smugglers traveling by boat. Operation Martillo, a US operation targeting Central American drug trafficking carried out in conjunction with regional authorities, has led to the seizure of more than 300,000 pounds (136 tons) of cocaine and more than 25,000 pounds (11 tons) of marijuana since it began in January 2012, said Julian -- drugs he said had an estimated value of $40 billion. The operation would continue ""indefinitely,"" he added. Greg Julian's glowing praise of Honduran security forces might raise some eyebrows given the ongoing concerns over serious human rights abuses allegedly carried out by said forces, including extra-judicial killings -- concerns heightened by the creation of a new military police unit last month. More than $10 million of US aid to Honduras is being held up because of human rights conditions attached to it, but a loophole means these conditions do not apply to funding for counternarcotics and drug-related violence. From a wider regional perspective, the fact Julian gave such an extensive interview on drug trafficking is significant, as SouthCom rarely speaks so expansively on the issue. Alongside the construction of the new naval bases, it's suggestive of a strategy to significantly ramp up counternarcotics operations in the region, though Julian told La Prensa that budget constraints were preventing the unit from doing all it would like to. The US is in a bind when it comes to Honduras, unable to see any easy way to help the country aside from putting boots on the ground to slow the flow of drugs moving north, and the turn to Southern Command may be a reflection of that desperation."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"US Threatens to Brand Colombia Not Compliant on Anti-Drug Efforts. In an annual designation of major drug trafficking and producing nations, US President Donald Trump broke with decades of precedent by calling out the anti-narcotics efforts of Colombia, potentially complicating cooperation with one of the United States' closest anti-drug allies in Latin America. Trump delivered a memorandum to the Secretary of State on September 13 that said his administration had ""seriously considered designating Colombia as a country that has failed demonstrably to adhere to its obligations under international counternarcotics agreements,"" citing the ""extraordinary growth of coca cultivation and cocaine production"" seen in Colombia in recent years. Trump decided not to ""decertify"" Colombia's counternarcotics efforts ""because the Colombian National Police and Armed Forces are close law enforcement and security partners of the United States in the Western Hemisphere, they are improving interdiction efforts, and have restarted some eradication that they had significantly curtailed beginning in 2013."" ""I will, however, keep this designation as an option, and expect Colombia to make significant progress in reducing coca cultivation and production of cocaine,"" the president wrote in the memo. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos responded to Trump's statements by saying that ""Colombia is the country that has put the most blood into the fight against drugs,"" El Espectador reported. As was the case in past years, Bolivia and Venezuela were the only countries designated as major trafficking or producing nations that were determined to have ""failed demonstrably"" to adhere to their anti-drug obligations. As usual, Latin America and the Caribbean dominated the list; 17 of the 22 countries named are located in the region. The threat to decertify Colombia comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions between the US and Colombian governments over the effects of the latter's historic 2016 peace agreement signed with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). And the statements by the US president could prove to be an obstacle to cooperation with Colombia on counternarcotics issues. ""A slap at an ally trying to deal [with] the problem. Damage to closest bilateral relationship in hemisphere. Huge mistake,"" tweeted Adam Isacson, the senior associate for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America think tank. Colombia is indeed producing more cocaine than ever before, but the notion that the government is not doing enough to combat the drug trade lacks supporting evidence. Not only has a peace agreement been achieved with the FARC -- the single most important players in the global drug trade -- but Colombia's Urabenos, the country's largest organized crime threat, have also recently offered to surrender after authorities delivered some serious blows to the organization. Trump has made similarly alienating public comments about authorities in Mexico, another crucial partner of the United States in the fight against the drug trade in Latin America. The president once tweeted that Mexico's ""weak"" efforts to help secure the US border had been of ""little help,"" and he has routinely threatened to force Mexico to pay for the construction of a wall along the border. Comments like these risk disrupting cooperation between the United States and its most important counternarcotics partners, and could make it difficult for the United States to tackle a domestic drug abuse epidemic that is fueling criminal violence throughout the region."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Releases Narco Military Officials. Four high-ranking military officials arrested during the presidency of Felipe Calderon for suspected links with drug cartels have been released, leaving just three of the officials convicted as part of a much-vaunted anti-corruption operation still in prison. On July 5, generals Roberto Dawe Gonzalez, Ricardo Escorcia Vargas, and Ruben Perez Ramirez, and Lieutenant Silvio Isidro de Jesus Hernandez Soto were released from a maximum security prison after all charges against them were dropped. In May 2012, the men were placed under preventive detention on accusations that they had aided the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) drug cartel , based partly on testimony from jailed BLO member Edgar Valdez Villareal alias ""La Barbie,"" and from protected witnesses ""Jennifer"" and ""Mateo."" One other military official -- Major Ivan Reyna Munoz -- found not guilty in the case, was kept in custody to be tried on separate extortion charges. In April, charges were also dropped against a sixth official involved in the case, General Tomas Angeles Dauahare , based on the decision that testimony against him had been fabricated. With the release of the four military men, ten of the 13 officials convicted as part of ""Operacion Limpieza"" (Operation Cleanup) have now been released, according to Proceso , further damaging the Calderon presidency's already batterered reputation. The operation had been held up by the Calderon government as proof of its progress in tackling corruption and ending impunity, with the arrests of the military men particularly significant as it showed they were even willing to take on the army and its comparatively clean reputation. The cases unravelled rapidly , undone by their reliance on the testimonies of the cartel members turned witnesses, parts of which prosecutors have been unable to verify. With the current government of Enrique Pena Nieto content to let the Operation Cleanup cases lie, the truth of the men's guilt seems unlikely to come out. Either way, the case remains a damning indictment of the weaknesses of the Mexican security and judicial systems."	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
Colombia Decriminalizes Small Quantities of Cocaine, Marijuana. Colombia's Constitutional Court has approved a government bill to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of cocaine and marijuana, reversing a 2009 law. On Friday, Colombia's Constitutional Court ruled in favor of a bill to decriminalize possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana or 1 gram of cocaine, reported Caracol Radio. Under the new law, anyone found with less than the amounts specified cannot be prosecuted, though they may be ordered to undergo treatment depending on their level of addiction. Colombia first decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs in 1994, but then-President Alvaro Uribe overturned the decision 15 years later with a constitutional amendment. In August last year, however, the Supreme Court ruled that the amendment was unconstitutional, paving the way for the current government to propose new legislation on decriminalization. The court's ruling has not been met with universal praise from Colombian politicians and lawmakers. The country's inspector general, Alejandro Ordonez, was quick to lambast the decision, deeming it detrimental to Colombia's fight against drug trafficking, particularly the domestic drug trade. Ordonez declared that he would do everything in his power to reverse the decision, reported Semana. Attorney General Eduardo Montealegre backed the ruling, however, stating that drug consumption must be treated as a public health problem and not a criminal offence. Decriminalization laws are nothing new to Latin America with a number of countries -- from the Southern Cone to Mexico -- having enacted them over the last two decades. However, the impetus to discuss decriminalization or legalization as alternatives to punitive measures of drug control has grown significantly this year, with President Juan Manuel Santos among the most vocal advocates of a new approach. Santos stated earlier this year that Colombia would be open to legalization if it were adopted worldwide. Last week the Uruguayan government made one of the boldest proposals yet in the region, announcing it was considering legalizing and regulating marijuana sales in the country. 	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Drug Flights Cross From Bolivia to Argentina Daily: Officials. Argentine authorities claim that an average of 40 drug flights departing from Bolivia cross the border every month, an estimate that may be colored by political factors but nevertheless reflects actual dynamics of the regional drug trade. Authorities assert that each flight drops 400 to 500 kilograms of drugs in Argentina, reported La Nacion. At the rate of more than one flight per day, estimates suggest up to 20 metric tons of drugs may be shipped into Argentina using this method each month. Argentine intelligence officials reportedly communicated these estimates to Bolivian Defense Minister Reymi Ferreira during a joint aerial operation between the two countries. The frequency of clandestine flights may be aggravated by the state of Argentina's air force, which lacks sufficient operational jets and qualified pilots to intercept and interdict drug flights. The country's whole Mirage jet fighter fleet has been decommissioned, and only a few FMA IA-58 Pucara and Lockheed Martin A-4AR attack aircraft are still in service, according to Infodefensa. Current President Macri has blamed the drug flights on his predecessor Cristina Kirchner's administration for cutting defense budgets and reducing the country's aerial capacities. Macri's government has announced of several major future acquisitions of various military planes from European and US suppliers since his election in 2015. The announcement that an average of more than one drug flight per day crosses the border from Bolivia into Argentina may be tinged by politics. Amid increasing concern about drug use and drug-related crime in Argentina, neighboring Bolivia provides a convenient scapegoat for Argentine officials looking to deflect some of the blame for the growing problem. Moreover, Macri's administration has promoted a militarized approach to combating organized crime and the drug trade, even going so far as to authorize the shooting down of planes suspected of carrying drugs -- a practice that critics say is akin to extrajudicial execution. Highlighting the role of drug flights from Bolivia may help his administration justify this controversial approach. Additionally, statement came on the heels of announcements concerning the 2017 military budget. At the same time, it is clear that Bolivia plays an important role in Argentina's drug trade. Although Bolivia produces far less coca and cocaine than its neighbors Colombia and Peru, it is a key transit country for the drug. And in addition to overland trafficking , crime groups operating in Bolivia have previously been implicated in aerial drug transport in the Southern Cone region. Home-grown Bolivian criminal organizations tend to be relatively small, local and family-based, and much of the drug trade in the country is controlled by Colombian groups like the Urabenos. However, there have also been recent indications that Brazil's main gangs, the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) and the First Capital Command ( Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC) may be stepping up their operations in the Andean nation. Bolivia's Vice Minister of Social Defense Felipe Caceres Garcia recently stated that ""these cartels send emissaries with money to Bolivia to amass drugs, and along the border with Brazil and the Chiquitania [region], to assemble laboratories to start to refine coca paste into cocaine hydrochloride."""	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Mexico Sends in 3,000 Feds After Casino Arson Attack. Some 1,500 army and air force troops and 1,500 Federal Police have been deployed in the state of Nuevo Leon, north Mexico, after an arson attack on a casino which killed 52 people. The police and army arrived in the beleagured state on Saturday and Sunday, and are being supported by armored vehicles and Black Force helicopters, according to the government security ministry. They join some 2,500 extra troops sent to the state in June, reports CNN. The military are reportedly patrolling working-class neighborhoods of Monterrey , and have advised residents of the city not to go out after midnight. Five people have been arrested in connection with the arson attack, which the authorities say was carried out by the Zetas drug gang in punishment for failure to make extortion payments. InSight Crime considers that the situation was likely more complicated than this, and may have been related to a struggle for control of illegal gambling houses. The men are members of the Zetas, according to the authorities, and were caught because of a fingerprint found in a vehicle abandoned after the crime. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Bolivia Makes Record Seizures of Contraband Fuel. Bolivia is on course to seize a million liters of contraband fuel by the end of the year, five times that seized last year, according to officials. Director of the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) Gary Medrano said that the authorities had confiscated nearly 800,000 liters so far this year, and that he expected the figure to reach 1 million by the end of December. This is a massive rise from the 200,000 liters seized last year, as El Diario reported. Medrano said that the record seizures were the result of the work of the armed forces in border zones, and named several crossing points on Bolivia's borders with Brazil, Peru, and Chile as the most difficult places to control (see map). View Fuel smuggling Bolivia in a larger map The official explained that illegal transporters often take fuel close to these crossing points and sell it on to others who take it over the border. The Bolivian government heavily subsidizes fuel, meaning that it is far cheaper than in neighboring countries. Fuel in Bolivia costs about $0.54 a liter, while prices in Brazil, Argentina and Peru range from double to triple that. In Brazil, fuel sells at between $1.59 and $1.85, depending on the distance from the border, according to figures from the ANH. Prices in Argentina and Peru go from about $1.15 to $1.60. These price discrepancies create a big incentive to traffic fuel over the border from Bolivia into neighboring countries, and the ANH has estimated that some 30 percent of Bolivia's subsidized fuel is sold abroad. The demand for contraband fuel is also driven by the fact that gasoline is used to produce cocaine. It would be extremely difficult politically for the government to cut these subsidies substantially. President Evo Morales tried to slash the subsidies in December 2010, citing the fact that much of the fuel was trafficked into Chile, Brazil and Peru, but he met with massive protests and was forced to backtrack. A similar problem is faced in Venezuela, where large amounts of heavily-subsidized fuel are trafficked over the border into Colombia. One Colombian official estimated earlier this year that 38 million liters were smuggled each month from Venezuela into a single border state. Both Venezuela and Bolivia are trying to halt fuel trafficking by using electronic tracking chips to monitor sales. A similar system has been put in place in Peru to monitor sales of gasoline, tracking the locations of fuel trucks in the Apurimac and Ene River Valley (VRAE), in an effort to prevent it being used for coca production.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Guatemala Military Brigade to Fight Poppy Production Near Mexico. The Guatemalan military will deploy a special brigade to its northwestern border with Mexico, dedicated to combating the poppy trade, a new stage in Guatemala's efforts to limit the production of the raw material for heroin. The newly created Mountain Special Operations Brigade will be based in Guatemala's San Marcos province, the epicenter of the country's opium poppy trade. As Mexican newspaper El Universal reports , the military unit will focus on the historic poppy growing area in San Marcos, an area made up of three municipalities which the government calls the ""Triangle."" According to estimates by the US State Department , Guatemala may have had some 1,000 hectares of poppy under cultivation in 2011. It is the second-biggest producer of the crop in the region, with Mexico in first place and Colombia in third. The newly active military unit in San Marcos follows the gradual withdrawal of police from nearly the entire province , as Guatemala seeks to boost the military's role in the fight against organized crime. The military has steadily increased its presence in Guatemala's most conflicted provinces, including the northern border region of Peten, where controversial special forces unit, known as the Kaibiles, were deployed in mid-2012. El Universal notes that alongside the establishment of the Mountain Brigade, 2013 will also see the creation of a new naval unit based in Guatemala's most important Caribbean seaport, Puerto Barrios. The naval unit is meant to confront maritime drug trafficking near Guatemala's southern border with Honduras. The deployment of a new brigade to San Marcos should therefore be seen as part of this broader effort to expand the military's presence in the areas most troubled by drug trafficking and crime. These efforts include the creation of three new military bases in crime hotspots , including San Marcos, Peten, and Puerto Barrios. The army has reportedly budgeted some $50 million for the creation of these bases."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Over 200 Gangs Active in Panama. Panama is continuing to struggle to confront its active and sizeable gang presence, prompting President Juan Carlos Varela to call for international cooperation in combating organized crime. Panama's Public Ministry has announced that at least 204 gangs are active in the country, while Nathaniel Murgas -- who heads the government office charged with prosecuting organized crime -- said some 12 gangs were dismantled during 2014, reported La Prensa. So far in 2015, three anti-gang operations have taken place, resulting in the arrest of 200 people. Nonetheless, between 2013 and 2015, not one gang member has been convicted and sent to prison, reported Panama On. Panama's Attorney General recently announced that the office of an anti-gang public prosecutor will be created this year, aimed at decongesting the courts and accelerating trial proceedings. The challenges street gangs pose in Panama is not new, and the country's Attorney General has highlighted the financial and judicial burdens of combating this issue for several years now. Panama's president also called attention to these challenges while speaking in Cartagena, Colombia during the three-day Trans-Pacific Summit, asking for increased international cooperation in combating organized crime. The issue has been exacerbated by the presence of transnational organized criminal groups -- such as Mexican cartels and the Colombia BACRIM -- which have been detected conducting operations in Panama; apparently hiring local street gangs for drug transportation services and paying them in cash, drugs, or weapons. Some Panama gangs are even allegedly running ""oficinas de cobro,"" or criminal cells involved in transnational drug trafficking operations. Since taking office , President Varela has taken some creative measures to tackle the threat of street gangs, such as offering job training and amnesty for gang members in order to lure them away from criminal activity. Panama also spent 7.4 percent of its GDP in 2013 to contain violence. Nonetheless, the growth of Panamanian gangs and their expanding involvement in the regional drug trade is an example of how street gangs can jump into transnational organized crime if the conditions are right ( in Panama's case , these conditions being geography, institutional weakness, and corruption). Given Panama's important role in transnational drug trafficking -- and the apparently growing participation of local street gangs -- President Varela's concerns and appeals to the international community to assist in combating the problem are warranted."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Costa Rica, Nicaragua Join Forces Against Organized Crime. After a border dispute which has flared up over the last few months, neighboring countries Costa Rica and Nicaragua have signed an agreement to work together in the fight against organized crime, reports EFE. In October 2010 Costa Rica accused Nicaragua of invading territory after it sent troops to the contested Calero Island, in the San Juan river, to oversee dredging work. In March, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ordered both countries to remove all security forces from the disputed territory, and work to collaborate against organized crime. The two nations have now agreed to implement a new system to coordinate intelligence and police work. They also decided that police from each country can cross the border when chasing criminals, without this being defined as a violation of sovereignty. Mauricio Boraschi, Costa Rica's national anti-drug commissioner, said that the contested area was a key route for cocaine trafficking. Representatives of the governments of Mexico and Guatemala, where the meeting was held, served as mediators in the Calero Island conflict. A Guatemalan minister called the agreement a step towards solving the territorial dispute. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Songbirds to Raptor Eggs, the Looting of Latin Americas Bird Species. The case of an infamous Irish trafficker who is facing extradition to Brazil for stealing peregrine falcon eggs has brought attention to the diverse ways in which the region's avian species are being plundered. Jeffrey Lendrum is currently completing a prison sentence of three years and one month in the United Kingdom after being arrested in June 2018, having flown in with 19 eggs from endangered birds of prey in South Africa tied to his body, including vultures, eagles, hawks and kites, reported the Telegraph. His smuggled cargo was valued at some 100,000 pounds (around $130,000). Prosecutors in Brazil, from where he skipped bail in 2016, are now requesting his extradition. He was arrested trying to board a flight from Sao Paulo to Johannesburg carrying four albino peregrine falcon eggs that he obtained illegally in Chile, which were worth an estimated $80,000 on the black market, the Guardian reported at the time. He was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in Brazil but skipped bail. While Lendrum's high-profile heists have seen a book and numerous articles written about him, he is but the tip of the iceberg of those pillaging Latin America's native species. On January 15, a Belgian citizen, Hugo Conings, was arrested at Lima airport trying to smuggle 20 live birds in cardboard boxes onto a flight bound for Madrid, according to Peru's forestry service. These included 18 tanagers, prized for their bright plumage, and two toucanets. Conings now faces up to five years in jail. Coverage about the smuggling of wild birds from South America has often focused on parrots, especially macaws, thousands of which are reportedly trafficked every year. But the region is facing a far more complex panorama of live bird and egg trafficking, with a range of species targeted for their plumage, speed or ability to carry a tune. A December 2018 report by the wildlife monitoring network Traffic and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) found that smuggling eggs instead of live birds had become an increasingly popular option in Latin America. Beginning back in 2002 on flights between Brazil and Portugal, eggs of parrots and toucans were initially the most frequently seen examples. But the trade has evolved as awareness of this crime has grown. A National Geographic report revealed that traffickers ""launder"" the eggs of macaws, flying them into Europe illegally, incubating them there and then selling them off legally as having been bred in captivity. The deception runs deep. The chicks are hatched in aviaries, fed by hand and have metal bands placed on their legs to simulate the breeding process. The only way to detect if a bird was truly bred in captivity is to carry out a ""DNA parentage test"" by plucking and then examining feathers to see if the birds truly have the parentage described in their paperwork. Parrots are not the only target. Lendrum's poaching career revolved around birds of prey, including peregrine falcons. This bird, the fastest on earth that can reach speeds of over 320 kilometers per hour, is prized by falconry enthusiasts, often in the Middle East. His 2016 arrest in Brazil came when he tried to smuggle peregrine falcon eggs originally taken from Chile. An attempt was made to repatriate the eggs before they hatched, but only one chick survived and was eventually released in Patagonia, according to a British police report. But the smuggling of eggs has not replaced attempts to steal live birds, as shown in the recent Peru case. ""The other big trade is in songbirds,"" Traffic spokesperson Richard Thomas told InSight Crime. Songbirds such as the large-billed seed finch are taken from the wild to be used in songbird competitions. ""People bet on how many songs it will sing in an hour, for example, or how long it can keep singing,"" explained Thomas. Songbird competitions are popular pastimes in Guyana and Suriname, he said, adding that the practice had spread to expatriate communities in New York and the Netherlands. These diminutive songsters can fetch between $3,000 and $5,000 each in the United States, according to a New York Times investigation. But not all the bird trafficking leaves the region. The saffron finch , for example, has been smuggled from Peru to Brazil for singing competitions. ""Smaller species like songbirds haven't received the same priority,"" said Thomas. ""They reproduce faster and their population rebounds more rapidly, but there are real risks. The red siskin, popularly kept as a caged bird, has largely been extirpated from its natural range."" And while the joint Traffic-WWE investigation found that the ""international illegal trade in South American birds has been reduced to its lowest level in decades,"" it's still a major cause for concern. It also remains to be seen if the jail terms facing the likes of high-profile eco-traffickers like Lendrum will act as an effective deterrent."	0	0	1	0	0	1	0
"Chavez Blames Paraguay Impeachment on Narco-Infiltration. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has stated that drug traffickers working with the opposition were behind the recent impeachment of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo. On July 14, Chavez declared, ""Drug traffickers infiltrated the ranks of the political right in Paraguay"" to instigate the downfall of Lugo, adding, ""It was a coup against all of us, against the dignity of the Latin American and Caribbean peoples,"" reported the Associated Press. Chavez's comments came a little over a week after the president of Uruguay, Jose Mujica, blamed Lugo's removal on "" narco-Coloradismo ,"" the influence of drug traffickers on the right-wing opposition Colorado Party (ANR-PC) who ruled Paraguay for six decades until Lugo took office in 2008. Though Lugo's successor, Federico Franco, is from the left-wing Authentic Radical Liberal Party (PLRA), the group joined with the Colorado Party to bring about the vote that led to Lugo's removal. This has led some to speculate that the Colorado Party are laying the groundwork to come out on top in presidential elections scheduled for next year. InSight Crime While Chavez is known for making outspoken comments of questionable accuracy, Paraguay is ranked as the second most corrupt country in Latin America by Transparency International's (TI) 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index -- only Venezuela was placed lower. However, how much of this corruption is down to narco-influence as opposed to other forms -- embezzlement or nepotism, for example -- is difficult to ascertain. What's more, the country scores lower on TI's index than it did when Lugo took office four years ago, suggesting traffickers may now have greater ease of operation than they did when the Colorado Party was in power. Paraguay is South America's biggest producer of marijuana, and accounts for 15 percent of global production. This has made it a vital country for the drug trade, much of it run by Brazilian groups. In May last year , Paraguayan officials admitted that Brazilian gangs such as the First Capital Command (PCC) and the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) had set up operations in the country. While there have been reports of corruption in the Paraguayan military , including claims that soldiers sold arms to Brazilian gangs and let them operate their trafficking routes freely, this is little substantive evidence to back Chavez's claim that the corrupting influence of gangs has reached the upper echelons of politics.

"Argentina Cocaine Seizure Highlights Domestic Demand. Argentine police dismantled a drug laboratory and seized 1 ton of cocaine apparently packaged for the domestic trade, underscoring the importance of Argentina's drug market. On June 11, police discovered a cocaine processing lab along with precursor chemicals and 1 ton of cocaine in a house in Escobar, Buenos Aires province. Though authorities couldn't rule out that some of drug could have been intended for sale abroad, the packaging of the cocaine into ""tizas,"" small amounts sold on the street, point to the domestic drug trade, reported Clarin. Seven Argentines and one Paraguayan national were arrested in the operation in Escobar. In a separate operation on June 11 in the northwest province of Jujuy, police detained four Bolivian nationals attempting to smuggle 85 kilograms of cocaine through the country. Unlike the Escobar seizure, however, the cocaine was packaged in bricks (pictured) weighing a little over a kilo each, suggesting it could have been export-bound. According to the United Nations 2011 World Drug Report , Argentina accounts for 25 percent of cocaine use in Latin America and the Caribbean, making it the second largest market in the region after Brazil. Cheaper cocaine derivatives such as crack cocaine are gaining an increased share of the market. Some believe this has contributed to the number of drug users in the country doubling since 2007. In an effort to combat trafficking for the domestic market, as well as smugglers using the country as a transhipment point for drugs going to Europe , Argentina has stepped up interdiction efforts over the last year. In July 2011, President Cristina Kirchner announced that a new radar system would be installed in northern Argentina to monitor drug flights into the country. While much of the cocaine entering the country is believed to come from neighboring Bolivia, the world's third largest cocaine producer, there have been reports of Mexican cartels using clandestine airstrips for drug flights into the northern part of the country. Argentina also announced in April that it would work with Brazil to produce Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones , to help monitor its borders and crack down on drug traffickers. The country's Congress is currently debating decriminalizing possession of drugs, including cocaine and heroin, for personal use. The bill is widely expected to pass, with judges being given the power to determine the levels that will qualify as personal consumption. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Report Highlights Size, Scope of Contraband Alcohol Market in LatAm. A recent study of the illicit liquor market in six countries in Latin America documents the size and scope of a lucrative regional industry for criminal groups that accounts for hundreds of millions of dollars in lost state revenue each year. Euromonitor International examined the volume and value of illegal alcohol sales in Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama and Peru, finding that in 2012 this market accounted for a total fiscal loss of $736 million in these countries, with contraband and counterfeit products the principal contributors. During 2012, illegal alcohol represented 25.5 percent of the total alcohol market in volume and 14.1 percent in value. The average retail prices of illegal booze was found to be 30.3 percent lower than that of legal products, with smuggled alcohol sold at lower prices to undercut the legal market. According to the report, these prices gaps, coupled with a lack of controls on residual ethanol supplies and weak law enforcement in the region, are key drivers of the trade. Of the six countries, Colombia was found to have the highest value illegal market in 2012, worth over $1 billion in retail sales, which resulted in a total fiscal loss of $468 million. Peru's illegal market share, meanwhile, was the highest in the region, worth over 30 percent of the total liquor market. Latin America is home to a thriving trade in illicitly conceived liquor. In Colombia particularly, weak border controls contribute to a massive influx of contraband goods into the country, while adulterated liquor is also an important source of profit for criminal gangs. The illegal alcohol trade is just one of a plethora of pirated and counterfeit goods markets in Latin America, prominent among them fuel smuggling and contraband cigarettes. At the beginning of 2014, Colombia's tax and customs police were seizing nearly $300,000 worth of contraband a day. These markets offer appealing money-laundering opportunities for criminal groups, such as the Urabenos and Rastrojos, who are believed to control some of the flow of smuggled goods into Colombia. Venezuela is a major source of contraband goods, a phenomenon facilitated by government price and currency controls, which offer great potential for profit in neighboring countries. Free trade zones like the one in Colon, Panama are also attractive sources of cheap liquor and cigarettes.	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
UNODC: The Role of Corruption in Trafficking in Persons. The UNODC report focuses on the close interrelation between corruption and human trafficking, critiquing existing international legal instruments that deal only indirectly with this problem, and providing recommendations on how to strengthen these tools. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime outlines the impetus for its report: Trafficking in persons and corruption are closely linked criminal activities, whose interrelation is frequently referred to in international fora. Yet, the correlation between the two phenomena, and the actual impact of corruption on trafficking in persons, are generally neglected in the development and implementation of anti-human trafficking policies and measures. This lack of attention may substantially undermine initiatives to combat trafficking in persons and prevent the customization of responses as needed. Only after recognizing the existence and the effects of corruption in the context of human trafficking, can the challenges posed by it be met. Most common among the corrupt practices used in trafficking persons, according to the report, are bribery and the abuse of power by border and visa officials. This chain extends farther, however, in some cases widening to include actors such as law enforcement and security officials, as well as parliamentarians and embassy staff. Though existing international conventions contain provisions to deal with corruption in trafficking in persons, they are limited by their inability to address the problem in isolation rather than in a generalized framework of corruption. The UNODC provides 15 recommendations to streamline efforts and focus on corruption in human trafficking in a systematic way. Click here to read the full report ( pdf ). 	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
"Top Honduran Drug Trafficker Sentenced in the US. The sentencing of a member of a Honduran drug trafficking family in a US court is the latest in a series of developments that have shaken up Honduras' criminal landscape in the past year. On July 10, the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida condemned Digna Azucena Valle Valle to 11 years and two months in prison; a sentence to be followed by five years of supervised probation, reported La Prensa. In December 2013, Digna Valle -- along with her brothers Miguel Arnulfo and Luis Alonso, and son Gerson Stanley Ortega Valle -- was accused of conspiring to traffic large amounts of cocaine from Colombia to the United States via Honduras. She was arrested in July 2014 at Miami International Airport. Along with her brothers and other relatives, Digna Valle formed part of the Valles family clan, which the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identified in August 2014 as one of ""the most prolific Central American narcotics trafficking organizations."" The family is also suspected of having ties with Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. Digna Valle faced anywhere between 10 years to life in prison. In an effort to receive a lesser sentence, she pled guilty to drug trafficking charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors by providing information on her connections in Honduras. The arrest of Digna Valle set off a domino effect that has shaken up Honduras' criminal underworld. In August 2014, two months after her arrest, Honduran authorities seized over 50 properties belonging to the Valle family. Three of her brothers were then captured in October , with the arrests occurring just days apart in the province of Copan -- the family's base of operations. This marked the first time a member of the family had been arrested in Honduras, and two of the brothers -- Miguel Arnulfo and Luis Alonso -- were quickly extradited to the United States. By the end of October 2014, nearly half of the 19 Honduran drug traffickers wanted in the United States had been captured. With so many of Honduras' leading drug traffickers being captured and ending up in US custody -- where they potentially collaborate with US investigators by becoming informants -- corrupt Honduran elites have become uneasy , eroding the country's once stable criminal underworld ."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mass Graves Found on Venezuela-Colombia Border. Authorities in Venezuela have discovered two clandestine graves near the border with Colombia, raising the possibility that violence between warring criminal groups may be claiming even more victims than reported. During the first week of May, Venezuelan authorities discovered two hidden graves containing a total of 12 bodies in the western state of Tachira, less than four kilometers from the Colombian border, reported El Tiempo. The first grave, which was found on May 4, contained victims whose hands were tied with barbed wire and whose bodies showed signs of torture. Tachira Governor Jose Gregorio Vielma Mora stated that the killings had been perpetrated by rival criminal groups fighting for control of the border region, reported El Nacional. An alleged paramilitary member who was recently detained told authorities about the homicides and gave them information that helped locate the bodies, according to Noticias al Dia. The detainee reportedly claimed that at least three of the victims were members of a paramilitary group, but authorities have yet to release information on their identities. Governor Vielma Mora stated that authorities believe the killings took place in December 2014 and January 2015, reported El Nacional. Although the authors and motives behind the clandestine graves have yet to be confirmed, Colombia's two main neo-paramilitary groups (also known as BACRIM from the Spanish for ""criminal bands"") -- the Rastrojos and the Urabenos -- operate in the Venezuela-Colombia border region. This territory is prized by criminal groups for its drug trafficking routes and for the opportunity to control the heavy flow of contraband goods across the border. Criminal groups are also involved in kidnapping and extortion in this area, and often flee to Venezuela to hide from Colombian authorities. The frontier region was previously a Rastrojos stronghold , but as this criminal group has declined, the Urabenos have waged a bloody battle for control of the territory. Although the Urabenos have largely taken over the criminal enterprises in the border region, fighting between these groups persists, and in November 2014 the Urabenos allegedly massacred eight members of the Rastrojos in the Venezuelan border state of Zuila. The recently discovered bodies are not the first sign that criminal groups are disposing of their victims in clandestine graves along the border. In March 2014, five individuals were forced to dig their own graves before being killed by alleged Urabenos operatives. The use of hidden graves -- as well as the large number of disappearances in the Colombian border city of Cucuta -- suggests levels of violence in this area may be even higher than reported."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"In Mexico, State Seeks to Ban Narco-Messages. The governor of Sinaloa state, west Mexico, is trying to outlaw the posting of ""narcomantas,"" public banners hung by drug gangs to threaten enemies or improve their image, in an initiative that seems both counterproductive and doomed to fail. Governor Mario Lopez Valdez has introduced a bill that would make it illegal to hang the banners or to serve as a lookout, also known as a ""halcon"", for criminal groups, as Riodoce reported. Lopez, whose state is among the most violent in Mexico and is home to many of Mexico's most notorious capos, did not say what the penalties would be for breaking his proposed law. Mantas have become an increasingly common element in Mexico's criminal landscape over the past few years, with messages appearing on a regular basis to taunt enemies, call on the government to take action against rivals, improve a group's image with the public, or a combination of the three. For instance, a manta posted in 2011 in two cities in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas and signed by the coalition of groups known as the United Cartels implored Calderon's government to work with them to eliminate the Zetas. The same year, mantas in Guasave , Sinaloa, mocked Joaquin "" El Chapo "" Guzman's inability to rip control of the city from his enemies in the Beltran Leyva Organization. It's worth noting that Lopez has himself been the target of mantas, delivered in a rather unusual form. In May a plane dropped thousands of flyers over state capital Culiacan accusing him of taking orders from El Chapo. Lopez strenuously denied this, saying ""This is a person I don't even know, I have never had any communication with him."" The rise of the manta is a consequence of changes in Mexico's criminal environment over the past few years. One is that the territorial dominance of criminal groups is typically far less stable -- making them far more violent -- than in the past. Many of the common uses of the manta -- from denouncing a new police chief to announcing a criminal group's arrival in a city -- reflect gangs' responses to changing dynamics. In a more static landscape, such public relations gambits on the part of criminals would not be necessary. The increase in mantas also demonstrates the degree to which the civilian population has emerged as a terrain for conflict between gangs. While a decade ago, organized crime was centered almost exclusively on the drug trade, today extracting revenue from the population through extortion and kidnapping is far more common. As a consequence, mantas frequently urge the civilian population to refuse to make extortion payments, in order to hurt their rivals' income stream. In contested cities, groups often use mantas to try to show themselves in a better light than their competitors, often claiming not to kidnap, extort, rob, or carry out other criminal activities that prey on civilians. Mantas are also the favored medium of communication when a group wants to distance itself from a particularly notorious crime and avoid a government crackdown. The Gulf Cartel , for instance, used a manta to deny responsibility for the murder of Juan Francisco Sicilia, son of a famous writer turned peace activist, while the Zetas hung mantas to distance themselves from 49 mutilated bodies discovered in Nuevo Leon last month. Halcones, which in Mexico literally means ""falcon"" or ""hawk,"" are often taxi drivers, and serve as the eyes and ears of their criminal bosses. Criminal groups use halcones to find out in advance about army operations or the incursion of enemy groups. Clearly, the government has an interest in tamping down on collaboration with criminal groups, though investigating and prosecuting ""halconeo"" seems a virtually impossible task for an already overstretched criminal justice system. Lopez's proposal is even more hopeless in its applicability for mantas, and is also unnecessary. Because there are so many places to hang a manta, and because doing so is a quick process, catching people in the act is virtually impossible. Even if they were able to do so, policing the Internet, where the messages would inevitably reappear, would be harder still. Moreover, there are presumably other, more serious crimes with which to charge the criminal henchmen hanging the mantas, from drug trafficking to weapons possession to murder. Feasibility aside, cracking down on mantas is also wrongheaded. While the taunts can be unseemly, and while there is some justified worry about criminal groups being able to dictate the public conversation, the authorities can also benefit from mantas being displayed. They are a valuable source of information regarding gangs' intentions and self-perception. Any success that the government has in outlawing them will only leave the authorities with less information on their adversaries. The attempt to outlaw mantas is part of a pattern from some officials of concerning themselves with the most visible iterations of the drug trade rather than the most harmful. Lopez previously announced a ban on ""narcocorridos,"" traditional songs that glorify the exploits of drug traffickers. Other Latin American leaders have also made noise about banning soap operas that focus on drug traffickers, which are particularly popular in Colombia. Likewise, the authorities often arrest the most vulnerable figures linked to organized crime, like street dealers, rather than the most dangerous, who are harder to catch. There's an easy explanation for this tendency -- it is the path of least resistance, and by inveighing against expressions of narco-culture, policy makers get to paint themselves as tough-as-nails opponents of criminal groups. A similar dynamic pushes elected officials to promise increasingly draconian penalties for all manner of crimes, without doing anything to improve their ability to arrest and convict more perpetrators. This is a mistaken approach to crime policy. Moreover, spending any effort at all in cracking down on mantas is patently unproductive. The mantas are among the least dangerous manifestations of organized crime in Mexico; the amount of energy devoted to stamping them out should be determined accordingly. "	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Nicaraguas Navy, Little-Known Partner in US Drug War. In his political rhetoric, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega makes no secret of his often hostile views towards U.S. foreign policy. The irony is that Nicaragua may be among the U.S.'s most effective Central American partners in the so-called ""war on drugs."" Last year the U.S. named Nicaragua a major drug-trafficking nation, alongside Costa Rica and Honduras. Nicaragua is a stopover point for cocaine shipments, where small-time contraband runners, known in the region as ""transportistas,"" move drugs up to Mexico. Most frequently used are maritime routes. Off the Atlantic Coast, traffickers use Corn Island as an important rendezvous and refueling stop, while go-fast boats also frequent the San Juan River and the waterways surrounding Lake Nicaragua. Nicaragua's certification as a major transhipment point for cocaine comes alongside an improved rate of drug seizures inside the country. On May 15, the police burned 861 kilos of cocaine, seized by the Nicaraguan Navy from a fishing boat in the Caribbean. This is the largest drug haul since the Navy's seizure of 1,643 kilos of cocaine in January. According to the U.S. State Department, Nicaraguan law enforcement confiscated 17.5 tons of cocaine in 2010 , nearly double that of 2009. Supporting the Nicaraguan Navy, which the U.S. has called ""one of Central America's most effective agencies in narcotics interdictions,"" is $36.1 million in U.S. military and police aid, granted to Nicaragua since 2007. Even as Nicaragua has stalled in reforming its judiciary or cracking down on money laundering, the Nicaraguan Navy has remained one of the U.S.'s most cooperative partners in the region. That partnership may gain more importance as neighboring countries like Guatemala and El Salvador face worsening security situations. The Nicaraguan Navy is not a high-tech force, described by security intelligence publication Jane's as ""outdated and ""small,"" with ""limited capabilities."" The Navy numbers some 800 personnel, and relies on three Israeli Dabur fast boats for patrols, as well as two Sin-Hung boats. But much of the flotilla has little ability to properly patrol Nicaragua's waters: at least 54 of the Navy's boats were once drug vessels captured by the government, as well as another 12 patrol launches built in Nicaragua *to replace wooden craft previously used in the 1990s. The U.S. has done its part to bulk up the Nicaraguan Navy, donating over $400,000 worth of equipment -- including 12 patrol boats and three electrical generators -- in early 2009. But perhaps more important than technical support has been the Navy's willingness to cooperate frequently with U.S. agencies like the Coast Guard and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), a relationship that the State Department has described as ""excellent."" Joint operations have included the most recent seizure of 861 kilos of cocaine , as well as the seizure of 2.5 tons of cocaine off the Pacific port city Corinto in May 2010. Cooperation between the Nicaraguan Navy and U.S. anti-drug agencies has gained importance as Nicaragua's other attempted reforms have stumbled. As noted by the State Department, Nicaragua is the only country in Central America that has not approved the creation of a U.S.-supported Financial Intelligence Unit, meant to monitor money laundering activity. In March 2010, the government's decision to disband a U.S.-trained anti-corruption police unit was also met with disapproval in the U.S. The action also provoked criticism that the elite unit was disbanded not because of the official ""lack of funds,"" but because, while working closely with the DEA, they were close to implicating high-ranking officials in the drug trade. In some ways, the Nicaraguan Navy are an apparent "" bright spot "" for the U.S. in a region where other key partners -- Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador -- are seeing little success in the security front. And with Nicaragua set to receive $5.6 million in military and police aid under the U.S. 2012 fiscal budget , Ortega's government may be reluctant to risk another controversial move that could threaten the ""excellent"" relationship.

Report Highlights Rampant Impunity in Mexico Forced Disappearances. Only one percent of forced disappearances in Mexico have been investigated by authorities, a miniscule figure that underscores the widespread impunity and lack of political will that have left thousands of cases unresolved. According to government figures, 29,707 cases of forced disappearances were reported between January 2006 and July 2014, according to a new series by Animal Politico. Of these individuals, 17,175 have been found and over 12,500 are still missing. In total, Mexican authorities have only initiated preliminary investigations in 291 of these cases, and have failed to sentence a single person for participating in a forced disappearance since 2006. In an interview with Animal Politico , Ariel Dulitzky -- the former head of the United Nations body that deals with disappearances in Mexico (WGEID) -- stated that systematic impunity was a major factor contributing to the high prevalence of forced disappearances. Dulitzky also identified a lack of investigation, a lack of transparency or clarity in the government's database, and inadequate search protocols as factors that have exacerbated the problem. The high number of forced disappearances in Mexico is often linked to organized crime, and in some cases the disappeared themselves may have criminal connections. According to 2013 statistics from the Interior Ministry's human rights ombudsman, of the 26,121 people registered as disappeared under former President Felipe Calderon, 20,915 had themselves faced preliminary investigations. However, simply saying the victims were themselves guilty is a government tactic that not only indiscriminately criminalizes victims and excuses state inaction, it also covers up something far more troublesome -- the involvement of the state in many cases. In a Human Rights Watch report released around the same time as the Interior Ministry's figures, the organization documented 20 cases of forced disappearances perpetrated by Mexico's navy. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) later reported that accusations had been filed against Mexican officials for 20 forced disappearances in the first five months of 2013. In addition, the involvement or complicity of the state was highlighted in the investigations of the WGEID in 2011, and in several cases cited in Animal Politico's investigation. Whoever the perpetrators behind forced disappearances are, the fact that so few are even investigated -- never mind prosecuted -- means the crime will likely remain a fixture of Mexico's security problems for a long time to come.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Caracas Police Murdered for Guns: Report. Some 26 Caracas police officers have been murdered so far this year, and analysts warn that they may be being targeted by criminals who want to steal their weapons. The assassination of Reinaldo Jose Mata Malave outside his home earlier this week brought the number of police officers murdered in greater Caracas in 2012 to 26. According to El Nacional , Mata was killed for his police-issued weapon, a Beretta pistol. Criminologist Javier Gorrino told El Universal that this type of crime is becoming increasingly common because criminals no longer fear the police, stating, ""The police have become a target for their guns."" Gorrino added that another factor driving the increased rate of police homicides -- of which there were 83 in greater Caracas last year -- is that criminals seek to elevate their status by taking out officers. The tally of 26 Caracas police officers killed in the first two-and-a-half months of 2012 puts the figure on pace to surpass last year's total by around 50 percent. Some NGOs have reported that 2011 was Venezuela's most violent year ever , with Caracas' murder rate of 108 per 100,000 inhabitants making it the most dangerous city in South America. Much of this violence can be attributed to the wide availability of guns -- 90 percent of murders in the capital last year were committed with a firearm. The government of Hugo Chavez has made efforts to curb the prevalence of guns. It created a commission in June 2011 with the aim of tightening gun regulation in the country , imposing a 180-day freeze on their sale and import. More than 117,000 firearms were destroyed by the authorities in the first 11 months of 2011, nearly doubling the previous year's total of 65,000. This crackdown may have hit supply, helping explain why police officers are being targeted for their guns. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Deadly Clashes in Rio Slum Complex Signal Pacification Flaws. One of Rio de Janeiro's largest UPP-occupied slum complexes has seen a steadily deteriorating security situation in recent months, with conflicts leaving over 20 police wounded or dead, raising further questions about a pacification program that has been criticized as short-sighted. Complexo do Alemao, home to 13 favelas sitting on the northern outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, has been the site of numerous recent clashes between security forces and alleged criminals. On July 27, two minors were hospitalized after gun fights with Police Pacification Unit (UPP) members and military police (BOPE), and two residents of the complex were killed the same weekend by stray bullets. Two more minors were killed and another wounded approximately a month earlier , and police claimed the victims were involved in drug trafficking. So far this year, 23 police have been injured and five killed as a result of such confrontations, reported Correio do Brasil. The worrisome security situation led authorities to send 500 police into the complex on July 15 to conduct a sweep of the area, and another 300 UPP members as reinforcements on July 22. A cable car responsible for transporting some 12,000 people from Complexo do Alemao each day was also recently suspended because of the ongoing shootouts, reported the UOL. Meanwhile, in another major slum complex -- Complexo da Mare -- officials announced on July 29 that armed forces that entered in April to secure the area prior to the installation of a UPP would remain there for for an ""indefinite"" period, reported O Globo. Complexo do Alemao was first occupied in a massive military operation in late 2010, and a UPP post was installed in 2012. Since then, the complex -- a former stronghold of Rio's biggest drug gang, the Red Command -- has continued to see outbreaks of violence. Following attacks earlier this year, military police reoccupied the complex. For some time, there have been signs of growing cracks in the UPP program intended to retake Rio's favelas, with continued violence in a number of key areas -- such as the city's biggest favela, Rocinha -- indicating drug gangs have not been permanently pushed out. The surge of violence in Complexo do Alemao is another indication the program is falling short. The authorities' failure to exert control in Complexo do Alemao comes amid growing criticism of the UPP program. One of the most serious complaints is that the initiative has been incomplete, with security surges not accompanied by social programs aimed at creating a lasting change in the conditions that help feed violence."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Cuban Authorities Seized Over 9 Tons Of Drugs in 2011. Cuba seized more than 9 tons of drugs in 2011, marking a 300 percent increase compared to 2010. According the state-run newspaper Granma, 9,181 kilograms of drugs were seized with roughly 9,000 kilograms being marijuana. Only just over 80 kilograms was cocaine. Despite the sharp rise, Cuban authorities were able to stop two naval operations in which three Bahamians and one Jamaican was arrested, and prevented 22 operations running through the country's airports which saw the arrest of another 27 people, the majority of whom were Cuban. They also detected 399 aerial drops to go-fast boats bound for the US, up from 108 in 2010. Authorities blamed the increase in the amounts detained on high demand in the US, which it labeled ""the world's leading consumer of narcotics."" However, Cuba intimated that it is open to the signing of an anti-narcotics treaty with the US in order to help crack down on operations running through its waters. Unlike many of its Central American neighbors, Cuba does not have any notable presence of transnational drug trafficking organizations within its territory. As evidenced by the lack of cocaine in the figures, South and Central American drug cartels may not see Cuba as a key transit point to the US. Conversely, Jamaican smugglers frequently traffic marijuana through Cuban waters, much to the exasperation of Cuban authorities. Cuba's display of interest in an anti-narcotics treaty with the US should perhaps be taken with a pinch of salt. Given the historically frosty relationship between the two countries and their inability to fully emerge from the Cold War mentality, it seems unlikely that any proposal will gain traction until relations as a whole improve. This means it is likely that smuggling through Cuba's maritime area will likely continue at a relatively steady rate thanks to the ill-equipped nature of Cuba's authorities. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Costa Rica Exporting Cocaine to 4 Continents. Criminal groups are reportedly using Costa Rica to export cocaine shipments to dozens of destinations across the globe, raising new questions about the country's vulnerability to organized crime. According to an internal report by Costa Rica's narcotics police, viewed by Mexican newspaper El Universal , in the past several years shipments of Colombian cocaine have been exported from Costa Rica to 39 different destinations on four continents. The countries receiving drug shipments from Costa Rica included China, Iran, South Africa, Latvia, and many islands of Oceania. The report is the latest indication of Costa Rica's rising position as a distribution point for international drug shipments. Authorities have noted that increased amounts of cocaine are being found inside the country, with 15.5 tons of the drug seized in 2012, up from 9.2 tons the previous year. Costa Rica's anti-narcotics police have said they dismantled over 100 drug trafficking organizations in 2012, but most of these were local distribution networks: only 12 were international drug smuggling rings. The Sinaloa Cartel , La Familia Michoacana , and the Gulf Cartel are all believed to have representatives in Costa Rica, although there have been reports that the Zetas also have a presence. Previously, Costa Rica served as a meeting point for Colombian and Mexican cartels to seal deals on the transport of cocaine to the principal market of North America. Now, however, evidence suggests that Costa Rica has moved beyond serving as a ""midway point"" for drug trafficking organizations moving product north, and is now functioning as a strategic center and base of operations for criminal groups. Mexican transnational criminal groups, with the Sinaloa Cartel at the head of the pack, have established relationships with local partners to expand their drug smuggling and money laundering operations within the country. [ Read InSight Crime's special report by security analyst Michael Porth on organized crime in Costa Rica, including Parts I , II , and III. ] President Laura Chinchilla, who took office in May 2010, has been vocal about the threat posed to Costa Rica by drug trafficking. However, her administration - currently struggling with low approval ratings - has yet to make any significant headway against organized crime. In addition to the increase in cocaine seizures, one particularly alarming development is the vulnerability of state institutions to criminal infiltration. Costa Rica, Latin America's oldest democracy, had previously enjoyed a reputation for robust democratic institutions, but the past year saw several cases of drug-related corruption among police and judicial officials."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"El Loco Barrera Extradition Opens Door for More Fragmentation. Notorious Colombian drug trafficker Daniel ""El Loco"" Barrera has been extradited to the United States, marking the end of the era of Colombian capos and cartels as the country's underworld continues to fragment. Barrera was flown to New York , where he will be arraigned on drug trafficking charges first in a Manhattan federal court, then in a Brooklyn federal court. He also faces additional charges in Florida. He was arrested in Venezuela in September 2012, bringing an end to a multi-decade career in drug trafficking, which saw Barrera become one of the most influential figures in Colombian organized crime. After his capture, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos called Barrera the ""last of the capos,"" and his extradition provides a fitting end to a period dominated by infamous drug-trafficking kingpins and monolithic cartels. In its place, a new era of more decentralized criminal networks has sprung up, with no one figure or organization able to lay claim to the power and influence garnered by their predecessors. Barrera was renowned for his negotiating skills and for establishing a broad network of drug trade contacts, which spanned the spectrum of Colombian organized crime. Barrera built alliances with numerous organizations, including the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), from which he bought cocaine, and the now fragmented narco-paramilitary group the Popular Revolutionary Anti-Terrorist Army of Colombia (ERPAC). After his arrest, Semana obtained recordings of Barrera in which he announced his intention to collaborate fully with law enforcement. If he carries through on this plan, then further details are likely to emerge about his allies' operations, as well as his transportation networks in Venezuela, Central America and Mexico, and connections with corrupt authorities throughout the hemisphere. Barrera's departure also raises questions over who will fill the vacuum he leaves behind. There are already indications of rising violence in the Eastern Plains region, which was once dominated by Barrera and his allies in ERPAC."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Guatemala to Extradite Portillo, but Real Problem Remains. The Guatemala government's decision to extradite ex-President Alfonso Portillo to the U.S. is a noble one. But even if Portillo goes, a bigger problem remains: the inept and corrupt Guatemalan court system that found him innocent despite damning evidence. Outgoing President Alvaro Colom announced last week he would honor an indictment from the Southern District of New York charging Portillo with money laundering, fraud and embezzlement of public funds totalling $70 million, much of which was channeled through U.S. and European banks. The extradition process is expected to take months. The U.S. indictment (download indictment in pdf here ) says these schemes included running money through fictitious foundations such as one called ""Bibliotecas para la Paz"" (Libraries for Peace). The body received $1.5 in checks from the Taiwanese government, which Portillo himself endorsed and later deposited into a Miami bank. These checks, and numerous others, made their way into the European banking system into accounts under the name of Portillo's daughter and then-wife, the indictment adds. The indictment also says that Portillo stole millions directly from Guatemala's Defense Ministry. And it says that he and several co-conspirators used government reserves to finance spending sprees that included expensive watches and cars for himself and his associates. And while he never admitted guilt, Portillo has certainly acted guilty since the accusations emerged. He fled to Mexico just before charges were filed against him in Guatemala. Mexico later extradited him to Guatemala, but he was released while evidence was collected. With the help of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) -- a United Nations' judicial body working with the Guatemalan government -- the Attorney General's office took Portillo into custody again in January 2010, as he attempted to board a boat and flee the country for a second time. The evidence appeared to be indisputable. Portillo's and his minions' signatures were on the checks. The money was diverted through accounts in his family's name. In all, the Guatemala case involved $15 million in misappropriated funds. But in May, a three-judge panel disallowed some of the evidence and argued that some witnesses' testimonies were unreliable, before acquitting the former president. (See video of the lead judge reading the decision below.) The ruling stunned the government and the CICIG. The CICIG's president, Costa Rican prosecutor Francisco Dall'Anese -- who successfully prosecuted two ex-presidents in his own country for corruption -- said the evidence was stronger against Portillo than in those cases. ""He didn't even hide his name,"" Dall'Anese said during a public event in the Peten state. ""Everything is documented Yet they absolved him without question."" During the same conference, Guatemala's Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz also spoke out. ""The sentence absolving Portillo is a terrible message of injustice,"" she said. ""It's a wake up call about the power structures."" The decision by Colom opens the door to a new trial in the United States, but the real problem remains in Guatemala, with the courts. The high and low courts are littered with corrupt magistrates, some of whom were placed in their positions through an anarchic system of patronage and deep-seated corruption. Criminal groups have penetrated the judicial selection committee for the high courts, which is made up of the bar association, law school deans, and university rectors. In 2009, for instance, during the selection for appellate judges, the CICIG identified eight candidates it deemed ""unfit"" for the high courts. Three were elected by Congress anyway. The courts' actions, or rather inactions, are often at the heart of impunity in a country that sees only around four percent of its murders solved. The incoming government of Otto Perez Molina may have a difficult time purging the system. Following the Portillo decision, the courts faced heavy criticism, and analysts told InSight Crime that the judges were starting to close ranks. ""If we can't reform the courts, we need to start talking about a failed state,"" said one analyst, who works with the government on this issue and spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing that work. It's not clear where Perez's own allegiances lie in this fight either. Perez is a former general, and the ""power structures"" that Paz y Paz was referring to include ex-military officials, some of whom worked closely with Portillo to pillage the Defense Ministry's pension system. Perez has publicly distanced himself from the alleged ring-leader of the Portillo debacle, retired General Francisco Ortega Maldonado. But Ortega Maldonado and other so-called Illegal Clandestine Security Apparatuses ( CIACS ) are still prevalent in the country, ready to take advantage of the weak state and its fractured judicial system.

"Cali, Colombia to Expand Gang Reintegration Program in 2017. Local officials in Cali, Colombia are planning to expand a recently instituted gang reintegration program, raising questions about what type of long-term impact such an initiative could have on the city's security situation. In early January, the Cali city government announced that the program is expected to take on a larger scope in 2017. The announcement indicates the government's openness to alternative strategies in solving a gang problem that has made Cali one of Colombia's most violent cities. The program, dubbed Integral Gang Rehabilitation (Tratamiento Integral de Pandillas - TIP), began late last year with the participation of more than 30 of the 88 recognized local gangs. The government's 2017 projections estimate the addition of 20 more gangs, with the ultimate goal of enrolling more than 1,300 gang members in TIP. The program is designed to offer the city's ""high-risk"" youth an alternative to gang life. Participants are offered vocational training, volunteer work opportunities and general reintegration guidance. In one neighborhood, according to a recent report by El Pais, gang members are working together on a farm that sits on the border of rival gang territories. Although Cali's government and law enforcement institutions have praised TIP and advocated for expanding the program, statistics measuring its impact have been inconclusive. Cali recorded a 54 percent decline in gang-related youth homicides in 2016, but the city also witnessed a 39 percent increase in revenge killings last year, according to a separate report from El Pais. The overall homicide tally dropped six percent. The TIP program is in its very early stages, making it difficult to judge the relationship between the introduction of the gang rehabilitation initiative and trends in violence in Cali. Nevertheless, there are other examples of similar programs in neighboring countries that could provide insight into the potential impact of Cali's TIP. For example, Panama saw a decrease in homicides after launching a gang amnesty and rehabilitation program in 2014. According to a report by the BBC, the homicide rate dropped 21 percent from 2014 to 2015. However, as InSight Crime has previously noted , it is difficult to distinguish the impact of the rehabilitation program from the effect of the Panamanian government's increased spending on other violence prevention programs during that time period. Further north, the government of El Salvador has also proposed establishing reintegration programs as part of its efforts to deal with serious ongoing security problems related to gangs. However, resource constraints and complex dynamics of violence in that country make it unlikely that such programs would yield sustainable results."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Top Guatemala Prison Official Filmed Negotiating with Gangs: Report. A recently published video appears to show the head of Guatemala's penitentiary system negotiating with gang leaders in a maximum-security prison, a stark reminder of how much authority the state has ceded to criminals behind bars. Guatevision published a video on May 4 that was allegedly recorded during a November 2016 security check at the Fraijanes maximum-security prison. In the video, several masked men can be seen speaking with alleged leaders of the Barrio 18 gang, whose faces are uncovered. According to the news outlet, one of the masked men is Nicolas Garcia, the director of Guatemala's penitentiary system. SEE ALSO : Guatemala News and Profiles In the recording, the man identified as Garcia can be heard reprimanding his interlocutors for the escape of four other gang leaders from the prison. ""You have had your space, but you haven't known how to use it,"" the masked figure says in reference to the incident. In a remarkable display of the control the gang maintains behind prison walls, one portion of the video shows two of the alleged gang leaders opening locks on prison gates to allow security elements to enter and conduct their search. ""Look, I need you to open all the spaces,"" an officer tells two alleged gang leaders. ""Yeah, yeah, yeah. No problem,"" one replies. SEE ALSO : Barrio 18 News and Profile Citing an anonymous source close to the case, Guatevision reported that there were no alterations or apparent breaches of the security perimeter that could explain the flight of the four gang members, suggesting that prison guards simply allowed the inmates to walk out the door. At one point, the gang leaders can be heard threatening Garcia, warning that innocent people would die in the event that authorities carried out transfers of prisoners from the Fraijanes prison. As shown in a separate video from Guatevision, this threat was explicitly reiterated by one of the leaders, Rudy Francisco Alfaro, alias ""El Smurf,"" during the February 2017 transfer of him and other gang members to the Escuintla maximum-security facility. The prison, nicknamed ""El Infiernito"" (Little Hell), is reportedly considered by inmates as one of the prisons with the worst incarceration conditions. Two months after the transfer, on April 22, the temporary director of the Escuintla prison, Jose Perez, was shot dead by several armed men in broad daylight in the middle of a public park. According to Guatevision, Perez was murdered for having refused to let inmates have electrical appliances, despite approval from Garcia. (Video courtesy of Guatevision) If the masked individual conversing with the gang leaders is indeed the director of Guatemala's penitentiary system as reported, this incident clearly demonstrates the government's failure to assert control over the Fraijanes prison and the incarcerated Barrio 18 members. Similarly, the episode where gang leaders can be seen voluntarily unlocking the gates to allow the security check offers perhaps the clearest illustration of the authorities' lack of control over what goes on behind bars. Guatemala's prison system, however, is not unique in Latin America. Many countries' penetentiaries suffer from overcrowding and control by criminal groups. Coincidently, the recording from Guatemala is reminiscent of a recent video that came out of Venezuela earlier this week, in which the South American country's prisons minister admitted to having been called directly by inmates in the middle of the night. In a striking confession during the television interview, Minister Iris Varela explained that the prisoners had called to complain about a violent riot, and that she eventually told them to take matters into their own hands."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"18 Criminals Die for Each Soldier: Mexico. Mexico's Defense Department said that for every soldier who died in clashes with organized criminal groups in the last five years, 18 alleged criminals were killed. The Defense Department (Sedena) released figures showing that 2,268 ""aggressors"" had been killed in confrontations with the armed forces since President Felipe Calderon came to power in 2006, reports Proceso. The authorities define ""confrontations"" as clashes between the authorities and suspected criminals, or between criminals, while ""aggressions"" are when the armed forces are attacked, but do not respond. There have been 1,948 of these ""confrontations and aggressions,"" involving the army in the last five years, according to Sedena, killing 126 soldiers. InSight Crime has reported on the dramatic rise in deaths in the confrontations and aggressions over the past few years, which has raised concerns that this could be due to a rise in extrajudicial killings by the army. As one former Mexican intelligence official told InSight Crime, many in the security forces are frustrated by the skyrocketing death toll and inept Mexican justice system, leading some to take the expedient option. In total, including those confrontations which did not involve the army -- either between criminal groups, or criminals and other branches of the security forces -- there were 2,099 deaths in clashes last year, according to the government.

"El Salvador Gang Truce Shaken by Peace Zone Murders. Four gang members have been assassinated in El Salvador's first ""peace zone,"" areas where all gang activity is supposed to have ceased under the terms of a nationwide truce, leading to claims that outside interests could be trying to derail the process. The murders occurred on Friday, when four members of the Barrio 18 gang were shot in the municipality of Ilopango, which in January became the country's inaugural non-violence zone. The zones are part of the second phase of a negotiated truce between Barrio 18 and rivals Mara Salvatrucha (MS13), which began in March 2012. The four gang members were killed as gang leaders from these two maras met nearby, reported El Faro. Initial reports suggested the killings were the result of fighting between the two gangs. However, the gangs said neither group carried out the murders, and suggested outsiders are trying to sabotage the peace process, El Faro reported. Witnesses said the killers abandoned their car and entered another waiting vehicle, pointing to a professionally-planned job. Ilopango mayor Salvador Ruano echoed the gangs' claim, suggesting that the killings were carried out by a death squad intent on wrecking the truce, possibly linked to the security forces. El Salvador's police rejected these claims. This is not the first time killings have cast a shadow over the peace zones or the truce. A spate of homicides occurred in Ilopango barely a month into the initiative. However, the gangs have maintained their commitment to the agreement, which nearly halved countrywide homicides after being introduced last year. While those initial gains have since come under scrutiny following a rise in extortions in the truce's first year and then a rise in year-on-year homicides in May and June 2013, President Mauricio Funes has affirmed his support for the process on numerous occasions and has called for the international community to embrace the process. Still, it is not clear if his administration is behind him, and, in a confusing display of mixed signals, Funes has also insisted the government is not actually participating in the truce. Even worse, Security Minister Ricardo Perdomo has criticized the truce, saying the gangs have used it to strengthen their ties to international drug trafficking organizations. What's more, the truce is entering the cruelest phase: election season. The truce promises to be a major point of contention in next year's presidential elections , and candidates may seek to score easy points by bashing the unpopular gang agreement. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"InSight Crime Podcast | The Presidents Judge. If you ever met the Colombian judge Ivan Velasquez, you would not think he is the giant-slayer that he is. The person who is the head of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG) is soft-spoken and deep thinker. He takes long pauses before he speaks and you are often left to divine what is going on inside his head, but he does not say much even when he does talk. Yet, the judge has taken on five presidents in his time as a judge, a prosecutor and now as the commissioner of the controversial CICIG, which has been part of the prosecution of four current and ex-presidents of Guatemala. What was it that made Velasquez such a president-slayer? We should start with the fact that he is from Medellin, Colombia, the epicenter of so many battles in Colombia's half-century of wars. First, it was the guerrilla war. Then it was the war against Pablo Escobar. And finally, it was the war involving the right-wing paramilitaries. In the early 1990s, Velasquez was the ombudsman of the department of Antioquia, where he had to investigate government actors who had employed a dirty war against Pablo Escobar. Later in the same decade, he headed up a team of prosecutors who were investigating and prosecuting paramilitary organizations. The battles prepared him for his time on Colombia's Supreme Court, where he led the investigative wing with the power to prosecute congressmen. Velasquez and his team started what became known as the ""parapolitics"" investigation, in which they jailed and sentenced numerous congressmen for their ties to the paramilitary groups. Some of the congressmen were allies of then-President Alvaro Uribe. One of the congressmen was Uribe's cousin. In what would become a pattern, the president and his allies tried to smear the judge. But Velasquez survived, even outlasting Uribe. In 2013, he became commissioner of the CICIG. The commission had already been in Guatemala for six years and most thought he would simply set up a nice exit ramp. Instead, he created an ambitious agenda that has led to the prosecution of two current and two ex Guatemalan presidents, and that is when the real fun began.

Precursor Chemical Trade Becoming More Innovative: Report. Latin American criminal organizations are relying on increasingly innovative ways to get the chemicals needed for drug production as a result of successful crack downs on the precursor chemical trade, according to a new US State Department report. According to this year's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, criminal groups are quickly developing new drug production methods using easily obtainable chemicals as a replacement for substances that face greater controls, as well as seeking out new sources. The report states that law enforcement in the region has had significant success in monitoring the international trafficking of chemicals such as potassium permanganate -- the key precursor in turning cocaine base into powder. However, as a result, many traffickers purchase precursors from chemical traffickers who divert them from the legal domestic market, often replacing them with similar but unrestricted substances, the report notes. Tightened restrictions have also prompted criminal groups to seek out replacements for other substances for manufacturing cocaine. Since 2011, traffickers in Bolivia have been replacing controlled substances such as sulfuric acid, kerosene, gasoline, diesel oil, and limestone with unregulated alternatives such as isopropyl alcohol, liquid ethyl acetate, sodium bisulphate, and cement. Controls on precursor chemicals have also affected production of synthetic drugs like methamphetamine. The report highlights how tightened control over methamphetamine precursors at first saw an increase in related seizures and arrests, but this dropped off in 2012. Authorities believe this is because traffickers are now using non-restricted precursor chemicals and alternative production methods. New controls have had an especially significant impact in Mexico, which banned the use and trade of pseudoephedrine, a precursor chemical for methamphetamine, in 2008. Since then, criminal groups have increasingly been using an alternative manufacturing process called the Phenyl-2-propanone (P2P) method, which does not require pseudoephedrine. Initially, the final product resulted in a much less potent form of methamphetamine, but manufacturers have been steadily improving their new production process since making the switch. The report identifies Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and the United States as the main exporters of precursor chemicals in the Americas, although it highlights how this is influenced by economic and geographical factors rather than a failure of law enforcement. The findings in the State Department's report highlight the difficulties in restricting a trade that is at once legal and illegal. It details numerous successes in limiting the trafficking of precursor chemicals in what were once the principal markets. However, these successes appear to have had little impact on criminal organizations, whose capacity to innovate and seek out new sources keeps them a step ahead. This is unlikely to change, despite increased law enforcement efforts, as synthetic drug production methods become increasingly varied.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Peru & Bolivia Seek to Deepen Anti-Narcotics Cooperation. Peru and Bolivia have met to reinforce cooperation on anti-drug efforts along their shared border, and to combat the growing air traffic moving coca base and cocaine from Peru into Bolivia, an air bridge which, due to a lack of technology, the authorities seem unable to cut. The two countries recently staged the First Regular Meeting of the Binational Border Commission in Lima, which closed on November 28, and during which officials from both countries discussed their joint security challenges and possibilities for cooperation, reported La Razon. The event came on the back of a recent agreement for special counternarcotics units from each country to coordinate operations in the border area. Bolivia's Vice-Minister of Social Defense Felipe Caceres last week declared the frontier zone was home to 70 clandestine landing strips for drug planes, a day after a light aircraft piloted by a Bolivian, and carrying 270 kilos of cocaine, was intercepted by authorities in central Peru. The efforts by Peruvian and Bolivian authorities to join forces in the fight against drug trafficking come several months after the two countries pledged to improve counternarcotics cooperation alongside Brazil. Earlier this year, Bolivia announced plans to work with Brazil on border security, in a move which seemed to demonstrate Bolivia's increasing acceptance of the threat posed by drug traffickers. The move by Bolivia to forge closer regional ties is also likely part of an overall effort to counteract the loss of US aid, following the expulsion of US counternarcotics forces by the government of Evo Morales. While Peru has seen US aid increase significantly , Bolivia is now relying more heavily on the EU , as well as Venezuela, for much needed funding. One of the biggest challenges facing both Peruvian and Bolivian authorities is the lack of radar to detect the drug flights moving up to 20 tons per month out of Peru's drug producing heartland -- a series of river valleys known as the VRAEM -- many of which are destined for Bolivia. While the exact details of the cooperation agreement have not been announced, it is likely to include intelligence sharing in order to more effectively identify drug flight networks and their operatives.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Over 250 Corrupt Police Transferred from El Salvador Border. Over 250 police suspected of ties to drug trafficking will be transferred out of their posts in western El Salvador in a move authorities say is a preventative measure, but seems more likely to be linked to the influence of the Texis Cartel. The agents will be forced to leave their positions in the department of Santa Ana and reassigned to new placements around the country, reported La Prensa Grafica. National Civil Police Subdirector Mauricio Ramirez Landaverde said there was no evidence the agents being transferred were corrupt and the measure is being taken as a standard precaution to prevent criminal infiltration. However, the following day President Mauricio Funes confirmed the men were transferred because of suspicions over corruption and ties to drug trafficking. While the local police chief continues to insist the transfers were part of an ongoing strategy of rotation, this seems unlikely to be the case as there have been no other transfers so far this year and police say no more are planned. It seems far more likely the authorities have strong suspicions as to which officers are working with criminal elements but do not have enough evidence to fire or prosecute them, a position hinted at by President Funes when he said, ""We are carrying out a purge with all the tools and weapons the law gives us, which is why in this case we are acting administratively by making the necessary transfers."" The department of Santa Ana is the territory of the Texis Cartel, a major cocaine trafficking organization in the region. Among the cartel leaders are renowned businessmen and politicians and it is almost certain they will have sought to co-opt security forces. There have been previous incidences of police in Santa Ana working with drug traffickers, while corruption in the PNC throughout the country is rife, and goes up to the highest levels."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Argentina Targets Barras Bravas Soccer Gangs. Authorities in Argentina have created a registry that reserves them the right to deny soccer fans admission into stadiums, as part of an effort to cut down on hooliganism and violence associated with the country's ""barras bravas."" Argentina's Security Ministry announced the creation of the national registry on January 28, reported AFP. The ministry will work with the Argentine Football Association (Asociacion del Futbol Argentino - AFA) to obtain information about the fan bases of each team, reported Clarin. The measure is intended to reduce violence at soccer matches and debilitate the feared soccer gangs known as ""barras bravas."" ""The primordial and immediate objective is to put an end to the violence in soccer and the problem of the barras bravas,"" the ministry said in a statement. This is not the first time that President Mauricio Macri has shown he is willing to take on the barras bravas. Just weeks after winning a hotly contested presidential election in November, Macri ordered his new security minister to ""dismantle these mafias that are the barras"" by creating an elite task force modeled after the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). As former head of the popular Argentine soccer club Boca Juniors, Macri understands as well as anyone that the barras bravas must be confronted. This term, which stretches as far back as the 1970s, initially referred to fans who congregated in order to show their loyalty to their teams by waving flags and setting off fireworks. But over the years these rabid fan groups have reportedly become increasingly involved in organized crime , and violence has become a central characteristic of their collective identity. According to non-governmental organization Salvemos al Futbol (""Let's Save Soccer""), there were an average of five soccer-related deaths per year from 2000-2009. Between 2010 and 2014, that figure doubled. However, the recent actions targeting the barras bravas fit into a larger security pattern that is beginning to emerge under the Macri administration, which is rule by decree. In mid-January, Macri's office declared a nationwide security emergency that would last for one year. This state of emergency included the authorization for the armed forces to shoot down suspected drug planes , which drew swift criticism from civil society groups and political opponents concerned about executive overreach. ""To approve by decree the shoot down of planes is an enormous institutional error that can have irreversible consequences. Much worse without debate,"" former presidential candidate Margarita Stolbizer wrote on Twitter at the time."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Paraguay Politician Gunned Down. A Paraguayan politician with ties to the cigarette industry was shot dead while driving in the Alto Parana province, close to the border with Brazil. Marcial Moran Arevalo was a local politician in the Paraguayan city of Salto del Guaira, as well as a cigarette entrepreneur. Moran was shot with a high-caliber bullet at 4 p.m. on Thursday after his car was stopped by four masked gunmen, according to reports. He was found in the driver's seat with his seatbelt still fastened. Paraguayan media said that his death could be related to his alleged connections to the smuggling of contraband cigarettes to Argentina and Brazil. As InSight has reported , the border between Paraguay and Brazil is increasingly a base of trafficking operations for Brazilian criminal groups, amongst others. 	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Pena Nieto Reveals 2014 Security Budget. Pena Nieto's proposed $4.4 billion security spending plan for 2014 allots over a third of its budget to crime prevention. Pena Nieto's 2014 budget plan of 54 billion pesos was outlined in a document sent by the Treasury Department (SHCP) to the Senate for consideration, reported Proceso. A large proportion of the budget, nearly 20 billion pesos (around $1.6 billion) will go to ""prevention and deterrence of crime."" Meanwhile, $1.4 billion will go to the penal system, $122 million to the new gendarmarie police force, and $231 million to the intelligence services. Some $382 million will be distributed to states, municipalities, and the Federal District for public security. The growth in the security budget for 2014 represents only a small increase over the projected inflation rate of 3 percent for next year, reported El Economista. Pena Nieto has made crime prevention a cornerstone of his security strategy. His administration recently announced a new national crime prevention program that will target 250 highly violent zones. If the budget for next year is approved, Pena Nieto's new police force, the gendarmarie, will receive a total of over 3.5 billion pesos (around $384 million) in 2013 and 2014. While this is a relatively small amount compared to that allotted to other public security programs and agencies, it is worrying that the government has yet to precisely define the structure and function of the new police force.

"Desperate Measures? Honduras Considers Blurring Military-Police Role. There are already concerns that Honduras' fledgling efforts at police reform are doomed to fail. But the other proposed approach -- giving the military permanent policing powers -- seems like an even worse prospect. Last week, the Honduran government extended an emergency decree, first declared in November 2011, allowing the military to conduct arrests and carry out searches without a warrant for another 90 days. Now, President Porfirio Lobo has proposed a constitutional reform that would give the military permanent policing powers. This implies that the prospect of comprehensive police reform is so hopeless in Honduras that it is more effective in the long term to shove the military in a permanent policing role. US interests may disagree. A large bloc of US lawmakers recently signed a letter calling for a pause to all security aid to Honduras, unless the country demonstrates progress in confronting human rights violations committed by the military and police. Meanwhile, the deputy undersecretary of defense for the Americas, Paul Stockton, recently told Congress that deploying the military to fight crime in Latin America is a major concern, due to the risk of human rights violations, declaring, ""The challenges of security are better faced by institutions responsible for public safety."" There are claims from within the Honduran Congress that the US government is willing to support the creation of a military police force in the country. Liberal Party representative Jose Azcona Bocock told La Prensa that the US government had ""offered"" to support the transformation of at least four army units into a specialized military police. Such a measure may prove controversial, but as Azcona argued, it would mean Honduras would no longer have to deploy the entire military in a permanent policing role. Much of the concern surrounding the permanent deployment of the military onto the streets is due to the nature of their training. Unlike the police, the military are not trained to protect civilians or conduct criminal investigations. Other lawmakers in Honduras have argued that involving the military in domestic policing could expose the army to ""contamination"" from the drug trade, although the military's record is already questionable. The question is whether there are other ways Honduras can confront police corruption without putting the military in charge of law enforcement. Congress has already passed several reforms intended to do just that, approving the creation of the Public Security Reform Commission on January 31. The independent commission will be responsible for purging the police of corrupt officers, and may also be given the power to oversee a proposed reform of the Interior Ministry. It will supervise a police body known as the DIECP, charged with investigating suspect officers. The commission will inspect the entire police force from the top down, handling cases ranging from bribery to human rights violations. It has also been granted extensive authority to review the finances of police officers. This would involve comparing the income of police officers as far back as 10 years, examining both their material and non-material assets, including those of household and family members. But these efforts at reform are already facing problems. Oscar Manuel Arita stepped down from his position as director of the DIECP on March 1 for reasons he said were ""strictly personal and family-related."" An anonymous source close to Arita told EFE that the director resigned due to a lack of the political and economic support necessary for the institution to operate successfully. His resignation may have been related to the directorate's accidental exclusion from Congress' 2012 budget. Even if this was just a clumsy omission by Congress, it shows the government is paying little attention to the DIECP, and supports the argument that this latest wave of reforms are primarily for show. Honduras has already taken some key steps towards confronting the widespread crime and violence plaguing the country. But even if the current campaign at police reform gets nowhere, granting the military permanent policing powers looks like a solution that would only cause more trouble. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Nicaragua Violence Points to Expansion of Honduras Groups. Drug trafficking groups from Honduras are reportedly fueling violence in Nicaragua's Atlantic region through their involvement in the hijacking of drug shipments, in another sign Honduran organizations are emerging as a transnational threat. According to Brigadier General Bayardo Rodriguez, the Nicaraguan army's chief of military operations, local assassination squads in the Atlantic regions are targeting so-called ""tumbadores"" -- groups engaged in stealing drug consignments -- which themselves are linked to Honduran drug trafficking organizations, reported La Prensa. The official also highlighted how illegal Honduran groups are crossing into Nicaraguan territory to escape the attention of Honduran military operations against them, with a 600 kilometer stretch of border between Bocay and Waspam witnessing significant incursions from such groups. According to Rodriguez, one of the difficulties in carrying out effective operations in the Atlantic and northern border regions is the vast expanse of inhospitable, densely vegetated terrain typical of the region. The apparent involvement of Honduran groups in hijacking drug shipments only emphasizes the volatile nature of the sort of drug trafficking found in this part of Central America. Local ""transportista"" groups receive shipments from South America, often stopping in the Caribbean on the way, destined for the Mexican cartels which transport them into the United States. At this point in the chain, operations can be something of a free-for-all and the instability breeds heightened violence among competing gangs. Honduran groups appear to be increasingly active in Nicaraguan territory, with the area known as the Miskito or commonly Mosquito Coast -- which straddles the Atlantic coastlines of both countries -- a hotbed for drug trafficking and cross-border activity from illegal groups. The region has also reportedly become a stop-off for drug flights , while illegal logging in the border area has also been linked to Honduran groups. The problem of drug trafficking between the two nations has seen bilateral agreements made in recent years, with the pair the only nations to ratify a regional convention targeting drug trafficking in October, in part driven by problem of trafficking in their common border areas. Honduran criminals linked to drug trafficking have also apparently surfaced elsewhere in the region, with Honduran passports recovered during an operation carried out against a network flying drugs into Costa Rica by helicopter ."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Dominican Anti-Drug Chief Accused of Stealing Cocaine. The head of the Dominican Republic's anti-narcotics police has been charged with stealing over a ton of cocaine, leading to allegations that the institution is so corrupt it is now one of the country's leading drug dealing operations. On January 12, Carlos Fernandez Valerio, the head of the country's anti-drug police, known as the DICAN, was charged with stealing 1.2 tons of cocaine. The drug shipments were seized during several police raids but never turned in as evidence. Also named in the indictment were two prosecutors, a police colonel, a number of low-level police officers, and several civilians, reported El Nuevo Diario. The scandal first broke in December 2014, when investigations into missing cocaine hauls led to Fernandez's suspension and eventual arrest. According to reports by El Nacional , Fernandez is believed to have headed a group of at least 21 corrupt officials, who stole drug shipments then either sold them back to transnational drug traffickers or to local drug dealers supplying the Dominican market. In the wake of the scandal, one Dominican senator labeled the DICAN the country's largest micro-trafficking cartel, while another called for the agency to be dismantled. The Dominican security forces are no stranger to corruption scandals. Both the police and the military have previously been implicated in transnational drug trafficking and micro-trafficking. However, such incidents have usually involved low and mid-level officials who were bought off by drug traffickers. In contrast, the latest scandal involves the very leaders of the agency tasked with halting the flow of drugs through the country, which is a key transit point for South American cocaine shipped into the United States. It also involves corrupt security forces running their own theft and resale operations rather than accepting the bribes of criminal organizations. Given the amount of cocaine involved, the DICAN criminal network would have been raking in significant profits. If the allegations prove true, then the DICAN would have gone far beyond the typical low-level corruption that pervades security agencies across the region, and may now no longer be fit for its purpose.	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Barrio 18 in El Salvador: A View from the Inside. A series of anonymous testimonies from Barrio 18 gang members taken by El Salvador's Attorney General's Office reveal the innards of the gang's structure, operations and rules. The testimonies come from four ""criteriados,"" or protected witnesses, whose identities are kept hidden for their protection. They are part of an indictment against 68 members of the upper echelon of the ""Revolutionaries,"" one of the Barrio 18's two factions in El Salvador, for the murder of a fellow gang member and that of a policeman, as well as an assortment of other charges. Barrio 18 is one of the two largest gangs in El Salvador. The other, the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13), is thought to be slightly larger in membership than the Barrio 18. The Barrio 18 is known as the more violent and less sophisticated of the two. Still, the gang has a hierarchy, which is delineated in the testimonies. At the top are the gang's leaders, or ""palabreros,"" in the jail system. In the case of El Salvador, the prison that holds most of them is in the municipality of Izalco, in the state of Sonsonate. However, at least one of these leaders was moved to a maximum-security prison recently after the government officially decided to stop facilitating a gang truce between the Barrio 18 and its rivals in the MS13. There, the palabreros ""coordinate all the criminal activities of the gang,"" the Attorney General's Office's account of the testimonies states. (The Attorney General's Office does not give a transcription but rather a summary of the gang members' statements, and while it gives codenames of the witnesses at the onset of the document, it does not say which of them is giving testimony in the document itself.) Barrio 18 Gang Hierarchy ""Palabreros"" in the prison system : coordinate all criminal activities. One palabrero keeps a notebook that keeps track of all finances, homicides, drugs, and weapons. ""Palabreros"" outside the prison system , aka, ""en la libre."" Leaders of the ""canchas."" A cancha is a territorial division that isn't necessarily based on municipal delineations. Each cancha has several ""tribus,"" or tribes. Leaders of the ""tribus."" There are thought to be 28 Barrio 18 ""tribus"" in El Salvador, according to one study. Each tribu leader may be responsible for dozens and perhaps hundreds of members. Collaborators: those who are not quite or never will be gang members. They help the gang with small jobs, like gathering intelligence, and moving or holding illicit goods. One of these palabreros has the ""notebook"" keeping track of the gang's activities, which include homicides, money collected from extortion, the drugs that are sold, the weapons obtained, and the money in the group. ""Everything that the other leaders [in the street] are going to do, they ask permission,"" the document states. ""Homicides, extortions, disappearing people; they [in the prison] give the go-ahead to pressure the families of protected witnesses and sometimes give the go-ahead to kill them; they are the only ones who can authorize attacks on the police."" The El Salvador online outlet El Faro, which also obtained the document and gives an accounting of its veracity , says this is consistent with its research on gangs. Since April 2014, the Revolutionaries have been involved in numerous confrontations with the police. Dozens of gang members have been killed, and more than 40 police have also been shot , many of them while off-duty. This organization may help explain the chaotic nature of the Barrio 18 in comparison to its counterpart, the MS13 The Izalco jail is controlled by the Revolutionaries, since Salvadoran authorities group prisoners by their gang affiliation. It is in this prison where those implicated in the case allegedly killed Mardoqueo Adalberto Hernandez Acevedo , alias the ""Boxer,"" because he had supposedly become an informant. One witness described how he went for a coffee and saw several gang members holding Hernandez by his legs and arms in one of the cells. It should have been difficult, since Hernandez trained many of the gang members in jail in self-defense, henceforth his nickname. But another witness says that Hernandez simply succumbed to his fate. When the one who went for a coffee came back, the Boxer was dead, the witness said. ( See another account of this murder at El Faro.) It is not clear how he died, but his alleged killers later put a noose around his neck and hung his body from the prison rafters in an attempt to fool authorities into believing that he had committed suicide. Below the palabreros in jail are the palabreros on the street, or ""en la libre,"" as they like to say in gang-speak. The Revolutionaries have at least three leaders on the street in all of El Salvador, according to the witnesses. These leaders are responsible for carrying out the orders that emanate from the jail, including organizing the extortion system and coordinating homicides. Below these palabreros are the leaders of what Barrio 18 calls ""canchas."" Canchas literally means courts or fields. One Salvadoran gang expert, Luis Amaya, contacted by InSight Crime, said that these divisions were used to delineate a large territorial space, but that they had no connection to the political borders of the country. In other words, these divisions are not based on municipal delineations but are more topographical, he said, referring to the rivers, mountains and other natural geographical boundaries. Each MS13 ""clica"" might have a few dozen members, but each Barrio 18 ""tribu"" leader would be responsible for dozens and perhaps hundreds of members. Each cancha has what are called ""tribus,"" or tribes. The tribu is a way to denote what appears to be a rather large gang cell, Amaya said. This organization may help explain the chaotic nature of the Barrio 18 in comparison to its counterpart, the MS13. In an academic work published for the Francisco Gavidia University in 2012, Amaya and another researcher, Juan Jose Martinez, cited police statistics indicating that there were 28 tribus in all of El Salvador, compared to 246 of what are called ""clicas"" for the rival MS13. Given that each of these gangs has thousands of members, it would appear that the MS13 has a far more intimate and coordinated structure, Amaya said. Each clica might have a few dozen members, but each tribu leader, for instance, would be responsible for dozens and perhaps hundreds of members, leading to numerous de facto leaders amongst the rank and file. Finally, the Barrio 18 has ""collaborators,"" those who are not quite or never will be members, who help the gang in gathering intelligence, moving or holding illicit goods, and other small jobs. All the gang members have to follow the rules established by their palabreros in the jails, the witnesses said. Barrio 18 Gang Rules Respect and attend meetings Speak the truth at the meetings Respect the ""palabreros"" Be a good example to the recently initiated members Don't walk around drunk or sleep in the streets Respect relatives of the gang members, including their girlfriends No crack, including the type coated in paint thinner Fight with the enemy, not amongst themselves Don't mention ""the letters"" [rival gang MS13] Don't use a red bandana or red hat [rival gang colors] Search out weapons for the gang Take revenge for the members who have died for the cause Don't leave any members behind Don't graffiti in red Don't talk about gang business around outsiders Members who want to tattoo their faces need to ask permission Carry out ""a mission"" before getting initiated [getting beaten up during 18 seconds by four members while another counts] Don't allow women into the gang [since the year 2000] No rape No snitching Don't talk shit about homeboys There are different punishments for violating different rules. For example, one witness says the following are punishable by death: leaving a member behind during a fight; snitching; rape. Other transgressions are met with beatings that can be 18 or 36 seconds, or without a count. In order to delineate territory, the gang marks it with graffiti, one witness said. The symbols include XVIII, BEST, 8P, and 187. According to the witness, BEST is a reference to following orders; 8P means they have killed a policeman in that area; 187 means Barrio 18 is ""killing"" seven days a week. Tattoos are also a prominent feature in Barrio 18 culture. One of them, DC8, is a reference to the biblical ""AD,"" or, as the witness described it, ""after Christ there is Barrio 18."" Another, X8, is a reference to absolute loyalty to the gang."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
Colombia Busts Alleged FARC Arms Dealer. A suspected arms trafficker whose network is accused of supplying 500 rifles to the FARC rebels has been arrested in Colombia. Carlos Enrique Pombo was arrested in Cali in a joint operation between Colombia and US law enforcement, and Interpol. US authorities accuse Pombo's network of smuggling some 500 rifles into Colombia for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group, reported El Tiempo. The accused trafficker has been operating since 2003, investigators said, when his brother and two others were arrested in Miami accepting a shipment of 50 rifles, Caracol reported. El Tiempo reported that the US Embassy in Bogota said Pombo employed people to buy the arms in parts and then smuggle them into Colombia. A Florida court has requested Pombo's extradition; following his arrest he was transferred to Bogota as part of the extradition process. The arrest could be a significant blow to the FARC, which has lost what appears to be a major trafficker of arms. However, the rebels get their weapons from a diverse range of sources. The group has also been reported to obtain arms from regional military stockpiles, as evidenced when the Colombian Army seized a rifle from a guerrilla in 2004 which had Peruvian Air Force markings. An inquiry found that it was part of a group of 165 that were supposedly destroyed, but in fact went missing from a military base in suspicious circumstances. The US has also accused high-level members of the Venezuela Armed Forces of carrying out a drugs-for-guns trade with the rebels. More recently, Colombian police said the group smuggles military-grade explosives into the country from Ecuador, where there is an ample supply of explosives used for mining. In addition, the FARC is reported to run clandestine arms factories where guerrillas assemble weapons. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
"El Mayo Rises to Lead a Sinaloa Cartel whose Future Is Uncertain. The upcoming trial in California of a high-ranking operative from Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel raises questions about the state of the vaunted drug trafficking organization, and whether the one remaining capo can maintain the criminal organization's power after a series of heavy blows. On July 11, in a San Diego courtroom, Jose Rodrigo Arechiga Gamboa, alias ""El Chino Antrax,"" pled not guilty to federal charges of conspiring to smuggle cocaine and other drugs into the US. He had been extradited to the US just a day earlier, after being arrested in Amsterdam in December 2013. El Chino Antrax was reportedly a chief enforcer of the Sinaloa Cartel and a man with close personal ties to frontman Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, making his arrest a significant blow to the organization as well as a step in the effort to nab Guzman himself, who was detained in February in Mazatlan. The arrest of El Chino Antrax and other key cogs in the Sinaloa machinery caused sudden changes in the group's communication systems, exposing them to infiltration by the authorities. The Sinaloa enforcer was also reportedly a founder and leader of a Sinaloa cell called "" Anthrax Virus ,"" and he represented a younger generation of Sinaloa leaders. Unlike many of his criminal forbears, he had no background in law enforcement, nor was he a professed rancher. According to a recent New Yorker chronicle of Guzman's arrest, El Chino Antrax was a cosmopolitan technophile: he was in Amsterdam on one of his periodic European vacations when arrested, and he spent a great deal of time online chatting with other organized crime figures. Some reports speculated after his arrest that information posted on his Instagram account might have contributed to his arrest. The trial awaiting El Chino Antrax and the downfall of other key members of the group -- including Guzman himself -- raise questions about the future of the Sinaloa Cartel. The arrest of Guzman was followed in June by reports that Juan Jose ""El Azul"" Esparragoza, another of the triumvirate of top Sinaloa bosses, had suffered a heart attack. Other old-time Sinaloa leaders have also disappeared from the scene, like Arturo Beltran Leyva, who was killed in December 2009 following a split with Guzman, and Ignacio Coronel, who was killed in July 2010. These developments over the past year appear to have lifted Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, the lone remaining Sinaloa capo, into a position of unparalleled power within the cartel, but it's not clear how much the organization that he controls resembles the one that has dominated the nation's criminal landscape for the past decade. With the demise of his contemporaries, both in Sinaloa and in other regions, Zambada may now be the country's most powerful drug lord, but he is taking over an organization that is in flux. While they were allies for decades, it is not known how much overlap there was between the networks within Sinaloa that were controlled by Zambada and those controlled by his colleagues. It could be that Guzman and Esparragoza had a network of subordinates willing to respond only to them, in which case their departure could mean the fracturing of the cartel. The Sinaloa Cartel has been plagued by reports of infighting for years, and the rumors seem to have intensified recently. Hundreds of dead bodies discovered in clandestine graves in 2011 in Durango were attributed to battles between a Chihuahua-based Sinaloa offshoot and their erstwhile bosses. More recently, the arrest of several Zambada lieutenants, including his son Serafin Zambada, led to reports of open conflict between Guzman and Zambada themselves. It is not clear how much truth there is to the rumors, but they are a sign of tension and perhaps even decay within the organization. Moreover, with Zambada ascending months after the arrest of El Chino Antrax and Zambada's son, it is unclear who he will rely on for the organization's day-to-day operations. Reports indicate that the organization in general and Zambada in particular were heavily reliant on El Chino Antrax, Serafin Zambada, and Gonzalo Inzunza Inzunza (killed by Mexican troops in December). Replacing three key lieutenants and two kingpins in a six-month period is a tall order, sure to test the strength of any organization."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Honduras New Human Trafficking Law Faces Enormous Challenges. A new anti-human trafficking law is supposed to reduce Honduras' importance as a source country for the sex trade, but will likely face many challenges in its implementation thanks to the country's inefficient, corrupt police and judicial system. On May 22, members of the Honduran National Congress officially signed decree 59-2012, a new anti-human trafficking law that is the country's most comprehensive to date. As the US State Department points out , previous legislation in Honduras mainly focused on child sex trafficking, but the new law sets out more formal penalties for the crimes of forced labor, organ trafficking, and the forced prostitution of adults, with convicted human traffickers facing up to 20 years in prison. The renewed focus on forced prostitution is particularly welcome. This appears to be the most widespread human trafficking crime in Honduras, a key source country for Central America's sex trade. According to 2010 statistics , 60 percent of the victims who received assistance from Honduras' chief human trafficking protection program had been subjected to commercial sexual exploitation. A documentary by journalist Ramita Navai (see video below), aired last week on the UK's Channel 4, highlighted the extent of Honduras' sex trafficking problem. In the northwest city of El Progreso, Navai found that hundreds of Honduran women had been ""disappeared,"" likely forced to work as prostitutes in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. Traffickers reportedly lured their victims, often poor females, with the promise they would be moving to Mexico for well-paid jobs. Once there, however, they were immediately sold into sex slavery and forced by their ""owners"" to work in bars and brothels as prostitutes without pay. Sex trafficking is now so lucrative an industry that the International Organization on Migration estimates *it*brings in $16 billion a year for Latin American criminals. In one indication of the trade's profitability, an alleged former trafficker told Navai that he was able to sell up to 40 Honduran girls a day in Mexico for $100 each. As the documentary highlights, once the victims had been captured, they were subjected to endless psychological and physical abuse. This included threats that if they escaped, their families would be harmed, and that if they refused to work, they would be raped and beaten. These are familiar tactics employed by sex traffickers throughout the region and ensure that the women are too afraid to attempt to flee. As one Honduran victim told Navai , once the traffickers have ""broken you in,"" there is no escape, physically or mentally. The former Honduran consul in Chiapas, Patricia Villamil, stated that during her eight months in office, Mexican authorities received some 200 calls from Honduran females claiming they were victims of sex trafficking. This probably only represents a fraction of the total victims, as many are likely too afraid to attempt to contact help. And only few of those who actually reached out to Mexican authorities were rescued.*Villamil was removed from her job *in June 2011, when she began to receive death threats, which she says may have been linked to her criticism of Mexico's inability to properly confront the human trafficking problem. While Chiapas appears to be a major destination for Honduran trafficking victims, it is by no means the only one. Many women are forced into prostitution in neighboring countries such as Nicaragua and Guatemala. Some are even sent further. For example, a sex trafficking ring dismantled by Honduran authorities last year allegedly trafficked its victims to Europe and the United States, and there have even been reports of unsuspecting Hondurans shipped to Romania , forced to work without pay once they arrived.*All of this highlights the extensive reach of networks operating out of the Central American state. Honduras' endemically high poverty rate makes the country attractive ground for traffickers. Statistics from the Central Intelligence Agency's World Fact Book show that in 2010, 65 percent of Hondurans lived below the poverty line. This alarmingly high number gives traffickers an enormous opportunity to exploit people's needs for money with false offers of work abroad. What's more, since the coup in 2009, Honduras' economy has disintegrated further, as Navai noted, rendering any prospect of a foreseeable improvement slim. Compounding this problem is the apparent move by traffickers into targeting the middle-class as well as the poor. A La Tribuna report from last year found that traffickers were turning their attention to affluent urban women, luring them into the global sex trade with advertisements promising a successful modelling or dance career. These increasingly sophisticated methods will be a significant challenge to Honduran authorities as they try to implement the new law. In order to become fully effective, decree 59-2012 must still be signed by President Porfirio Lobo. As of last week, Lobo had somewhat surprisingly still not sanctioned the law , leading Save the Children and the Spanish International Cooperation and Development Agency (AECID) to publicly call for him to do so. However, in light of his wife's presence at the May 22 signing, along with her championing of the legislation, it is highly unlikely he would send the bill back to Congress. Provided Lobo's delay is nothing more than short-term feet dragging, Honduras must turn its attention to how the law will be made effective. While its extensive coverage and punitive measures against traffickers are vital steps, seeing Honduras' police force and judicial system implement it properly will be another, arguably more difficult task. Impunity rates in Honduras hover around the 90 percent mark and the police have a notorious reputation for corruption and links to the very criminal structures they are supposed to be fighting. Unless these issues are addressed alongside putting the law into practice, any potential progress in countering human trafficking in Honduras will likely stall. "	0	1	1	0	0	0	1
"Arizona Border Militia Spurred by Myth of Spillover Violence. Fears in Arizona about Mexican cartel violence spilling into the US have led to a proposal for a new border militia, whose purpose and accountability are both highly questionable. Last week, the Arizona Senate Appropriations Committee passed Bill 1083 by a vote of 7-6, bringing the creation of a volunteer border militia in Arizona one step closer. According to the text of the bill, the militia, named the Arizona Special Missions Unit, would be ""established for the purpose of securing the safety and protection of the lives and property of the citizens of this state."" Their role would be to help local authorities to arrest individuals engaged in cross-border criminal activity. The original proposal put the unit under the operations of the National Guard. However, the revised text that was recently approved had this element removed , instead putting the unit under a governor-appointed commander. If signed into law, the unit would be comprised of 300 volunteers who will receive 40 hours of police training, learning how to pursue, detain and arrest suspects. In theory, each volunteer will have to go through a vetting process. Two elements immediately stand out that would make the proposed unit unique. First, though there are currently 23 other states in the US with active guard units, the Arizona unit would be the only one with a primary focus on international crime, according to the Associated Press. Secondly, existing guard units in the US typically fall under the command of the National Guard; in Arizona, however, it appears as if the unit would be to some extent self-governing. This move to disregard the norms of voluntary border patrol units raises a question -- why do Arizona officials deem it necessary to arm a voluntary militia with seemingly unilateral powers? The Republican governor of Arizona, Jan Brewer, has so far refrained from commenting on the bill. However, her fellow party members have come out as some of its biggest proponents, arguing that it is necessary in the face of incursions by Mexican cartels into Arizona. As Sylvia Allen, a Republican Senator from Snowflake, AZ, stated, ""Something has to be done about the situation at the border -- people are being terrorized."" In a separate commentary she added , ""We are being invaded by criminals who have formed alliances with mid-eastern terrorists to use violence in the most evil of ways to intimidate, control and protect their drug, human smuggling, multi-billion dollar business."" Arizona shares a 370-mile long border with Mexico, thus making it an inevitable transit point for drugs and other illicit activity stemming mainly from Mexico. Last year, US authorities dismantled a smuggling operation allegedly run by the Sinaloa Cartel that trafficked roughly $2 billion worth of drugs through the Arizona desert over a five-year period. However, the claim from Arizona state officials that their populations are being terrorized by these trafficking operations comes up short when looking at the data. Like Senator Allen now, Brewer declared in 2010, ""We cannot sacrifice our safety to the murderous greed of cartels. We cannot stand idly by as drop houses, kidnappings and violence compromise our quality of life."" As the New York Times reported , Brewer was wildly off the mark. Arizona's population has indeed swelled as a result of illegal immigration, but the incidence of violent crime in the state in fact declined over the last decade, from 532 incidents per 100,000 inhabitants in 2000 to 408 in 2010. Given these facts, the arguments for the creation of an Arizona militia rest on a shaky premise. The US Department of Justice's 2011 National Drug Threat Assessment also calls the proposed unit into question. Though Mexican gangs traffic large quantities of drugs -- over 90 percent of which is marijuana -- through remote points of entry (POE) in Arizona, they are increasingly turning their operations to ultralight aircraft in order to avoid border security, with smuggling operations by air on the rise since 2008. The unit also has the potential to set a dangerous precedent in US border security. Arizona already has a checkered history of border control thanks in part to the famed Minutemen vigilante organization that sprung up in the state in 2005 to tackle illegal immigration. One of the organization's members, Shawna Forde, was convicted last year for the murder of a Latino man, Raul Junior Flores, and his 9-year-old daughter in 2009. Forde reportedly believed Flores to be a drug trafficker. Some, including Senator Steve Gallardo (D-Phoenix), warn that the Arizona Special Missions Unit could follow the same lawless path of the Minutemen. Though this may be unfair, there are risks in arming a few hundred volunteers with only minimal training in issues of border control. For example, in comparison to the required 40 hours for service in the militia, normal police officers must undergo 500 hours of training. As Arizona's adjutant general of the National Guard stated , ""I do have concerns about weapons There's a lot of things that have to occur before I feel comfortable putting a weapon in a volunteer's hand."" Furthermore, questions are beginning to be asked over the funding for the unit. Coming in at a relatively low, $1.4 million per year, the finances would be taken from Arizona's Gang and Immigration Intelligence Team Enforcement Mission (GIITEM). GIITEM currently uses the funds to purchase weapons in Arizona's fight against crime, and it does not seem clear that the state would be more secure if it was spent on a border militia. As the Arizona Daily Star argues , ""This kind of legislation makes for good political sound bites but it does nothing to address the complex challenges of securing the US-Mexico border."" SB 1083 is still in the early stages and needs to meet the approval of the Arizona State House and the Senate before Governor Brewer can sign it into law. With so many issues around the bill and its potential consequences, it seems better to leave the battle against any ""terror"" coming from Mexico to the professionals. "	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Blocks Prison Cellphones in Attempt to Cut Extortion. Authorities in El Salvador are attempting to block cellphone signals in the country's prisons, a measure that if succesfully implemented could cut extortion and hamper criminal activities coordinated by imprisoned gang leaders. Of the 19 prisons in El Salvador, ten have already installed new cellphone signal-blocking technology and four others are in the process of receiving the equipment, according to El Diario De Hoy. Security Minister Ricardo Perdomo said the 14 prisons selected to receive the new technology have the largest prison populations, and that the measure -- proposed in the past but never successfully implemented -- should reduce extortion calls coming from inside prisons. Just last November, 90 cellphones were found in a random sweep of a single prison. In addition to blocking cellphone signals, the new equipment will also remove access to the Internet and, in turn, social networks. Incarcerated gang members, including those convicted of murder, have been found using Facebook and have been shown to have contact with other imprisoned gang members through the network. In Honduras, a similar plan has been implemented, with cellphone signals blocked in all 24 of the country's prisons since February. The problem of cellphones entering and being used inside El Salvador's prisons has long been known but has not been easy to solve, as many facilities are repurposed public buildings used to house a prison population that exploded during the country's years of hard-line policies against gangs. As a result, many still have electrical outlets that prisoners use to recharge cellphones and other electronics. The gangs are also largely in charge of the prisons , which are overcrowded and have a limited number of guards, making it difficult to keep cellphones out of gang members' hands. The idea of blocking cellphone signals was first proposed by outgoing president Mauricio Funes in 2009 but has yet to be implemented successfully. While it is not specified what type of technology El Salvador is using to block signals, it is most likely installing ""managed access"" technology, which can establish a radio-frequency umbrella around a prison and intercept signals from unapproved wireless devices , or jamming technology that interferes with the frequency. The other route, taken by Honduras, is to have cellular providers remove their signals around the prisons. But this method is much blunter and has denied service to citizens living near the prisons. However, Honduras has credited the removal of the cellphone signals with a 75 percent reduction in extortions , and El Salvador is likely hoping for a similar outcome."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Why Police Reforms Rarely Succeed: Lessons From Latin America. As discussions about police reform abound throughout the Americas, Yanilda Gonzalez, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago, examines the implications of Latin America's experience with police reform efforts for future such initiatives. US President Donald Trump's appointment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions has led people to speculate about the fate of recent police reform efforts. Early into his tenure, Sessions said he intended to ""pull back on"" the Justice Department's investigations of police department abuses, saying they diminish effectiveness. *This story is republished with permission from The Conversation. It does not necessarily represent the views of InSight Crime. See the original article here. Americans have mobilized extensively in the past three years against police brutality, militarization and corruption through the Black Lives Matter and related movements. Government officials at the federal level have responded to these demands by creating specialized task forces to recommend best practices, and investigating troubled police departments and enforcing reforms. Courts have also worked to roll back unconstitutional stop-and-frisk policies , while city governments have created independent oversight agencies and enacted robust community policing programs. But will it stick? My research on police reform in Latin America shows that such reforms are highly vulnerable to political reversals. These cases reveal how they can be quickly rolled back before they can take hold and demonstrate results. Understanding the politics of police reform in Latin America may be informative for those who hope for changes in policing in the United States. Police Reform and Politics Leaders in Colombia and Buenos Aires Province, Argentina , overhauled their police institutions in 1993 and 1998, respectively. These reforms were a response to rising crime rates, as well as pervasive police violence, corruption and ineffectiveness in fighting crime. Comprehensive police reform laws were crafted through broad political consensus. Lawmakers in the Colombian congress and the Buenos Aires provincial legislature enacted sweeping legislation to demilitarize, decentralize and professionalize Colombia's National Police and the Police of Buenos Aires Province. The reforms also improved recruitment standards and training, strengthened oversight agencies and created formal spaces for community participation. Only one year after reforms were passed, however, Ernesto Samper was elected president of Colombia. He vowed to undermine his predecessor's dramatic overhaul of the National Police, saying his government would "" let the police regulate itself ."" Similarly in Buenos Aires Province, Carlos Ruckauf was elected governor in 1999. He left his predecessor's police reform legislation intact. However, he made his preferred approach to crime-fighting clear: "" We have to hit the criminals with bullets ."" Both politicians used citizens' concerns over rising crime to lead calls for greater police autonomy, in order to be ""tougher"" on crime. Under their administrations, hard-fought police reform gave way to periods of "" counter-reform ."" These were characterized by increased police autonomy, weakened accountability, militarization, unchecked corruption and extrajudicial killings. Other research on policing in Latin America has provided compelling evidence of the impact of such political rhetoric. When politicians promoting ""tougher"" police strategies are elected, police killings and repression of citizens increase. These examples reveal how the long-term aims of police reforms can be difficult to reconcile with the short-term goals of politicians. Police Support for Reform My research also demonstrates that police forces that are resistant to reforms have considerable power to undermine them. In Buenos Aires Province, police officials succeeded in dismantling a system of neighborhood security forums that allowed citizens to conduct oversight of police. Police officials felt the forums gave citizens too much control over police affairs. As a result, they lobbied the governor and security minister to reduce the funding and staff needed to implement them. By contrast, a similar participatory system in Sao Paulo, Brazil, has endured for three decades. There, police are incorporated into the governance structure of the community councils, allowing for a more collaborative relationship. As a result, many police officers have come to see forum members as their advocates. Although citizens in Sao Paulo do not have oversight authority, the police's cooperation has contributed to the persistence of these participatory spaces. Thus, reformers must identify and bolster police officials with a stake in sustaining reforms. Without support from insiders, reform is unlikely to last. Sustaining Momentum Police reform is also made vulnerable by the fact that, after reform passes, its proponents demobilize. In Buenos Aires and Colombia, human rights and activist organizations remained active when politicians began to reverse reforms. But the broadly shared societal outrage that led to reform in the first place dissipated. With it went the momentum needed to sustain reform in the long term. Research from both the United States and Latin America has shown that campaigning for ""tough on crime"" policies, or "" penal populism ,"" is a highly successful strategy for winning elections. As scholars have shown, such policies can generate broad support among a diverse set of voters. So-called ""pro-order"" coalitions , the collection of civil society organizations, media outlets and politicians that advocate for "" law and order "" policies, have similarly demonstrated great capacity to mobilize resources and public support. Failing to sustain reform coalitions means there is little counterweight to these pressures. 'Counter-Reform' in the US? Is the United States entering a period of ""counter-reform"" similar to that observed in Colombia and Argentina? Opponents of reform, including Sessions , warn of ""a longer-term trend of violent crime going up."" They have also floated theories such as the "" Ferguson effect ,"" the idea that growing scrutiny of police activity has made police more timid. Such arguments may scare voters into believing that police reform may make police less effective in fighting crime. Meanwhile, President Trump has engaged in rhetoric similar to his Colombian and Argentine counterparts. As a candidate, he called on police to be "" very much tougher "" in fighting crime. As president, he has said his will be "" a law-and-order administration "" that will ""empower"" police. It is too early to tell whether these police reform efforts will backslide. While the US context differs in some ways from Latin America, these examples demonstrate that police reform is a continuous and contentious process that is difficult to achieve and highly prone to reversal. *This story is republished with permission from The Conversation.

Bolivia Hits Record Coca Eradication As Cocaine Seizures Fall. Bolivia has destroyed 11,407 hectares of coca in 2013, surpassing its previous record by over 300 hectares, indicating that eradication has continued apace despite illicit coca growers' attempts to slow the process. Deputy Minister for Social Defense Felipe Caceres said the increase was achieved with the help of an additional $36 million put towards the eradication of illegal coca in 2013. The bulk of operations were carried out in the coca-growing regions of Los Yungas, La Paz; Chapare, Cochabamba; and Yapacani, Santa Cruz, reported La Razon. The country achieved record eradication in 2012 , destroying 11,035 hectares. While eradication is up, seizures of cocaine and coca base fell 42 percent compared to 2012, from 36.3 tons to 20.9 tons, according to the director of anti-narcotics police unit FELCN, Mario Centellas. According to Centellas, the FELCN prioritized the detection of laboratories in the 13,264 operations carried out over the course of 2013, destroying 62 cocaine laboratories and 48 laboratories dedicated to the recycling of precursor chemicals. Earlier this year, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported that coca production in Bolivia dropped seven percent between 2011 and 2012, partly due to eradication efforts and partly to a drop in yield. The 2013 figures indicate that this trend is set to continue, despite anti-eradication uprisings by coca growers this year in the Apolo region of La Paz. Much of the credit for this must lie with the President Evo Morales, who remains head of a major coca growers union. In contrast to eradication efforts in other coca producing countries, Morales has achieved reductions through negotiating with coca growers and working on establishing a legal market. However, the limitations of this approach were demonstrated by a recently published Bolivian government study , which found only 14,705 hectares of coca were needed to satisfy the country's legal demand -- some way below the 25,300 hectares produced in 2012. The simultaneous drop in seizures is unsurprising, considering the country's lack of radar technology to interdict rising drug flights. Former FELCN head Colonel Gonzalo Quezada, who was replaced earlier this year, tempered supply-side disadvantages by targeting production; an approach that appears to be continuing under Centellas. Bolivia's mixed successes come as Colombia has missed its 2013 coca eradication goals by half , sparking concerns of a renewed rise in production. Peru, meanwhile reported breaking its eradication record in 2013, but simultaneously emerged as the world's biggest coca producer.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"InSight Map: Major Prison Breaks in Mexico. In the latest of a series of prison breaks, on Monday fourteen inmates escaped from a penal center in Chihuahua, Mexico, where drug violence has led criminal syndicates like the Zetas to attempt multiple bold raids on the country's prisons. El Universal reports that the men escaped from Aguiles Serden penitentiary after guards were distracted by gunfire, just before an armored vehicle rammed through the outer chain-link fence on the building's west side. The vehicle drove 80 meters to the prison's inner wall, about 15 inches thick and made of brick, where the inmates slipped through a gap and climbed into the car. So far the raid appears to have been mostly facilitated by poor security conditions, including a non-electrified fence just two meters high, rather than collusion with prison guards, who are typically involved in these types of escapes. The investigation, however, is ongoing. Authorities did manage to recapture five of the escaped inmates Tuesday during a manhunt. Prison guards at Aguiles Serden have previously been targeted for assassination, in what could be interpreted as evidence of corruption within the prison, as the hit was likely a vengeance killing after the officials did not collaborate with inmate demands. The Chihuahua prison is an important holding center for gang operatives arrested in Ciudad Juarez, but most inmates are first-time offenders rather than top-level traffickers. These include street dealers or ex-security detail formerly employed by the city's many street gangs, in particular the Aztecas and their rivals the Mexicles. It is the site of frequent riots between groups of inmates, indicating that, much like Ciudad Juarez, a criminal organization has not yet consolidated control of the prison's illicit businesses. Violence within Aguiles Serden was so severe that in November, authorities transferred 62 inmates out of the facility, prompting the state attorney general to call the detention center ""a time bomb."" It is not yet clear whether the Zetas were involved with the Chihuahua escape, but, as indicated by the map below created by InSight showing major prison busts in 2010, the Zetas seemingly masterminded some of last year's most dramatic security breaks. Many of the major escapes were concentrated in one facility, the Reynosa Corrections Center, known by its acronym CEDES. What this appears to emphasize is the hold that the Zetas have over the security forces in Tamaulipas. In one escape from CEDES in September, when 86 inmates used a ladder to jump a wall, this shows a high level of collaboration from corrections officers and the local police force, who do not push through with a serious manhunt. It is not clear whether a single, powerful group in the Aguiles Serden penitentiary in Chihuahua has managed to be as effective at corrupting prison authorities as the Zetas have been in Tamaulipas. Again, as indicated by the riots and violence prevalent within Aguiles Serden, power struggles between the Juarez gangs (and probably elements of the Sinaloa Cartel as well) means that, while there is almost certainly corruption here, a single group is not dominant here in the way that Zetas appear to dominate CEDES. As indicated by the map below, the most serious security breach in 2010 happened in December 17, when an armed commando of alleged Zetas managed to free 151 prisoners from a facility outside Nuevo Laredo.

Ex-Police Commander in Rio Took $8,600 a Week in Bribes. A former commander in Brazil's UPP police unit was arrested on drug trafficking charges in Rio de Janeiro, the latest allegation of corruption to dog the highly praised force. According to O Globo , the former head of Rio's Pacifying Police Unit (Unidade de Policia Pacificadora - UPP), based in the San Carlos favela, was among the 11 people arrested by anti-narcotics police on Thursday. A member of the military police was also among those arrested. Authorities told O Globo that as of November 2011, the UPP captain was no longer part of the force. He is charged with accepting about 15,000 Brazilian reais (about $8,675) each week in bribes from a local drug trafficker. On one hand, the arrest is a sign that authorities are continuing to root out corrupt elements in the UPP. The elite police force has been presented as a successful community policing model deployed across Rio de Janeiro's favelas. But the program has shown cracks. The city's police force, including many UPP officers, temporarily threatened to strike just before Carnaval celebrations, complaining they were forced to work up to 70 hours a week for low salaries. The strike was called off after Rio's state assembly approved a 13 percent salary raise, which was only about half what the police officers demanded. The low salaries help explain why some corrupt officers may opt to accept bribes from criminals. Rio de Janeiro currently has 19 UPP units deployed across the city. 	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Timeline: Revelations from the Raul Reyes Computers. With a British think tank set to publish a WikiLeaks-style database of unedited computer documents seized from the camp of FARC commander ""Raul Reyes,"" InSight looks at the chronology of information released from the files so far. When the Colombian authorities bombed Raul Reyes' camp on March 1, 2008, they seized three laptops, two external hard disks and three USB drives, containing a huge quantity of digital information. Since then the revelations have flowed from the files, first in a rush and then, in more recent years, in a drip. The International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) is set to release all ""relevant"" e-mails on a searchable CD-ROM on May 10, along with a report analyzing the data and what it shows about the FARC's development and relationships with Venezuela and Ecuador. The report and files together can be purchased for PS40 ($66). The question now is whether new information will be revealed in this report. The likely answer is not much; a U.S. diplomatic cable released recently by WikiLeaks showed how methodical and organized the Colombian government has been in its use of the seized files. In the communication, sent only weeks after the bomb attack, U.S. officials reported that the Uribe administration planned to selectively leak information to foreign and domestic press that would tie the Ecuadorean and Venezuelan governments to the rebel group. One government official is named as the person chosen to plan and implement this ""computer exploitation strategy."" Given all this forward planning, it is improbable that there remains much of great interest in the files that has not already been made public, at least regarding the topics of greatest importance to Colombia; namely the guerrillas' links with foreign governments. However, there may still be pieces of information that it has not yet become opportune for Colombia to make public. The most recent nugget released by the government was that the FARC, apparently, wrote to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in 2000, seeking funds to buy ground-to-air missiles. The timing of this latest piece of information, coinciding with the crisis in Libya, suggest that there may remain similarly inconsequential details in the files which have not been revealed. Uribe allies claim that there are more revelations to come. ""What we know so far is only the tip of the iceberg, soon the details of the relations of the FARC with Venezuela, Ecuador, and with Colombian and North American politicians will be known,"" said former Uribe advisor Jose Obdulio Gaviria, according to El Nuevo Heraldo. The thinking behind publishing the files via the IISS is also explained in the WikiLeaks cable, which says that Colombia plans to ask an international organization, not affiliated with the government, to publish the files once they have been verified as genuine by Interpol. Below is InSight's timeline of the the biggest revelations, and their repercussions, that have emerged from the seized computer disks so far. FARC computers on Dipity. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"32 Tons of Marijuana Seized in New Narco-Tunnel Discovery. The U.S. Border Patrol seized 32 tons of marijuana and arrested six people in connection with the discovery of the most sophisticated narco-tunnel ever found, which runs between Tijuana and San Diego. The tunnel spans the border between the Tijuana airport and a San Diego industrial area and is the second to be found in as many weeks, reports the Washington Post. The marijuana seizure ranks among the largest in U.S. history: 17 tons discovered in a warehouse within the industrial park, 11 found in a truck near Los Angeles and four tons that had not yet been smuggled across the border. The narco-tunnel was engineered with lighting, ventilation, electric rail cars and an elevator, like others discovered this year in California and Arizona. Drug enforcement agents explain that the narco-tunnels provide an efficient way to move massive amounts of marijuana produced after Mexico's fall harvest into the U.S. market before the traditional Christmas ""break"" from drug smuggling. Authorities seized 17 tons of marijuana from another Tijuana-San Diego tunnel in mid-November. See video report by the Telegraph, below. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Top Dominican Republic Officials Imprisoned Pending Odebrecht Trial. Several top officials in the Dominican Republic have been remanded to pretrial detention for alleged ties with a massive graft scandal involving Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht, in a case that illustrates what made the island nation so ripe for corruption.* Judge Francisco Ortega issued pretrial measures on June 7 for all fourteen of the high-profile suspects implicated in the Odebrecht scandal until their case is heard, reported El Nuevo Diario. Ten of them, including Trade Minister Temistocles Montas, as well as other former ministers, prominent opposition figures, businessmen and executives of state-owned companies, were arrested on May 29. Dominican authorities have charged the suspects with money laundering, submitting false statements and bribery in connection with the $92 million in illicit payments that representatives of the Brazilian company shelled out to Dominican officials in exchange for securing 17 public work contracts worth a total value of $163 million between 2001 and 2014. Odebrecht, Brazil's largest construction firm, admitted last year that it had paid nearly $800 million in bribes to officials in a dozen countries in exchange for help winning bids for public works contracts. Minister Montas resigned after his arrest, but has denied wrongdoings as well as several other defendants, reported Reuters. The Dominican Republic's Attorney General's Office (Procuraduria General de la Republica - PGR) also issued a warrant for the arrest of another suspect , currently in Panama, and sought to revoke the parliamentary immunity of three sitting senators also implicated in the corruption scandal. According to El Nuevo Diario, Judge Ortega ordered nine of the fourteen suspects be sent to prison and sentenced another two to house arrest until their case is heard. Immunity for the sitting senators was not lifted, but the three were ordered to pay $100,000 in bail each, and were barred from leaving the country. ""We can qualify this as an unprecedented event because of the multitude of crimes and the position of power of those involved,"" said Attorney General Jean Alain Rodriguez in comments reported by the Associated Press on May 29. The trial is expected to start in eight months. The Dominican Republic was particularly susceptible to Odebrecht bribes because the Brazilian company had no competitors in the country, and high levels of corruption among elites made it easy for Odebrecht representatives to win large infrastructure contracts. ""A giant like Odebrecht didn't have any real competitor in a small country like the Dominican Republic,"" the correspondent for the Associated Press in the country, Ezequiel Abiu Lopez, told InSight Crime. Indeed, of all the countries infiltrated by Odebrecht the Dominican Republic received the third largest amount of bribes. The $92 million in bribes paid to Dominican officials earned Odebrecht an estimated $163 million in public works contracts, a return of $1.7 million in profits for every $1 million in bribes. While the figures are significantly smaller than those recorded in Brazil, where authorities estimate Odebrecht gained $4 million in contracts for every $1 million paid out to politicians, they are nonetheless significant. But the ease with which Odebrecht could infiltrate the Dominican Republic also owes to structural issues that facilitate corruption among the elite. ""Local officials found in Odebrecht a gold mine through which they could finance their electoral campaigns,"" Abiu Lopez observed. ""And it is crucial to stress that the country does not have a law that forces political parties to reveal the sources of funding for their campaigns."" The extent to which corruption has infected Dominican politics is exemplified by the fact that a man responsible for investigation corruption was himself implicated in the graft scandal. Cesar Sanchez, whom President Danilo Medina appointed to investigate the alleged inflated costs of the Punta Catalina power plant, a large infrastructure project whose contract had been won by Odebrecht, was among the suspects arrested on May 29. And while Attorney General Rodriguez may be right in touting this week's operation as unprecedented -- as no country official had been formally arrested in connection with the scandal until May 29 -- Dominican prosecutors have moved more slowly compared to other countries in the region. According to Abiu Lopez, this might have been a deliberate political decision by the ruling Dominican Liberation Party (Partido de la Liberacion Dominicana - PLD) party. ""It is possible that the PLD was trying to reduce the political impact [of the investigations] on the government, while deciding which of the officials and members of the party could be sent to court, in order to reduce people's criticism."" But people also fear the investigations won't uncover the full extent of corruption among elites in the country. Indeed, Rodriguez, a PLD member, has already struck a deal with Odebrecht, ensuring the company will pay a $184 million fine for the crimes committed in the Dominican Republic, and will commit to disclosing information on local bribe recipients in exchange for not having its executives prosecuted. Civil society groups have already emerged to call for tougher actions against corrupted officials, including the Green Movement, which has called for an independent probe into the graft scheme. * UPDATE, June 9: This article has been updated to clarify several points in the analysis."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Argentine Officials Complicit in Cocaine Lab Ring. A former government advisor has asserted that corrupt officials have allowed a Peruvian-run criminal group to flourish in Buenos Aires and produce millions of dollars worth of cocaine. The criminal group has roughly 300 members and controls 15 blocks in Buenos Aires, from which it produces and distributes drugs, Jorge Rodriguez, former advisor to Argentina's Security Ministry, said in an interview with local newspaper El Tribuno. Although it began with small-scale cocaine smuggling, the group now operates 12 labs in Buenos Aires, which produce powdered cocaine and a form of crack cocaine know locally as ""paco."" Supplied by coca paste from Bolivia, the labs can produce a combined total of up to $2 million worth of drugs per day, Rodriguez said. ""This is a complex production that could not be done without Peruvian know-how and the support of elements within the government,"" Rodriguez told the newspaper. The former advisor went on to claim that the criminal group was paying a high-ranking Argentine security official upwards of $2 million for protection. Rodriguez was responsible for investigating Buenos Aires' drug trafficking groups and their connections with the police between 2011 and 2013. He has previously said that he produced hundreds of reports about the city's drug trade and police corruption, and that ""no one did absolutely anything with my work."" He now works for an Argentine non-governmental organization, which published a report earlier this year describing the operations of the alleged Peruvian criminal group and its cocaine labs. According to Rodriguez, 30 to 50 percent of the criminal group's drug production goes to foreign markets, contributing to Argentina's rank as the world's third-largest exporter of narcotics. Shipments are largely handled by Mexican and Italian groups, who move planes loaded with cocaine into North Africa, and then smuggle the drugs into Europe, he said. While Rodriguez' claims must be weighed against any possible grudge he may have with his previous employers, many of the former advisor's assertions coincide with documented changes in Argentina's drug trade. InSight Crime has previously noted the increased importance of Argentina and Brazil as export points for Bolivian and Peruvian cocaine moving to Europe through North Africa. At the same time, both of these export nations have seen their domestic drug consumption increase. This growing market has created a lucrative trade in Argentina, which foreign criminal groups are reported to be violently competing over. Particularly concerning is Rodriguez' claim that drug traffickers are operating under the protection of corrupt security officials. Investigating and punishing corrupt officials is key if Argentina hopes to address its growing involvement in the drug trade, which has been linked to a steady rise in homicides over the last five years."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"A War Fought by Assassins: Ioan Grillo on Mexicos Crime Scenes. This extract from Ioan Grillo's new book ""El Narco"" features reporting from the type of crime scene that is all too common in today's Mexico, where the slaying of five police at a stop light only makes a brief item in local newspapers. ""El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency,"" features reporting from the frontline of Mexico's drug war. The following excerpt is set in Culiacan, capital of Sinaloa, the northwestern state that is home to the Sinaloa Cartel and is known as the cradle of Mexican drug smuggling. ""A killer arrived in Hell, To inspect his work, Without knowing that his dead, Were already waiting for him, He just went through the door, And there began his end."" - Grupo Cartel, ""A Killer Arrived in Hell,"" Twenty seconds of shooting. Four hundred and thirty-two bullets. Five dead policemen. Four of the corpses sprawl over a shiny-new Dodge Ram pickup truck that has been pierced by so many caps it resembles a cheese grater. The cadavers are twisted and contorted in the unnatural poses of the dead; arms arch backward over spines, legs spread out sideways; the pattern of bodies that fall like rag dolls when bullets strike. After arriving at too many murder scenes, I often felt numb staring at the lead-filled flesh spread out on the concrete, dirt roads and car seats. The images all blur into one. But then little details come back: the twists of elbows over backs, heads over shoulders. It is these patterns that come into my mind when I think about the murder scenes; and these patterns then filter into bad dreams when I am sleeping in a bed a thousand miles away. This particular crime scene is on a sweaty December evening in Culiacan, Sinaloa. The state policemen had hit a red stop light next to a shopping center when the triggermen attacked. BANG. BANG. BANG. The assassins shoot from the side and back unleashing bullets in split seconds. A customized Kalashnikov with a circular clip can unload 100 rounds in 10 seconds. This is lightning war. People tend to shudder at the fact that Mexican gangsters have rocket-propelled grenades. But the AK is far more lethal. The fifth dead policeman is a muscular forty-eight year old commander laying ten feet away from the pickup, bathing in his own blood. His right hand is stretched upward clasping a 9-mm pistol, creating a death pose that could have been set up for a Hollywood movie. When the hit men sprayed, the commander had managed to jump out and run, pistol in hand. But the killers followed him with their shower of bullets, finishing him off by the edge of the sidewalk. The commander has hard features, with high cheekbones and a broad nose over a finely trimmed moustache. His eyes are wide open staring at the Heavens. The left side of his face, just above his neck, is ripped open by a Kalashnikov bullet, distorting his visage with a gaping hole. Up close, it somehow looks like a rubber mask rather than the face of a real human being. Death is hard to comprehend. We arrive 10 minutes after the shooting and the police have yet to cordon off the area or cover the bodies with plastic sheets. Soon the block will be swarming with soldiers manning mounted machine guns, ski-masked homicide police and forensic teams. But for now we can walk all over the bullet-shells and stick our cameras to the faces of the victims. A crowd of onlookers thickens on the street. Four young teenagers breathlessly analyze the attack. ""That one is a Kalashnikov bullet. That one is from an AR15,"" says a skinny kid in a baseball cap, pointing at a long silvery shell next to a shorter gold one. Besides them, middle aged couples, old men, and mothers with small infants all gawk at the morbid display. The local press corps huddles together on the sidewalk, checking photos on viewfinders to make sure they have the best images for the police pages. They are relaxed, cheery; this is their daily bread. Thirty minutes after the attack, a battered Ford Focus speeds through the crowd and screeches to a halt against the police tape. The wife of one of the victims jumps out and screams hysterically at the olive-clad soldiers guarding the scene. Her swinging arms are held back by her brother, his eyes red with tears. A few feet away, I grab the shoulder of my cameraman and pull him away to make sure he doesn't get a smack from an angry grieving relative. It is only when I see the pained look on their faces that the loss of human life really sinks in. The screams show the suffering of those who knew the man in his best and worst moments, as a husband at the altar, as a father dancing with his daughter on her 15th birthday, as a lover in the dark of the night. Another day. Another murder. In the Mexican Drug War, such violence has become so common that the slaying of five police at a stop light was a brief tucked in local crime sections. The victims become more numbers for newspaper and government tallies, their human stories and struggling families soon forgotten. These ambush-style killings account for the vast majority of deaths in the conflict. They are known as ""ejecuciones"" or executions. Even the name is chilling; it explains that someone has ordered a death sentence on the target. The gunmen rarely miss. Mexico has no death penalty, but the worst days have seen more than 60 ""executions"" -- two dozen in Ciudad Juarez, more sprinkled over Michoacan, Guerrero, Tamaulipas, Sinaloa, Durango, Tijuana. The next highest number of war victims are people who are kidnapped, murdered and have their bodies dumped. Deaths in shootouts account for a small percentage. This is a war fought by assassins. And their hit-and-run tactics are extremely difficult to defend against. Ioan Grillo's ""El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency,"" published by Bloomsbury Press on November 1. "	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Venezuela Govt, Experts Clash on Results of Security Operation. Venezuela's government has touted the achievements of a militarized security operation that began a year ago, but many experts say it hasn't reduced crime and is in fact generating a greater number of human rights abuses. Venezuela Minister of the Interior, Justice and Peace Gustavo Gonzalez Lopez presented the results of the Operation Liberation of the People (Operacion de Liberacion del Pueblo - OLP) July 13, exactly one year after he announced the creation of the joint police-military operation. Lopez said the OLP has dismantled 157 criminal groups, ""a great number of which are dedicated to paramilitary activity under the structure of organized crime,"" reported El Nacional. He added that a total of 2,399 suspects have been arrested, and 1,492 weapons have been seized during the past year. The OLP ""has significantly mitigated crime rates in the zones and places in which the principal groups operate,"" he said. The minister also said that a recent poll showed 82 percent of Venezuelans approve of the OLP. The government's praise for the OLP runs in sharp contrast to criticism leveled by security experts and observers. Keymer Avila, a professor of criminology at the Central University of Venezuela, said the OLP operations have been ""counterproductive, because they are increasing institutional violence."" According to Avila, 445 people have died as a result of OLP activity. Criminologist Luis Izquiel told El Nacional that the country's militarized approach to citizen security has failed to reduce crime. ""This concept of being prepared for war has not served to diminish criminality, and there is no better evidence than what we are experiencing,"" he said. Concerns about the OLP's negative impact on human rights abuses began immediately and have continued over the course of the past year. At least 17 people were killed during the OLP's initial raids in July 2015. In April of this year, Human Rights Watch published a report documenting several cases of alleged extrajudicial killings by OLP forces. It is somewhat more difficult to pin down the OLP's effect on crime rates. Proponents say the OLP has brought down violence, critics say it hasn't, but it is next to impossible to know for sure since the government routinely withholds data on crime indicators. Venezuela's murky system for reporting on its security situation has even made it difficult for researchers to accurately estimate the number of violent deaths in a given year, one of the few crime statistics that can be counted with a relatively high level of certainty."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Peru Political Leader Headed Violent Land Trafficking Group: Officials. The arrest in Peru of a mayoral delegate and dozens of his suspected accomplices for running a violent land trafficking scheme highlights how decentralizing political power opens more avenues for organized crime on the local level. On June 12, Peruvian authorities arrested 33 alleged members of the ""Injertos de Nuevo Ayacucho,"" a criminal gang that had been in business for over twenty years, reported El Comercio. Authorities believe the group was led by Yhosbel Garcia Buasbek, also known as ""Gordo,"" a special elected mayoral delegate of Nuevo Ayacucho , a town in Canete municipality. The group was dedicated to land trafficking , authorities said. Specifically, they said it invaded private lands in Canete and the neighboring Chincha municipality, forcibly displacing the property owners, then selling the properties to private investors. In order to run his criminal network, Garcia hired a hit squad that took on the name ""Canete exterminators."" Authorities estimated the group killed at least 50 people since 1995, and 8 in 2016 alone. Among the arrested suspects, which by June 14 had reached 37, are four policemen , three active and one retired policeman. ""The urban expansion into the outskirts of cities has given birth to criminal mafias that seek to steal land from others,"" Interior Minister Carlos Basombrio was reported by La Republica as saying. Garcia is not the first Peruvian authority at the municipal level to be linked with crime. In 2014, a study by the Attorney General's Office found that 92 percent of the country's mayors were being investigated for corruption, while at least 345 candidates in the elections scheduled for October that year had been convicted of an illicit activity. But the struggle to break the links between local political representatives and criminal groups is likely to be a slow and difficult process. As InSight Crime has previously noted , the increased decentralization of authority and financial responsibility in Peru and in other parts of the region has given local officials more control over budgets and security policies. This, in turn, has opened the door for more corruption and penetration of organized crime into the local power bases. In Garcia's case, he was said to be working with a construction workers' union and was using his official connections to help him resell his stolen properties."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"US Blacklists Venezuela in Human Trafficking Report. A new report by the U.S. government criticizes Venezuela for failing to enforce existing anti-human trafficking laws. But it's worth noting that poverty and unemployment may be contributing to the problem just as much as weak legislation. The new U.S. State Department report on human trafficking designates Venezuela a Tier 3 country, a status used by the U.S. to identify countries with poor records of fighting trafficking. According to the report, Venezuelans are smuggled abroad, often to work as prostitutes, while foreign nationals are trafficked into the country, often to serve as forced labor in factories, or work in the sex trade. Venezuelan authorities have previously said Chinese-run criminal groups are in the country , shipping in Asian immigrants who are then exploited. Previous U.S. reports have identified Venezuelan trafficking rings that smuggle Brazilian, Colombian, Ecuadorean, Peruvian, and Dominican migrants. The government also fails to do enough to fight sex trafficking within the country, the report says. These cases are harder to spot, as the victims do not cross any international borders and so do not need to show identification. Women are often brought from the poorer interior of the country to work in the sex trade in urban areas such as Caracas, Maracaibo, and Margarita island. One non-governmental organization estimated in 2003 that there were some 40,000 to 50,000 child prostitutes in Venezuela. They are often controlled by organized criminal groups, who manage much of the trafficking in Venezuela, according to the State Department report. The U.S. report criticizes the Venezuelan government for failing to take proper action against trafficking, even though Venezuela has made moves towards strengthening its anti-trafficking legislation. Its 2000 constitution did not specifically ban human trafficking , only the related practices of enslavement or forced prostitution. In 2007, Congress passed a women's rights law, which included provisions to ban the internal trafficking of Venezuelan women. However, as the State Department points out, this does not prohibit the trafficking of men and boys within the country. Each year's report has pointed out this loophole since the law was passed, and this appears to be a mayor reason for Venezuela's status being downgraded. The report also notes that authorities fail to give proper care to victims of trafficking, or to ensure lengthy jail terms for those convicted. But beyond putting legislation in place or arranging after-care for victims, just as important in the fight against trafficking may be the broader issue of providing education and opportunity to Venezuelans. The government has warned that young people are often fooled by traffickers, who promise work or education, such as the chance to study in Europe. Once they have left their homes, they often have no way of paying to return. Improving job or education opportunities for Venezuelans at home would help prevent these kinds of cases. While government statistics show that the proportion of Venezuelans living in poverty more than halved between 1997 and 2009, opposition figures have often pointed to the insufficiency of the minimum wage to purchase basic food supplies. The current minimum wage hovers around 1,400 bolivares , while the value of a basic food basket (which includes items like powdered milk, rice, salt and so on) was just under 1,490 in May 2011, according to the national statistics body INE. Venezuela has rejected the Tier 3 classification by the U.S., calling it ""meddling."" Indeed it is possible, as analyst Adam Isacson has pointed out , that the U.S.'s classifications are influenced by political considerations. The best-ranked country in Latin America is Colombia, which is a firm U.S. ally. Meanwhile Cuba and Venezuela, which have strained relationships with the U.S., are ranked the worst in the hemisphere.

"Gangs Impose Curfew in Honduran Capital. Honduran criminal gangs including the Barrio 18 have reportedly imposed a curfew on residents in certain sectors of the country's capital, illustrating the authorities' failure to provide security. Residents of several neighborhoods in west Tegucigalpa have complained that the Barrio 18 gang, and emerging local gang the Chirizos , are forcing residents to stay off the streets from the early evening, reported La Prensa. ""At 7 p.m. we want to see these businesses closed and the people in their homes,"" stated announcements posted around the area. Stores, transport, and even churches have been forced to shut down early because of the threats, according to reports. Police spokesperson Hector Ivan Mejia said that the police had not received complaints from residents regarding the curfew, though he admitted that this could be because locals were afraid to speak out. Residents said that two police stations formerly located in the area had been closed for years, reported El Heraldo. Barrio 18 is one of the largest street gangs in Latin America, with operations stretching as far as Canada, and often controls operations like extortion, drug dealing, and contract killings in areas under its territory. It is currently reported to be battling the Chirizos for control of extortion rackets in west Tegucigalpa. In Honduras, high government debt has led to a decline in state services, with the authorities even being forced to turn off security cameras in Tegucigalpa in late January because it was unable to pay the company that runs them. Given this situation, the ability of street gangs to control city neighborhoods is not surprising. In 2012, Honduras saw its highest number of homicides on record , with over 7,000 killings. There are many factors behind Honduras' deteriorating security situation, including the presence of gangs like Barrio 18, the country's increasing importance as a transit point in the international drug trade, weak institutions, endemic corruption and lax gun control laws.

New Evidence in Landmark Case Suggests Argentina Judge Ran Drug Ring. A federal judge in Argentina who was once lauded for his anti-narcotic efforts is facing charges that he colluded with drug traffickers and resold confiscated cocaine, in a landmark case that illustrates Argentina's ongoing efforts to combat corruption within its judiciary. Argentine authorities have uncovered evidence that former federal judge Raul Reynoso may have used his office to divert cocaine seized in official operations back to the black market. The theory is backed up by the recent discovery of a document signed by Reynoso in April 2012 and sent to local customs officials, in which the judge authorized two of his employees to use their personal vehicles to transport cocaine that was seized and meant for destruction, La Nacion reported on February 20. Prosecutors allege that the seized cocaine meant for disposal was never destroyed, but rather was sent over the border into Bolivia to be repurchased from the original owners. Reynoso, currently in pretrial incarceration , was charged last year with trafficking more than a metric ton of the drug. The judge is also facing several other charges involving a total of two metric tons of cocaine worth an estimated $12 million, according to La Nacion. These latest revelations add to growing evidence that Reynoso was directly involved in drug trafficking -- despite the fact he was once praised by former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner for his 11-year career in the northern town of Oran on the Bolivian border, a major drug entry point. Since November 2015, authorities have levied a series of increasingly grave charges against Reynoso, beginning with accusations he offered traffickers lenient sentences in exchange for bribes. Several other officials have also been charged in relation to this case. Reynoso, for his part, continues to deny any criminal wrongdoing. The accusation that a central judiciary figure -- who at times handled up to 7,000 drug trafficking cases in one of Argentina's most strategic drug entry points -- not only worked with traffickers but headed a criminal structure of his own speaks to the magnitude of corruption within Argentina's judiciary and the challenges authorities face as they attempt to tackle the issue. Although Reynoso's case stands out as being one of the first in which a federal judge is directly implicated in drug trafficking, it is not an isolated incident. Other Argentine judges and officials from essentially all state institutions involved in anti-narcotic efforts have been accused of facilitating criminal activities or leading trafficking structures of their own. At the same time, Reynoso's case suggests the Argentine government is taking steps to address the problem of judicial corruption. Authorities are soon to release the conclusions of an internal audit of judicial corruption, and recently announced a profound modification of the penal code -- including a measure for mandatory minimum sentencing for certain crimes that would take away some of the judges' sentencing prerogatives. This could potentially clamp down on the use of bribes to secure lenient sentences, as is suspected in Reynoso's case, but the measure is unlikely to significantly reduce drug trafficking could have adverse consequences for human rights. The current administration has also been working on a series of proposals for the past two years to make structural changes to the criminal justice system, including a move toward establishing an accusatorial process for prosecutions. Scholars have argued that such a shift can reduce corruption and improve efficiency by relieving judges from much of the investigative powers they retain under the inquisatorial systems that are prevalent in much of Latin America.	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"MS13, Barrio 18 Rivalry Increasing Violence in Guatemala: President. Guatemala President Otto Perez Molina blamed high levels of violence in January on rivalries between street gangs MS13 and Barrio 18, revealing the impact of these groups not just in El Salvador and Honduras, but Guatemala as well. Violent death statistics rose to 488 in January 2015 from 484 in the same month last year, Prensa Libre reported. Perez said that 40 percent of January's violence was due to conflict between gangs. MS13 and Barrio 18 are Guatemala's most prominent street gangs. Both groups trace their origins back to Los Angeles but now operate mainly in the Northern Triangle of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. In Guatemala the gangs mainly focus on extortion but are also involved in kidnapping and bank robberies, according to the nation's anti-gang unit. January's statistics come despite the president's claimed security achievements during his first three years in office and his promise to make 2015 Guatemala's ""year of non-violence."" Criminal violence claimed 5,924 lives in 2014, a separate Prensa Libre report claimed. As general elections approach this year, Perez is likely hoping to protect the political legacy of his hardline "" mano dura "" security strategies and the election prospects of his conservative Patriot Party. While Perez may be seeking to divert some blame for the increase in violence, the gangs' influence in Guatemala and other Central American countries, is undeniable. Within Guatemala the groups are linked to some 30 percent of the nation's extortion cases. In Honduras MS13 and Barrio 18's violent struggle for the city of San Pedro Sula have contributed to its ranking as the world's murder capital four years in a row. Meanwhile the disintegration of El Salvador's 2012 gang truce was widely considered the primary reason for rising homicide rates there in 2014. The real question is whether these two groups, which have transnational presence, have any kind of centralized, cross-border leadership. While instances of cross-border cooperation have been documented, gang leaders' abilities to coordinate and control actions regionally or even on a national level, are debatable. The gangs may be transnational criminal organizations -- as the US Department of Treasury labeled MS13 in 2012 -- but appear to operate more under a franchise model than as a coherent and structured organization. A new gang truce recently announced in El Salvador may be an opportunity to see how well MS13 and Barrio 18 exercise control over their disparate cliques. It remains to be seen if this truce will be respected throughout El Salvador, let alone in Honduras and Guatemala. Correction: An earlier version of this article reported that Perez said violence increased 40 percent in January. He said that 40 percent of violence in January was due to conflict between gangs."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Chavezs Legacy: An Explosion of Violence and Drug Trafficking. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, whose death from cancer was announced this week, leaves behind a slew of half-started security initiatives, but overall his government proved woefully incapable of tackling violence and organized crime. Since Chavez's election in 1998, the government went through at least 19 separate plans intended to confront crime and violence in Venezuela. Some of these initiatives were well-intentioned: Chavez oversaw the creation of a new police force (National Bolivarian Police - PNB), doubled the salaries received by officers, and established a university meant to train a new generation of well-qualified, educated police. While it has only been deployed in a few select areas so far, there are signs that the new PNB has had some successes in curbing crime, while avoiding the use of deadly force typically associated with Venezuela's police. This shift towards a less militarized, more humanist police training forms an important part of Chavez's legacy on security issues, and is worth applauding. But it took Chavez nine years to get to that point. Prior to a law passed in 2008 , Venezuela had no legislation that standardized police procedures across the country. During the lapse, Venezuela became one of the most dangerous countries in the world. The government is finally starting to confront this fact, albeit with some dubious figures. Just last week, Vice President Nicolas Maduro (now acting president) confirmed that over 16,000 people were killed in 2012, a figure which is about 25 percent lower than the numbers released by the Venezuelan Observatory on Violence (Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia), a respected non-governmental organization. Under Chavez, Venezuela has also implemented several gun control schemes, prohibiting the sale of firearms and destroying tens of thousands of illegal weapons. However, the undeniable reality is that the 14 years of Chavez rule saw a sweeping rise in violence and drug trafficking, and the consolidation of organized criminal networks made up of corrupt elements of security force institutions, such as the National Guard. ""The legacy of Chavez's government is a permanent, constant, systematic, sustained increase of violence year after year,"" Father Alejandro Moreno, an expert on gang violence in Venezuela, told InSight Crime. ""It was a complete disaster."" Perhaps one of the most worrying developments was the increased boldness of the National Guard and military factions involved in trafficking cocaine shipments overseas, a criminal network referred to as the ""Cartel of the Suns"" (Cartel de los Soles). While ties between security and government officials to organized crime was a serious problem long before Chavez's ascent to power, over the past decade the Chavez government repeatedly failed to follow up on reports of military involvement in the drug trade. Allegations by criminal actors such as Walid Makled and disgraced former Supreme Court judge Eladio Aponte only further fed concerns that the very highest levels of the government had been compromised by organized crime and the Cartel of the Suns. Although there have been improvements of late, especially with captures of high level Colombian neo-paramilitary leaders and drug traffickers , tensions with Colombia reached new heights under Chavez, as it became evident that Venezuela had become a major refuge for Colombian guerrilla groups the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) (see InSight Crime's profiles of the FARC 's and ELN 's activities in Venezuela). Some Chavez loyalists argued that cross-border neo-paramilitary organizations -- labeled ""criminal bands,"" or BACRIM, by the Colombian government -- were responsible for much of the violence and drug trafficking along the border states. However, critics have said that the Chavez regime focused security efforts against the BACRIM, while broadly tolerating the guerrilla forces. Both the FARC and other Colombian drug trafficking organizations -- as well as corrupt Venezuelan military and National Guard factions -- helped make Venezuela a major transit country for cocaine shipments going to Central America and Europe. A 2011 report by the country's anti-drug office noted that drug planes travel an extensive network of air routes between Venezuelan border states Apure and Zulia to destinations like the Dominican Republic and Haiti. While authorities touted a record quantity of illicit narcotics seized last year , the numbers only served to underscore the total amount of cocaine believed to travel through the country. Other areas of security and justice reform saw few positive improvements. In a press statement released shortly after Chavez's death was confirmed on the afternoon of March 6, Human Rights Watch lambasted Chavez's assault on judicial independence, which seriously undermined the judiciary's ability to process cases impartially and efficiently. Some judicial reforms proposed by the government only made the court system even more vulnerable to abuses. Neither did the 14-year-Chavez presidency achieve a serious rehaul of Venezuela's prison system, which remains one of the most violent and overcrowded in the world. Venezuela faces some significant uncertainties ahead. Perhaps one of the most damning legacies of the Chavez regime was the creation of a political culture in which loyalty was valued more than competence, and in which the very forces responsible for ensuring citizen security were caught up in wider political battles, compromising their ability to do their job effectively. With elections due to be called 30 days after Chavez's death, prospects for improved security in the near future look grim. ""With no serious policy initiatives or alternatives, it's difficult to see the security situation improving in the short or medium term,"" Venezuela expert and New York University professor Alejandro Velasco told InSight Crime. ""In terms of viable, long term solutions, there is little on the horizon."" Acting President Maduro is currently viewed as Chavez's most likely successor, although there is concern over his ability to deliver on issues like crime. David Smilde of the Washington Office on Latin America told InSight Crime that it was not clear whether Maduro had a real understanding of or commitment to citizen security reform. ""He has been foreign minister for six years and does not have extensive experience with domestic issues. It was a hard sell with Chavez, but some key insiders were able to convince him of the importance of police reform and gun control. It is not clear if they will have to start from scratch with Maduro."" Meanwhile, the country remains stricken by a bitter political divide, which will likely become more acute as election day approaches. The most probable scenario is that the homicide count and criminal activity will continue to inch upwards. Crime loves political chaos."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Brazil Officials Link Rising Sao Paulo Violence to Gang Conflict. Authorities say clashes between rival criminal groups have led to a spike in murders in Brazil's biggest city, but other factors may lie behind the growing violence. Brazilian authorities said a conflict between the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC) and the Brazilian Revolutionary Criminal Command (Comando Revolucionario Brasileiro da Criminalidade - CRBC) led to an increase in homicides in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo in the first three months of 2017, Folha de Sao Paulo reported on May 8. According to the Sao Paulo state Public Security Ministry, a total of 250 murders were registered in the greater Sao Paulo area between January and March 2017, 31.5 percent more than during the same period the year before, when 190 killings were reported. (See InSight Crime's graphic below) Police authorities believe the spike in violence is the result of an offensive ordered by the PCC against the CRBC, which has allegedly been threatening the PCC's influence in Sao Paulo. However, the spike in homicides has not been uniform across the state. While murders in Guarulhos, the state's second-largest city and CRBC's headquarters, have increased by 60.5 percent, in the city of Sao Paulo they actually decreased by 13 percent, dropping from 231 between January and March 2016 to 201 for the same period this year. Rafael Alcadipani, a member of Brazil's Forum for Public Security (Forum Brasileiro de Seguranca Publica), said Sao Paulo proper had been spared the growing violence because the PCC retains control of the city. ""But clashes between rival factions could lead to an increase in homicides in the near future, generating a greater problem for public security,"" Alcadipani said in comments reported by Folha de Sao Paulo. Clashes between the PCC and CRBC may account for part of the rise in homicides in the greater Sao Paulo area, but several other factors are likely compounding the increasing violence. First, the CRBC is a small criminal group by Brazilian standards, with only an estimated 50 to 100 members. Furthermore, Sao Paulo is home to several other criminal organizations, such as the Third Capital Command (Terceiro Comando da Capital - TCC), Seita Satanica, Cerol Fino, and Democratic Freedom Command (Comando Democratico da Liberdade - CDL), among others. ""All of these groups are competing for a share of the drug trade and other illicit income streams like cargo theft,"" Lloyd Belton, an analyst at the consulting firm S-RM, told InSight Crime. These factors make it unlikely that the rising homicide rates are solely the result of the PCC-CRBC conflict. Turf wars between criminal groups in Sao Paulo must be considered in the larger context of gang dynamics in the country. The conflict between the PCC and the group's former allies, the Rio de Janeiro-based Red Command (Comando Vermelho - CV), has shaken up country's criminal landscape. Smaller splinter groups have emerged in Sao Paulo, and might be trying to take advantage of PCC's alleged vulnerability, while the gang is busy fighting the Red Command on various fronts. According to Belton, the PCC's effort to stamp out competitors in Sao Paulo can be read as an attempt ""to consolidate its control and dominance in its traditional stronghold, thereby ending the unofficial ceasefire it had with these groups for the better part of a decade."" Additionally, Brazil is currently suffering from the worst recession in its history. As InSight Crime has previously noted in the case of Rio de Janeiro, the economic downturn may be behind the worsening security conditions in that city. Budget cuts can prevent security forces from receiving the resources and training required to effectively confront criminals, and they are also likely to hamper any efforts to modify existing security strategies. Sao Paulo seems to be suffering from a similar dynamic. Poorly trained security forces and flawed policies contributed to 532 killings by police between January and November 2015 -- a higher figure than the one reported in 2006, when intense clashes between the PCC and security forces left hundreds dead. Moreover, as a recent InSight Crime investigation in Guatemala shows, it can be difficult for authorities to accurately determine the share of total murders committed by crime groups. Thus, statements by Brazilian officials blaming gang conflicts for rising violence should be viewed with some degree of skepticism."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Legend of Colombias Narco-Subs Reaching Europe Becomes Reality. The discovery of a narco-submarine in Spain has raised questions about where and how these vessels are being used, since all previous seizures by Colombia and US authorities in 2019 have been in the Pacific Ocean. On November 24, Spanish authorities seized a 22-meter submarine off the coast of the northern province of Galicia, carrying around three tons of cocaine. Two crew members were reported to be from Ecuador while a third managed to escape. Official sources within the investigation told El Pais that the submarine had come from Colombia but had been built in Guyana and had been ""operating for years."" The investigators added that the drug traffickers had targeted a landing in Galicia because Spain has mostly used its maritime resources to patrol its southern coast. This runs counter to recent trends since all narco-submarines caught in 2019 so far, whether in Colombian or US waters, were found in Pacific waters. The most spectacular capture came in July when a Coast Guard vessel pulled up alongside a narco-sub out at sea, with a crew member jumping onto its roof and pounding on the hatch until it opened. It contained over 10 tons of drugs with a street value of over $300 million. While there have been at least three narco-submarines captured by the US this year, InSight Crime has counted at least 19 more such vessels seized in Colombia, all along its Pacific Coast. Seizures of narco-submarines in Colombia in 2019 and criminal groups operating in these municipalities Prior to the capture of the submarine in Spain, the narrative for the use of these vessels in 2019 seemed quite simple. Graphic courtesy of US Drug Enforcement Administration With cocaine production at an almost record high in Colombia, drug traffickers both needed and could afford to diversify their modes of transportation, risking hundreds of millions of dollars of drugs on one submarine, boat, plane or shipping container. Secondly, the use of submarines was almost exclusive to the Pacific drug trafficking highway as the Caribbean route requires traveling longer distances and further out to open sea. SEE ALSO : Colombia News and Profile The seizures of narco-submarines in Colombia also showed how their use has become almost standard for drug trafficking groups overseeing shipments overseas. All seizures tracked by InSight Crime this year were found either under construction or in use in remote municipalities such as Tumaco , Timbiqui , Buenaventura and Lopez de Micay. The largest seizure ever recorded on a submarine in Colombia came in September when a joint US-Colombia operation netted a vessel carrying eight tons of cocaine off the coast of Tumaco, in the southern department of Narino. While authorities have not been able to assign specific criminal groups to each captured submarine, the Tumaco vessel was reportedly owned by the Oliver Sinisterra Front , an ex-FARC mafia front particularly active in Narino and along the border with Ecuador. This makes the seizure in Spain all the more fascinating. Its size, at 22 meters, is larger than any previously recorded narco-submarine and indicates increased know-how. These have usually measured between 6 and 12 meters although the Tumaco submarine caught in September measured 18.5 meters. Its range is another potential game changer. Narco-submarines leave little room for comfort , dedicating most of their space to cargo, with fuel tanks stashed at the front and often doubling up as sleeping areas, reported Vice. This no-frills approach to cross-Atlantic travel has yielded results and it is highly unlikely that this was the first narco-submarine to reach European shores. According to El Pais, rumors of these subs making it to European and African shores had ""turned into something of a legend among Spanish narcotics officers."" The legend just became a reality."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Money Laundering Crackdown Flounders in Mexico, But Does it Really Matter?Despite a gathering consensus around the idea of making financial ops a key part of Mexico's anti-drug strategy, cracking down on money laundering will never be able to make a real impact on organized crime in the country. A series of articles published by the Los Angeles Times last weekend illustrate how Mexican criminal groups use the global system to move billions of dollars from the U.S. to Mexico on an annual basis, with both governments thus far unable to make much of a dent in the illicit flow of cash. As the Los Angeles Times reports : Even President Felipe Calderon, who sent the army into the streets to chase traffickers after taking office in 2006, an offensive that has seen 43,000 people die since, concedes that Mexico has fallen short in attacking the financial strength of organized crime. ""Without question, we have been at fault,"" Calderon said during a meeting last month with drug-war victims. ""The truth is that the existing structures for detecting money-laundering were simply overwhelmed by reality."" The report also delivers a series of statistics demonstrating the government's failure to crack down on the proceeds of the drug trade. According to the articles' authors, the amount of illicit cash seized by Mexican authorities peaked in 2008 at $71.4 million. The figure dropped to less than $60 million in 2009, $24 million in 2010, and the government is on pace to seize just $12 million this year. Estimates of the amount of cash laundered in Mexico run from roughly $10 billion to $45 billion annually, which suggests that in its best year in recent memory, the government was able to seize, at best, no more than 0.7 percent of all the illicit cash in the country. In light of these statistics, the logical conclusion might be that neither the U.S. nor the Mexican government is doing enough to tamp down on money laundering. However, it's also worth considering another possibility: the figures are so paltry because anti-money laundering (AML) efforts are exceedingly difficult, which makes it unlikely that AML will ever be a significant tool in the fight against organized crime. Therefore, increasing the government resources dedicated to cracking down on dirty money could divert resources away from more fruitful methods of attacking criminal groups. The impediments to tracking illicit money were documented for InSight Crime by Alejandro Hope several weeks ago: the small size of the drug trade relative to the economy as a whole -- Mexico's annual GDP is more than a trillion dollars in nominal terms, and almost $1.6 trillion by purchasing power parity -- makes tracking dirty money akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. Furthermore, the fact that gangsters cannot finance their purchases on credit means that they need to immediately reinvest a high proportion of their revenues to keep themselves in operation. This further reduces the amount of dirty money laundered in the legal economy, and further complicates AML efforts. Another problem is the size of the informal economy. The IMF, for instance, estimates that 30 percent of Mexico's economy is informal, and other Latin American nations have a similarly high rate. Such a huge space for cash-only, virtually untraceable transactions offers a ready sanctuary for gangs looking to hide the proceeds of drug sales. Not coincidentally, one of the more significant criminal trends in recent years is gangs like the Zetas increasingly involving themselves in pirate merchandising. As the LA Times reported, trade between Mexico and the U.S. provides another avenue for gangs looking to pass illicit cash across the border. But with legitimate commerce between the two nations estimated at $400 billion annually, the playing field will always be tilted toward the gangsters who want to move tens of thousands of dollars at a time. Even beyond the operational obstacles to cracking down on criminal revenues, there are conceptual problems. Neither Mexico nor the U.S. government has adequately defined the goal of AML: is it to reduce the amount of revenues, or is it to dismantle existing gangs? If it is merely to reduce the profits, it's worth noting once again the tiny size of the amounts seized thus far. Is the legislation being proposed going to lead to exponentially larger amounts of dirty cash being seized? The seems an unlikely result. This doesn't make stricter AML laws a bad idea, but government officials and analysts alike would do well to temper their enthusiasm and weigh the potential benefits against the costs to the legitimate economy. If the primary goal is to dismantle existing groups, then the question becomes whether AML is successful where other law enforcement tactics -- infiltrating smuggling networks, electronic surveillance, etc. -- fail to bring about a criminal group's demise. While there may be some isolated instances of this dynamic, they are the exception rather than the rule. In any event, no one arguing for stronger AML provisions is making this case. An alternative argument for AML laws is that captured criminals and their families should be prevented from enjoying ill-gotten wealth. This may be valid, but it means that attacking dirty money is essentially an after-the-fact, punitive measure rather than the head of the law enforcement spear. Many analysts point to crackdowns on terrorist financing as evidence of the AML's potential for organized crime, but there is an important difference between the two: money is a terrorist group's means to the end, i.e. launching terrorist attacks. Governments do not worry about terrorist groups having large bank accounts, per se, but rather about them being more able to carry out attacks on civilians. AML efforts reduce the ability of terrorist groups to kill civilians, even if they don't necessarily lead to prosecutions. The dynamic with organized crime groups is fundamentally different. A large bank account is the end in and of itself for a capo like Joaquin Guzman, alias "" El Chapo ."" Therefore, attacking his assets doesn't reduce his ability to harm society the way it does for a terrorist boss. If anything, in fact, it does the opposite; a capo could very well compensate for a marginal reduction in his profits by ramping up production of illegal drugs and flooding the market with more merchandise. Most of the contenders for the 2012 Mexican presidential election -including the overwhelming favorite, Enrique Pena Nieto -- have also paid lip service to the idea that stronger AML efforts are a vital part of the next administration's security strategy. From the standpoint of politics, this makes sense; calling on the government to go after the criminals' financial networks sounds determined and serious. But advocates of AML have made little effort to justify what remains a relatively novel and untested approach. With regard to stopping money laundering, neither the ""how"" nor the ""why"" have been fully answered. "	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Guatemala Ex-Special Forces Arrested Over Mexico Massacre. The governor of Tabasco state, Mexico, announced that a group of Guatemalan former special forces, known as Kaibiles were responsible for the massacre of ten people at an auto repair shop on May 17 in Cardenas. The Kaibiles accused of the killing were among 11 people arrested on Saturday in Tabasco, though the government did not indicate how many of those arrested were former Guatemalan soldiers, reported Excelsior. The group had in their possession a number of assault rifles and a grenade launcher. In apparent retaliation for the arrests, an armed group attacked a state police patrol with grenades and gunfire on Saturday, wounding one police officer and at least one civilian. ""We have men and women arrested who carried weapons for shooting down helicopters and we got them, but that's not enough, they tried to surprise us in San Joaquin [site of the attack on the police] and they think that with that they will terrorize us. Of course not, we are fighting against a faceless army, but there are more of us that seek to live well and work for our people and our family,"" said Governor Andres Granier. Days earlier, the governor had also said that Tabasco was in a state of war with organized crime. Guatemala's Kaibiles have been detected for several years in the ranks of Mexican drug gang the Zetas. Some point to the troops, many of whom have experience in the Guatemalan civil war that ended in 1996, as a factor contributing to the rising brutality in Mexico's drug trade during the administration of Felipe Calderon. The government also said that the massacre in Cardenas was part of an ongoing dispute between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. The two groups, previously allies, have been in a bitter war since early 2010, with the battles raging across Mexico's east coast, and even spilling into Guatemala. "	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Guatemala and the De Facto Legalization of Contraband. Every day, enormous handmade rafts cross the Suchiate river, located in the municipality of Ayutla in Guatemala's San Marcos province, carrying tons of goods from Mexico to Guatemala and vice versa. The Tecun Uman customs office is close to one of the most colorful ""blind spots"" along the border, but few bother with the paperwork required by the Guatemalan trade authority (SAT), waiting for authorization to cross, or paying taxes to move a product from one place to another. The river flows and the clocks tick. Neither ever stops, and nor does the contraband. ""It's true that we are living off contraband, but you have to realize that in this town it's part of the culture, it's the only source of work one can get in Ayutla."" Guadalupe Polanco is 48 years old. She's divided 23 of those years between Mexico and Guatemala, thanks to her job as a ""camarera"" on the Suchiate river. Her job is to row, to beat back the currents, and move products or people (it doesn't make any difference to her) from one country to the other. This story is excerpted from an article that originally appeared in elPeriodico and was translated and reprinted with permission. See original article here. Guadalupe said that fewer people are arriving at the Suchiate because they are intimidated and afraid. What intimidates them? ""The authorities don't allow us to continue working because they say this is a contraband route and that we are working illegally."" Based on observations made during the third week of July, every hour approximately six rafts cross from one riverbank to the other, loaded with products like eggs, milk, cereal, toilet paper, napkins, coffee, beans, rice, and many others. The Guatemalan army said they had detected 20 blind spots along Guatemala's northern frontier with Mexico in February 2012, but in December 2013 that number went up to 65. ""Hardly anything goes from the Guatemalan side to Mexico, only vegetables,"" said one raftsman, who has worked there for over a decade. The majority of those interviewed admitted that they were transporting illegal or contraband goods. Are they afraid of going to prison for this? ""Yes,"" they all answered, but they are more afraid of letting their children go hungry. The smugglers discuss the topic calmly, and they go about their routine as if it were any other job. However, in the government offices and businesses just kilometers from the border, tensions run high when the subject of contraband is brought up. Studies by the Foundation for Development in Guatemala (Fundesa) and the Association of Agriculture, Commerce, Industry, and Finances Committee (CACIF) estimate that contraband could cause up to $755 million in annual losses. This represents roughly 1.6 percent of GDP, and is greater than the budget of each of the three largest sectors in the government: Health ($651 million), the Interior ($564 million) and Defense ($259 million). Nevertheless, the Executive Secretary of the National Commission for the Prevention of Customs and Contraband Fraud (Conacon), Manuel Chocano, calculates that the losses from contraband are no less than $1.6 billion a year. A third opinion from the Finance Ministry calculates that losses from customs fraud range from $780 million to $1 billion each year. Three Wheels, One Job Luis Valladares is a ""triciclero."" He is the next link in the chain of ""contraband ants"", as this activity is known in Suchiate, for, like ants, those involved carry tiny loads from one place to another. When the rafts arrive on the Guatemalan shore, he offers to carry products in his three-wheeled vehicle, a mix between a bicycle and a cart. He moves the products, pedaling away, to the bus terminal, the market, or to whatever small business in Ayutla. He's been doing this for 28 years now. It isn't difficult for Luis to do the calculations, since his mother sold food on the banks of the Suchiate when he was a boy, money which paid for his studies. He graduated at 19, and started working in a bank in Ayutla, where he only earned 1,800 quetzales ($234) per month. The money wasn't enough to live on, so he returned to the river and went back to working as a triciclero. Every day he moves tons of merchandise, pedaling under the unrelenting San Marcos sun. ""I have three children and I need to give them an education. I can offer them that, thank God, through this work, since we charge 10 quetzales (about $1.30) to transport people to the terminal, 5 quetzales (about $0.65) to the park, and sometimes we take tourists around and earn a little more. So thanks to that, we earn some 3,000 or 3,100 quetzales per month (about $390-$400), although there are bad days."" Tax evasion and customs fraud are crimes under Guatemalan law. However, the study ""The Efficiency of Tax Collection through the Courts,"" by the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies (Icefi) found that the criminal prosecution of tax offenses has a effectiveness rate of no more than 10 percent (understood as cases where there is a conviction, or where there is an alternative procedure such as a conditional suspension of prosecution). This means that 90 percent of tax crimes reported to the Public Ministry are never resolved. The same study found that the sums recovered through criminal proceedings come to 2.7 percent of the total sought in all cases. ""A Necessary Evil"" For a large number of people living near the Suchiate, contraband is routine, a source of daily subsistence. But what does the mayor of Ayutla, Erick Zuniga, have to say about these type of activities that are punishable by time in prison under Guatemalan law? ""Contraband has its roots,"" the mayor said. ""We are talking about something that had already been ingrained in our town and our municipality 70 years ago. People inherit these jobs. A camarero or a triciclero earns between $9 and $13 per day. No one is getting rich off this work. As mayor, I am not the right person to interfere with this. I am not going to stop in one year something that has existed for 70."" In addition to presiding over Ayutla for two terms and believing that contraband is a ""culture"" in his town, Zuniga is a man currently facing his own problems. On August 1, 2013, Guatemala's asset seizure court seized eight properties from a frontman for Juan Alberto Ortiz Lopez, alias "" Chamale ,"" who was extradited to the United States in May for allegedly trafficking cocaine to the country since 1998. The court also ordered money laundering investigations against five men who had had dealings with Chamale -- including the mayor of Ayutla. On June 13 of this year, the Public Ministry money laundering office raided Ayulta town hall, looking for information on the municipal taxes paid by five money-changers, who were working on the Suchiate shore changing Mexican pesos for quetzales. They were arrested on December 3, 2013, along with 18 others. According to the investigations, this criminal group has laundered $48 million in Mexico and Guatemala. Among those arrested were Emilio Meono Barrios, a member of the Ayutla local council and treasurer of the municipal football team, and Erika Eugenia Villagran Agustin, the mayor's sister-in-law. The mayor had also installed a tollbooth where tricicleros were forced to pay a 4 cent community tax each time they transported goods. According to Zuniga, the tax was only collected for a few months and the money was used to improve the road, allowing the transporters to travel with greater ease. ""We have never tried to make it easier for them to do their job,"" he said. ""What we have tried to do is offer security to visitors to our municipality, so we have tried to clear up places that are uncomfortable."" Do you believe that the transfer of unregulated goods is a necessary evil? ""For me, yes. As mayor, I am telling you that it is a necessary evil. It won't stop being a necessary evil until they are presented with a better option, until then it will be an evil that feeds many children."" On November 28, 2013, the police stopped an car that was transporting contraband goods. The workers from Suchiate became angry and attacked members of police and army, as well as burning a police car and reclaiming the seized goods. ""The municipality cannot contain the fervor of the people,"" the mayor said when asked about that incident. ""There is no mayor that can stop a town when it is enraged. There are 10,000 people, and I am supposed to put myself in front of them as if I were Superman? They would have destroyed me, I cannot do it."" Are you afraid the authorities will investigate you for failure to report the contraband trade? ""In politics anything could happen. Politics is one of the scariest things, I had never entered such a dark world before. If they bring charges against me, I am ready for whatever follows. I am not consenting to contraband activity, I am simply the mayor of this border town. I am the mayor but I am also an Ayutlan, I am not going to turn against my own people. These are my people and they need a chance. They have no other option."" The Poisoned Fruit Tree Very close to the Suchiate shore is a police patrol car. The officers never leave their vehicle, despite the town's intense heat. They watch for a few minutes before driving on. The river doesn't stop, nor does the merchandise. Hundreds of boxes of goods continue passing from Mexico to Guatemala. Mynor del Cid is also watching and waiting on this shore. He is not interested in the small shipments, he came for the rafts that carry products by the ton. He is a ""fletero."" There's a legal expression known as ""the doctrine of the poisoned fruit tree,"" which establishes that any evidence illegally obtained is inadmissible in court. The illegal evidence is akin to the poisoned fruit. Therefore, if the source of the evidence (the tree) is corrupt, anything else the tree produces will also be corrupt. In Ayutla, the tree appears to be pretty poisoned One day in June 2014, Mynor was driving his vehicle, loaded with goods that had just crossed the Suchiate. He was driving towards an area known in Ayutla as El Alamo ranch, when he was stopped by a police car with the initials ""DINC"" (the police criminal investigation division). ""They pulled me over and were pretty respectful, but the moment they asked for my documents, they grabbed my license and they threw it into their pockets without reading it. They told me that if I had $650 they would let me go on working, and if not they were going to charge me."" Mynor charges between $13 and $39, depending on the weight and destination of the goods. On that unfortunate day he didn't have $650 in his pockets, so he refused to pay. One of the officers pulled out his gun and put it close to Mynor's head. ""I told them to stop extorting me. If you do not pay an extortionist, they kill you, but if you don't pay the police, they put you in jail."" After two hours in custody, Mynor was freed. He admitted that he paid the officers a bribe, although he didn't want to say how much. ""They let me go but I had to give them money,"" Mynor said, while waiting for his contraband products to arrive so he could transport them in his truck. ""This happens frequently to fleteros, police patrols come in from elsewhere and you don't know who is the criminal and who is the authority because they are on the same level."" Return to the River Guadalupe Polanco, Luis Valladares, Mynor del Cid and more than a dozen other raftsmen, tricicleros, fleteros, and money changers who chose not to identify themselves have one thing in common: the contraband trade allows them and their families to eat, and like any other right they are willing to defend it, no matter the cost. ""We'd agree with the government taking away our source of income, so long as they give us another option. But if they only want to take away our means to support our children and leave us unemployed, of course we will not remain silent, we're going to fight for our rights"" So said Guadalupe decisively, perhaps aware that, at more than 65 blind spots located along the Mexico-Guatemala frontier, that is precisely what is happening. * This report was written by Gerson Ortiz for Guatemalan newspaper elPeriodico , as part of the Investigative Reporting Initiative in the Americas , a program run by the International Center for Journalists in partnership with CONNECTAS.

"Colombian Police Arrest One Of Italys Most Wanted Men. A leader of one of Italy's most powerful mafias has been arrested in Colombia's second-largest city, Medellin, indicating the ongoing ties between organized crime groups in the two nations. Domenico Trimboli, a 39-year-old Argentine who allegedly headed Italy's 'Ndrangheta mafia, had been pursued by authorities for three years, reported Italian news agency ANSA. He was one of Europe's 20 most wanted criminals, reported Medellin newspaper El Colombiano , and faces 12 years in prison for drug trafficking offenses once extradited. According to Italian daily La Stampa , Trimboli had lived in Colombia for years with his partner and two children. He was arrested in Medellin's wealthy neighborhood of Laureles. Nicola Gratteri, an Italian prosecutor in the Calabria region from which the 'Ndrangheta hails, said Trimboli ""had a lot of money and this facilitated his peaceful stay in Colombia and his ability to do big business."" 'Ndrangheta is Italy's richest and powerful mafia, with annual profits estimated to equal around 3 percent of Italy's GDP, due to its control over the European cocaine trade, said ANSA. Links between 'Ndrangheta and Colombian drug traffickers are believed to go back more than a decade. The Italian group began buying cocaine directly from Latin America in the 1990s and set up a local network in Colombia, according to Italian prosecutor and 'Ndragheta expert Enzo Macri, interviewed for a 2006 Guardian feature on the group. The US Drugs Enforcement Administration (DEA) has records of 'Ndrangheta leader Santo Sciopone residing in Colombia since 2000, reported El Colombiano. Relations between 'Ndrangheta and Latin American drug traffickers are ""excellent,"" a leader of the Italian group told German newspaper Speigel last year, with the ""brotherhood"" ensuring good prices and quality, and efficiency along the shipping chain. Nicola Gratteri, who has specialized in tracking the 'Ndrangheta's growth, told the Guardian 80 percent of cocaine entering Europe was brought in by the group, which had more than 10,000 members in different countries. According to Macri, the syndicate ""represents the globalization of Italian organised crime."""	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Why Does Guatemalas President Want to Expel Head of Anti-Graft Body?A battle seems to be brewing over the future of Guatemala's United Nations backed anti-corruption body, the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG). Guatemalan news outlet Nomada reports the country's president is heading to New York where he plans to ask for the ouster of the head of the anti-graft commission, as investigators are reportedly beginning to dig into shady spots in the president's campaign finance record. Guatemala Attorney General Thelma Aldana has threatened to resign if President Jimmy Morales calls on United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres to remove Ivan Velasquez as head of the CICIG. But what would lead the weakest president in democratic history to such political suicide? Nomada spoke to four high-level sources to find out. The four sources are at the ministerial level, in the Attorney General's Office (Ministerio Publico - MP) and in the diplomatic corps. Faced with the delicate situation of an apparent political crisis in the making, they agreed to speak under the condition of anonymity. *This article originally appeared in Nomada and has been translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission. Its views do not necessarily reflect those of InSight Crime. See Spanish original here. With excellent connections in Washington, the president of the media outlet elPeriodico Jose Ruben Zamora was the first to warn of the crisis on social media. And even though nobody in the presidency officially responded, sources confirmed that the ""secret"" meeting President Jimmy Morales had asked for with the UN secretary general, Ivan Velasquez's only boss, was to seek a change in command in the CICIG. This time, the president's preoccupation wasn't about the case against his son and brother for defrauding the country's National Property Registry (Registro General de la Propiedad - RGP). Nor was it to defend his closest circle of advisors being investigated by the MP. It's something much more serious. Two of the sources confirmed that Morales had discovered that the CICIG and the MP have spent weeks investigating his campaign financing activities from the second round of the 2015 election, and that those investigations could potentially target the president. With the revelation in June 2016 of the ""cooptation of the state"" case against the administration of former President Otto Perez Molina and Roxana Baldetti, the CICIG and the MP unraveled a network of sophisticated structures of channels, banks, mines, gas stations, telephone companies and construction companies used to illegally fund candidates and then collect favors in state contracts. And now, Nomada's sources confirm, the MP and CICIG are investigating the finances of then-presidential candidate Jimmy Morales and his party. Three of the sources say they were related to the cooptation case and other corruption probes. Confirmado: Thelma Aldana amenaza con renunciar si Jimmy Morales pide el retiro de Ivan Velasquez como jefe de la CICIG. -- nomada (nomadagt) 23 de agosto de 2017 (This tweet from Nomada reads, ""Confirmed: Thelma Aldana threatens to resign if Jimmy Morales asks for the retirement of Ivan Velasquez as head of CICIG."") ""The president is very nervous and thought that expelling Ivan Velasquez would be the easiest option to save himself,"" another source added. The political moment recalls the months between December 2014 and April 2015, when then-President Otto Perez Molina hesitated to support the CICIG, which came closer to the presidential office with each investigation, eventually leading to his resignation and arrest. In the last months of 2014, the CICIG had reached Perez Molina's inner circle. The body accused former congressional president Gudy Rivera, now serving a 13-year sentence, of manipulating justice. And it came to light that the late Byron Lima had taken control of prisons during the administration of then-Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla, who today stands accused in a corruption case and whose extradition the United States has requested on drug trafficking charges. On April 14, 2015, two days before the CICIG and MP exposed the customs fraud case dubbed La Linea, Perez Molina made this statement on radio when he refused to renew the mandate of the CICIG, already headed by Ivan Velasquez. ""Some want to pressure me into saying that the president is afraid to follow CICIG because they will investigate him. The CICIG does not come here to investigate presidents,"" Perez Molina said. Ten days later he renewed the CICIG's mandate. And four and a half months after that statement, Thelma Aldana ordered his arrest. Another source closed the interview for this report with this reflection: ""The dilemma of the president and some of the businessmen who illegally financed [Morales'] campaign is that they do not know if anyone has already told the authorities the method they used to circumvent the law. Given this uncertainty, until yesterday, [Morales] had chosen to try to expel Ivan Velasquez. We will have to see what happens in the coming days, weeks and months,"" one of the sources added. * This article originally appeared in Nomada and has been translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission.

"Puerto Rico to Deploy National Guard to Fight Drug Trafficking. Puerto Rico's newly-inaugurated governor has announced the deployment of the National Guard along the island's coastline, as the US territory struggles to combat rising drug-related crime. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla told EFE the military would help police monitor seaports and airports ""with the aim of preventing the entry of drugs and illegal weapons into the country."" When and where exactly the plan will be implemented remains unknown, reported national newspaper Claridad , as to reveal such details would ""help the drug traffickers and criminals that we want to fight,"" said Padilla. The decision was supported by Puerto Rico's attorney general's office, and law enforcement agencies, which see the security situation deteriorating on the island, even though murders appeared to decline slightly during 2012. The murder rate remains around 26 per 100,000, five times the rate on the US mainland. Puerto Rico has become an increasingly important location in the transport of drugs from South America through the Caribbean, reflected in a 30 per cent rise in cocaine seizures on the island from 2009 to 2010. Its status as a US territory means a lack of customs inspections on shipments bound for the United States - and corruption within the police adds to the island's appeal for drug traffickers. Its growing importance as a drug transit nation has been blamed for a concurrent rise in violent crime. Before his election Padilla called for a state of emergency to be imposed in light of almost 500 murders having taken place on the island in the first six months of 2012. The previous year was the most violent in the US territory's history, with 1,136 murders recorded. Three quarters of the killings were on the streets and 90 percent were shootings."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Attack in Honduras Bajo Aguan Region Leaves 4 Dead. Four peasant farmers were killed and eleven wounded in an ambush in the Bajo Aguan region in northeastern Honduras, highlighting escalating violence in that area which top officials connect, in part, to organized crime and drug smuggling. As the Associated Press reports , the victims of the March 28 attack were members of the Unified Peasant Movement of Aguan (MUCA). Eleven other MUCA members were wounded, according to the group's leaders. MUCA's vice president, Juan Chinchilla, said the farmers were leaving from work in various vehicles when they were ambushed by a group of gunmen without any chance to flee or defend themselves. Bajo Aguan has been the site of a violent land conflict for over two years involving a multitude of violent actors. The region borders part of the northeastern province of Colon, an important transit point for transnational drug shipments moving north. Thursday's attack occurred on the outskirts of the municipality of Trujillo, Colon, not far from where a military convoy was ambushed on March 26. That ambush was allegedly carried out by a group dressed as peasant farmers carrying automatic assault weapons. Descriptions of the assailants from Thursday's attack on MUCA's members match those of the gunmen who attacked the convoy on Monday. President Porfirio Lobo stated this week that it has become clear that criminal groups active in drug trafficking are responsible for the recent bloodshed in Bajo Aguan. And he has deployed the military in recent months to tighten security in the zone. However, there are also concerns that security forces themselves may be connected to other assaults on peasant farmers in the region. This month 94 members of the US Congress signed a letter calling on the Obama administration to suspend all military and police aid to Honduras until human rights violations in the region are addressed. Seven US senators signed an additional letter requesting that the State Department update them on Honduran investigations of human rights abuses in order for them to monitor progress. For its part, the Honduran Congress attempted to quell conflict by passing decrees in June and September 2011 which permitted peasants to purchase over 4,000 hectares of land. However, both of these plans fell through as the result of outbreaks of hostility in the region. 	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Guatemala, Honduras Presidents Blame US, Ignore Own Problems. Presidents in Central America have blamed US drug policy for fueling the ongoing child migrant crisis, but the violence, unemployment and underdevelopment fueling this flight has more to do with the way the elites run these countries than US actions. Children have fled in massive numbers. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) says close to 63,000 unaccompanied minors have been picked up at the US-Mexico border during FY2014 , a 100 percent increase over the previous fiscal year. What is pushing this migration is a complex set of circumstances that includes gang violence at home , but in public statements made prior to meeting with US President Barack Obama in late July to discuss this issue, both Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina pointed towards US counterdrug policy and US drug consumption as the driving forces. ""A good part of (migration) has to do with the lack of opportunities in Central America, which has its origin in the climate of violence, and this violence, almost 85 percent of it, is related to the issue of drug trafficking,"" Hernandez said, according to Reuters. Things had gotten worse in Honduras, Hernandez added, because anti-drug operations in the US, Colombia and Mexico had pushed more trafficking to his small country. Perez Molina was more direct: ""Once again countries of Central America became transit corridors or warehouses for the drugs reaching the United States,"" he said, according to ABC News. The US does share some of the blame for this crisis. In particular, the country failed to create or share adequate databases of the massive number of ex-convicts it deported beginning in the late 1990s , which helped feed the growth of the gangs who are at the heart of the violence pushing Central American children north. And the US could certainly do more to address the current situation, although requests by Honduras for a "" mini Marshall Plan "" for Central America presume a level of professionalism on the part of public officials in the region that simply does not exist. What's more, Guatemala and Honduras would have been ideal places for these street gangs to take root even if US deportation policies had not been a contributing factor. And they provided excellent conditions for drug trafficking organizations to flourish regardless of the strategies implemented in Colombia, Mexico and the United States. To begin with, Guatemala and Honduras are some of the most corrupt countries on the planet. Guatemala ranks 123 on the latest Transparency International corruption index , just ahead of countries such as Azerbaijan and Gambia; Honduras ranks 140, behind countries such as Bangladesh and Guyana. Corruption permeates these societies. In one of the few cases to actually reach a formal investigation stage in Honduras, the government is accusing Mario Zelaya, the former head of the country's social security institute, of embezzling over 200 million dollars from the body. Zelaya is on the run in Honduras , where authorities seem unable to capture him. Poor financing of key institutions is an important factor in this corruption. According to the World Bank , Guatemala collects just 10.8 percent of its GDP in taxes and Honduras just 14.7 percent of its GDP in taxes, putting the two among the lowest tax paying countries in the world (see chart below developed using World Bank statistics). One of the many sectors that is hardest hit by this lack of tax collection is the police. In both Guatemala and Honduras, the perennial question with regards to security in the communities wracked by gang violence is how to recruit, train, equip and pay police better. In Honduras, police very often do not have paper on which to print their reports -- they often borrow it from the also impoverished Attorney General's Office -- and they sometimes have to ask victims of crimes to pay for their gasoline to investigate a case. In Guatemala, poorly paid police routinely form part of groups that steal and resell illegal drugs. In both countries, police officials collect ""ghost"" salaries in order to augment their earnings. Meanwhile, both governments take extreme measures to open avenues for ""investment"" that often foments the criminal environment. Under a so-called "" Law to Incentivize Tourism "" following Hurricane Mitch in 1998, for instance, fast food restaurants do not have to pay taxes in the first 10 years they operate in Honduras. The result has been a massive influx of US fast food chains, which are simultaneously making the country more obese ( one local pediatrician called it a ""pandemic"" ), putting local restaurants out of business and augmenting unemployment. Over the years such policies have made these countries hugely dependent on foreign aid and foreign-earned income -- mostly remittances, but also drug trafficking profits. A few years ago in Coban, Guatemala, cardamom farmers complained because they were receiving so many payments in dollars, they had to make an extra trip into town to exchange them. The cardamom market is one of various used to launder drug proceeds. The criminal environment is also compounded by the elites' penchant for using -- and their ability to use -- the justice system only when it works in their interests. For years, hydroelectric and mining interests in Guatemala have been pushing to legalize ever-larger land holdings to secure their investments. When the indigenous groups most impacted by these economic projects push back, the indigenous are extracted by security forces, and their cases languish and get thrown out of the courts. The latest clashes in the Alta Verapaz province over the construction of a hydroelectric service left three protestors dead; in response the community took eight police captive (they have since been released). Any government official who supports indigenous land rights or goes against this elite in virtually any fashion can expect to have their public service career cut short. Witness the recent ousting of Claudia Paz y Paz , Guatemala's celebrated former Attorney General , who lowered impunity rates, imprisoned some of the most feared drug traffickers in the country, and created a more effective justice system for battered women. But after trying and convicting a former general for genocide (whose conviction was overturned a week later) and daring to legally defend indigenous groups resisting large economic projects, Paz y Paz was prematurely pushed out of office. All told, it is disingenuous for the presidents of Honduras and Guatemala to point the finger at the United States. Children are fleeing these countries largely due to extreme violence and a lack of opportunity. While US policy may have played a role, both of those factors are in large part the result of decades of political and economic policies that have systematically impoverished the two nations, while enriching a small elite."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Nicaraguas Anti-Money Laundering Unit Tainted by Politics. Controversy over the Nicaragua's appointment of an army general to head a new anti-money laundering unit reveals the difficulty of disentangling the fight against organized crime from politics in this Central American nation. President Daniel Ortega named Major General Denis Membreno Rivas to head the new Financial Analysis Unit (UAF). Membreno has served as the army's inspector general and as head of its intelligence agency. His deputy will be police Chief Commissioner Aldo Martin Saenz Ulloa, reported Confidencial. The government passed the law creating the Financial Analysis Unit in June. Its mission is to prevent the laundering of profits from crime or terrorism, and it will have the power to demand information on ""suspicious transactions,"" defined as those involving the transfer of $10,000 or more. Jose Adan Aguerri, head of business association Cosep , expressed concern that the unit's leaders were not specialists in finance, insisting that they lacked the experience to lead the body. However, he said that it was good that at least the men were not drawn directly from the ruling FSLN party, reported La Prensa. The controversy over the establishment of the anti-money laundering unit is an example of how, as with many things in Nicaragua, the fight against organized crime is hard to disentangle from politics. The business sector, government critics and civil society groups have opposed the creation of the UAF, saying that the government will use it to harass its opponents and invade citizens' privacy. Opposition parties have warned that the unit, which will be under the direct command of the executive, could be used as a "" political weapon "" by the Ortega government. However, it is important to establish this kind of institution to complement the interdiction work Nicaragua is carrying out. Last weekend the Nicaraguan navy intercepted a boat carrying a ton of cocaine off the coast of the North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN). A recent InSight Crime investigation examined the Nicaraguan criminal networks that have been set up to traffic cocaine through the RAAN and neighboring South Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAS), driving up murder rates and in some areas substituting for the state. The government needs all the tools it can to fight the growing problem Nicaragua faces as a transit nation for drugs."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0

The governments of Mexico, the United States and Central America agreed to share information from their databases in order to improve cooperation against organized crime. Janet Napolitano, secretary of homeland security, and other U.S. officials met with representatives of Central American nations in Washington D.C. to discuss security issues. The talks also focused on aviation security and tackling corruption within law enforcement, customs and border security agencies, according to reports.

"Panamas Record Drug Seizures Reflect Colombias Cocaine Boom. Authorities in Panama say they have seized more drugs in 2016 than in any other year since 2000, and soaring cocaine production in neighboring Colombia may be the most likely explanation behind this rise. As of December 13, authorities had intercepted 62.3 metric tons of cocaine and marijuana -- 7 percent more than last year's total and nearly 60 percent more than in 2014. It also represents the highest annual drug seizure figure since the turn of the century, the Public Security Ministry announced. (See graph below) Cocaine made up the vast majority -- nearly 90 percent -- of the seized drugs in 2016, at 55.5 metric tons. ""This was made possible throughmore efficient operations, better teams and due to the strategies that we have established in the fight against drug trafficking,"" Public Security Minister Alexis Bethancourt said. The minister praised the results of Operation Shield that ran from May to June 2016, when authorities seized 3 metric tons of cocaine and arrested 300 people suspected of ties to drug trafficking. He also applauded Operation Homeland, a one-month operation carried out at the end of 2015 which saw the seizure of $1.8 million in cash, and numerous arrests and drug interdictions. As is often the case with drug seizures, Panama's record figures could be the result of a variety of dynamics. While stepped-up efforts by the security forces may be part of the answer, it's likely that higher seizures are also the product of an increase in cocaine passing through the country. Colombia is the world's largest cocaine producer , and Panama has historically been its gateway for drugs heading up to the United States. According to the US State Department's most recent estimates , up to 90 percent of all cocaine entering the country passes through the Central American corridor. Given its geographic location, Panama is bound to be affected by Colombia's ongoing explosion in coca crops. Cultivation have soared to double the 2013 levels, and this has been accompanied by record cocaine seizures in the Andean country. What's more, officials from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) recently told InSight Crime that there are indications that Colombian criminal groups known as ""BACRIM"" -- which are largely responsible for the country's transnational drug trafficking -- have been increasing their presence on the Panamanian border over the past year. The home base of Colombia's most powerful BACRIM, the Urabenos, is right along this border region, and the group has long used the Caribbean coast as a departure point for illegal drugs. Despite a large-scale police operation against the Urabenos, a number of huge seizures linked to the group prove that they still have an impressive operational capacity on the drug trafficking front. Panama's changing security strategy could also be partly responsible for the record seizures. President Juan Carlos Varela has responded to rising production in Colombia by announcing that interdiction efforts would be bolstered, and the government has allocated funds to set up a new Special Anti-Narcotics Unit ."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Massive Bust Shows Italian Mafia Role in LatAm Drug Trade. Colombian, Italian and US authorities collaborated in a massive round-up of nearly 150 suspected members of a multicontinental drug trafficking ring, highlighting the deep links between Italian criminal organizations and Latin America's drug trade. The operation saw the arrests of 144 suspects who were allegedly operating in Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Chile, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Italy, according to La Repubblica , which also reported that authorities seized 11 tons of cocaine estimated to be worth some $3.3 billion. The trafficking ring was allegedly headed by brothers Franco and Giuseppe Cosimo Monteleone, suspected members of the powerful 'Ndrangheta crime organization based in the Calabria region of Italy. The arrests also targeted suspects allegedly belonging to the Colombian rebel group known as the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN), as well as Colombia criminal groups known as bandas criminales, or BACRIM. According to La Repubblica, the ELN provided security for drug labs and smuggling routes that carried the cocaine to BACRIM-controlled departure points, where it was loaded onto "" go-fast boats "" or commercial shipping vessels that trafficked the drugs to countries in the Caribbean and Central America for further shipment to Europe and the United States. Reuters reported that some of the contraband was hidden in shipments of tropical fruit. The bust, dubbed ""Operation Two Seas,"" comes just days after Italian police captured one of that country's most wanted fugitives, a suspected leading figure of 'Ndrangheta named Ernesto Fazzalari, who had been on the run since 1996. Operation Two Seas underscores the extent to which the 'Ndrangheta have made inroads in Latin America since the 1990s, when the group began importing Colombian cocaine to Europe. The presence of suspected 'Ndrangheta members has previously been detected in many of the Latin American countries named above, as well as in other countries in the region like Argentina. Cultural and linguistic similarities, as well as strong trade and migration ties between Italy and many Latin American countries have likely contributed to the expansion of 'Ndrangheta operations in the region in recent years. According to some estimates , the group controls up to 80 percent of Europe's cocaine traffic. The recent bust is not the first of its kind, and it is unlikely to be the last. In June and October 2015, Italian and Latin American authorities mounted similar collaborative operations targeting 'Ndrangheta networks in the Americas, including one focusing on a cocaine trafficking ring with a presence in Costa Rica and New York City. Given the 'Ndrangheta's geographic reach, financial power and criminal sophistication ( pdf ), this type of cooperation will be necessary for authorities as they continue efforts to disrupt the activities of the group and its affiliates going forward."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Honduras Security Surge May Lower Crime Rates in Unexpected Way. Honduras' president claims that a recent security surge has reduced violent crime, but human rights officials argue that any reduction is due to the fact that corrupt police have been busy with the operation, and thus unable to commit crimes themselves. President Porfirio Lobo announced that Operation Lightning , which deployed joint police-military patrols in two of Honduras' largest cities, has lowered the rate of violence by 90 percent in Tegucigalpa and 50 percent in San Pedro Sula. Honduras currently has one of the highest murder rates in the world, according to figures quoted by the National Commission for Human Rights (CONADEH) The president blames rivalries between criminal gangs for the increase in violence in Honduras, where there are approximately 20 murders per day ; however, the country's human rights commissioner, Ramon Custodio, has criticized the president for politicizing the issue of public security. Custodio believes that Operation Lightning has had little effect on crime rates and says that any decrease in violence since implementation of the security plan is largely due to the fact that the country's notoriously corrupt police forces have been occupied with security patrols , and so have not been committing crimes themselves. 	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"1,230 Bodies Found in Mexicos Narco-Graves Since 2007. The number of bodies dug up from hidden graves in Mexico has been rising steadily over the past four years, according to the country's main human rights watchdog group, with a total of 1,230 found since 2007 -- over 60 percent of them this year. According to data from Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH), a quasi-governmental institution charged with evaluating the state's adherence to human rights law, the bodies have been distributed in 310 graves across the country. The commission's data shows that the trend is increasing at an alarming rate. From January 2007 to December 2009, the CNDH counted only 123 victims buried in hidden graves, but since then organization has counted 1,107 (90 percent of the total). So far this year 768 bodies have been discovered, making up some 63 percent of the total. In general the states where these clandestine graves are found are home to the most drug-related violence, leading to the sites being referred to as ""narco-graves."" The largest burial sites have been found in Tamaulipas, Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon, Durango, Guerrero, Morelos, Coahuila, Veracruz, Michoacan and Oaxaca. Perhaps the most famous ""narco-grave"" discovery took place in August 2010, when officials found the bodies of 72 Central American migrants buried in a series of graves in San Fernando, Tamaulipas. As InSight Crime has reported , organized crime has a tightening grip on the migrant smuggling business, meaning that migrants are especially vulnerable to drug violence. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Reports of Kidnapping in Venezuela Nearly Double in 2016. The number of recorded kidnappings in Venezuela has increased by 88 percent over the last year, according to new figures, which help to quantify a security crisis that has all too often been obscured by the government's reluctance to release damning crime statistics. There were 411 reported kidnappings in Venezuela between January and the second week of September 2016, compared to 219 over the same period in 2015, according to police figures obtained by Runrunes. (See Runrunes graphic below) Of these victims, 375 were liberated in 2016, compared to 208 in 2015, while 18 were killed, compared to nine in 2015. While kidnappings have been rising, the police's ability to resolve them has been falling. According to Runrunes, internal police reports show that 82 percent of reported cases last year ended with the freeing of the hostage without a ransom being paid, but in 2016 this has dropped to 62 percent. Over 80 percent of the kidnappings were concentrated in just two zones: the state of Miranda, where 216 incidents were reported, and the Capital District of Caracas, where 123 kidnappings were recorded. Evidence that kidnapping is out of control in Venezuela has been emerging for some years. However, the figures obtained by Runrunes demonstrate this with a clarity previously lacking due to the Venezuelan government's reluctance to publish regular and reliable statistics that illustrate the country's security crisis. As noted by Runrunes, the statistics are likely a huge underestimate, as many victims, perhaps even a majority, prefer to negotiate with the kidnappers rather than report to the police. In addition, it does not account for the plague of ""express kidnappings,"" where victims are held for under 48 hours while their accounts are cleaned out or a quick ransom is paid. The figures also highlight that while kidnapping may be rampant in Venezuela, it is also highly concentrated. Of particular note is the state of Miranda, which accounts for over half of all cases nationwide. Miranda is the site of many of the country's designated areas popularly known as ""peace zones"" -- an unofficial state initiative where security forces essentially withdraw from certain areas. In many cases, the vacuum left by the state is filled by criminals, and many peace zones have become strongholds for gangs and violence hotspots. A security forces report seen by InSight Crime highlights the importance of these zones for kidnapping gangs in Miranda and Caracas, stating ""the 'peace zones' are used by kidnappers as 'captivity zones.'"" Earlier this week, the Venezuelan government announced a new national strategy to combat kidnapping. However, the government's poor track record on implementing new security initiatives suggests the kidnapping epidemic is unlikely to end for the foreseeable future."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Abduction of Chapos Son May Signal War Between Mexico Cartels. A group of men that included a son of El Chapo Guzman were abducted at gunpoint from an upscale restaurant in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, in what appears to be a high-level attack in the war between two of the country's most powerful drug cartels. According to the Attorney General's Office in the state of Jalisco, where Puerto Vallarta is located, six men were kidnapped on the evening of August 15 from a local gourmet restaurant called La Leche. However, the exact number of victims remains unclear; the same office previously said between 10 and 12 had been kidnapped and some local media outlets were reporting 16 victims. Police sources told InSight Crime that authorities are actively investigating leads that the kidnapping is related to the ongoing battle between the powerful Sinaloa Cartel and the dominant criminal organization in that area, the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation ( CJNG ). Initial reports suggest that CJNG operatives kidnapped high-ranking members of the Sinaloa Cartel while they were celebrating a night out. When police arrived at the scene of the crime, they reportedly found abandoned luxury vehicles containing expensive liquor and other accessories. Jalisco Attorney General Eduardo Almaguer confirmed that Alfredo Guzman, the son of jailed Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, was among the victims of the abduction. Almaguer had earlier said it was another son, Ivan Archivaldo Guzman, that was taken. According to Almaguer, the relatives of the victims have not made official reports that the men are missing, which has complicated efforts to determine their identities. In addition to local authorities, the Mexican Army, Navy and Federal Police are all reportedly participating in the search for the missing men. As of this writing, their fate remains unclear. The attack at La Leche restaurant appears to be the latest and perhaps the most dramatic flare-up in a simmering war between CJNG and the Sinaloa Cartel. Indications of conflict between the two groups began to surface last year, following reports of disputes over important drug trafficking routes. In February, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that CJNG appeared to have launched an offensive against the Sinaloa Cartel to seize control of Tijuana, a key drug trafficking corridor on the US border. In March, local media reported on an ongoing conflict between the two groups in the state of Colima, home to the strategically important port of Manzanillo. Although the conflict between CJNG and the Sinaloa Cartel pre-dates El Chapo's January 2016 arrest , it is possible that the kingpin's capture has emboldened his rivals to attempt to move in on territory under his organization's control. For example, a group of gunmen reportedly affiliated with another of the Sinaloa Cartel's rivals, the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO), mounted an attack in June in El Chapo's hometown that saw his mother's home ransacked and several bystanders killed."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Colombia Capo May Be First Ever Extradited to United States, Twice. A former member of Colombia's Norte del Valle Cartel was the first Colombian to be extradited to face charges in the United States on two different occasions, a cautionary tale regarding the low sentences often handed to capos in the United States. Jose Sanchez Cristancho, alias ""El hombre del overol"" (""the Overall Man""), was extradited on February 28. He had already been imprisoned in the United States between 2001 and 2006, and had spent another three years on probation. It did not last, as the US government charged that in 2014 he allegedly participated in a $1 million bank fraud, El Espectador reported. Sanchez Cristancho then became a fugitive in Colombia, where he allegedly resumed his criminal activities, until his arrest in Bogota in March 2017. His extradition to the United States was approved in October 2017. The Overall Man was one of the leaders of the Norte del Valle Cartel under the command of Orlando Henao Montoya, who also used the same pseudonym in an effort to deceive authorities and make them believe that Sanchez Cristancho was the leader of the organization. Sanchez Cristancho may be the first Colombian capo extradited to the United States on two separate instances, but he is not the first crime boss to resume his criminal activities after having regained his freedom. The case of Victor Patino, alias ""El Quimico,"" and that of Carlos Jose Robayo, alias ""Guacamayo,"" both of whom were also former members of the Norte del Valle Cartel who returned to Colombia to reclaim their properties, launched a bloody confrontation with a rival group the Rastrojos in the process. Professor and criminal ethnographer David Martinez Amador believes that unlike the great Mexican or Colombian drug traffickers, it is relatively easy for drug traffickers to return to the criminal world after serving short sentences in the United States. ""If we talk about the big Colombian or Mexican capos,"" Martinez Amador told InSight Crime, ""The sentences are draconian and, although they do not stipulate life in prison in all cases, the capos return at an age where it is more difficult to return to the organization and compete with new leadership."" However, relatively short sentences such as that against Sanchez Cristancho generate rational incentives to return to the criminal world. ""The contacts are still valid, and there are spaces available. It is illogical to think that all of these individuals tend to commit themselves to not reoffend,"" Martinez Amador said."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Report Indicates Widespread Police Corruption in Tijuana. Allegations collected from detained drug traffickers and local authorities reveal widespread police corruption in Tijuana, investigative newspaper Zeta reports, adding to the list of troubling security developments in Mexico's northern border city. Following their arrests in May 2015, brothers Manuel Rafael and Roberto Carlos Toscano Rodriguez alleged a state police chief told them ""El Pablito,"" a supposed drug trafficker, was in charge and that the group ""La Barredora"" was tasked with doing his bidding, reported Tijuana-based newspaper Zeta. The brothers claimed La Barredora was comprised of members of the state and municipal police forces, according to Zeta. On February 6 of this year, a threatening note signed by La Barredora was found next to the body of an unidentified youth. According to Zeta, since early 2015 these types of messages signed by La Barredora have appeared regularly in northern Tijuana, where a violent turf war has played out between rival criminal groups. Local authorities also told Zeta that municipal officers from at least three police delegations have been found ""giving courtesies and receiving money from criminals"" on behalf of their superiors. In an interview with Zeta, Francisco Vega de Lamadrid, governor of Baja California, said prosecutors are investigating the November 2015 murder of a municipal police officer who is suspected of being involved in a drug theft reportedly carried out by Tijuana security forces. If these allegations are true, they indicate corruption is deeply embedded within the municipal and state police forces in Tijuana. Unfortunately, police corruption is only one part of a larger framework that points to steadily worsening security conditions in the northern border city. Although violence has gone down in many parts of northern Mexico in recent years, the opposite is true in Tijuana. In 2012 the city registered a murder rate of 28 per 100,000 residents, a lower rate than some US cities at the time. But Tijuana's homicide rate hovered in the low 30s for the next two years before climbing to 39 per 100,000 last year, even as other northern cities experienced huge security gains. Ciudad Juarez, for example, was the murder capital of the world in 2010, but did not even rank among the 50 most dangerous cities last year, according to one Mexican non-governmental organization. Possible changes in Tijuana's criminal dynamics are further cause for concern. Tijuana's underworld is believed to be controlled by the Sinaloa Cartel, but the recent discovery of a narco-tunnel reportedly operated by the notoriously violent Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG) suggests a conflict could be brewing over the city's valuable trafficking routes into the United States."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Drug Trafficking Conviction Underlines US Border Corruption. A US Border Patrol agent has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for providing information that helped traffickers move drugs into the United States from Mexico, in a case which underscores the growing problem of corruption among US border officials. While working as an undercover Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agent based in Yuma, Arizona, Ivhan Herrera-Chiang provided information to an Arizona prison officer, which was subsequently passed on to smugglers bringing drugs across the frontier from Mexico. Herrera-Chiang provided maps of hidden underground sensors, lock combinations to gates along the border and the location of CBP traffic checkpoints, as well as a detailed description of a CBP informant in Mexico who was almost assassinated, reported AZ Central. Herrera-Chiang -- who was originally arrested and pleaded guilty in 2012 -- claimed he did not know the information was being used to aid drug trafficking and that he received less than $5,000 for the intelligence, although the prison officer -- who was imprisoned for 9 years in 2012 -- claimed Herrera-Chiang received up to $60,000, according to AZ Central. The training and anti-corruption procedures in place for US border patrol agents are far more stringent than for their counterparts across the border, but as this case and others like it highlight, with such vast sums of money at stake US institutions are far from immune to corruption. According to a report on corruption among border officials issued by the Center for Investigative Reporting, 125 out of 152 highlighted cases between 2005 and 2012 were directly tied to drug trafficking, bribery or human smuggling -- all offences closely associated with organized crime. The sentencing of Herrera-Chiang comes on the back of other recent cases of corruption among CBP officers, and corruption has surged alongside an exponential growth in the number of agents employed -- the force grew 40 percent between 2006 and 2012. Earlier this year, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a letter to both legislative chambers of the US government, highlighting the growth of the CBP and calling for standardized integrity training within the force.	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
Dismantled Chile Cocaine Lab With Bolivia Ties Hints at Evolving Crime Dynamics. Chilean authorities have dismantled yet another cocaine lab, used by a group of Bolivians and Chileans to process the drug into its liquid form, suggesting that Chile's role in the drug trade may be evolving beyond that of a transshipment point. Following a six-month investigation, Chilean police seized more than 530 kilograms of cocaine and dismantled a large cocaine processing laboratory in the town of Nancagua, roughly 200 kilometers south of the capital Santiago, reported Publimetro on March 28. In addition to impounding 450 kilograms of liquid cocaine and 85 kilograms of cocaine base, authorities arrested four Chileans who allegedly smuggled the product into the country, and two Bolivians who would process the drug into its liquid form. Police also found precursor chemicals needed to process the drug into its liquid form, reported Cooperativa. Carlos Yanez, the head of the Antinarcotics and Organized Crime Brigade (Brigada Antinarcoticos y Contra el Crimen Organizado), said that the criminal group was also involved in distributing some of the product in the Santiago metropolitan area, according to Publimetro. The official also noted that this was the fourth cocaine lab dismantled in the country this year. A total of 16 were discovered last year. The size of the most recently dismantled lab, combined with the fact that nearly 20 other such facilities have been discovered in the past year, suggests that Chile's role in the drug trade might be evolving beyond that of a transshipment country with a sizeable domestic consumption market. Rather than importing refined cocaine products for sale in Chile, crime groups there now appear to be refining the drug themselves. The dismantled structure appears to have exploited Chile's local consumption market, one of the largest in Latin America, to distribute part of the drugs smuggled in the country. This might have been done by selling directly the cocaine paste -- a cheap form of the drug whose widespread consumption has become a serious challenge for many South American nations -- or refining the product into cocaine powder, which can be sold at a higher price. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Chile The impounded liquid cocaine, however, was almost certainly destined for exportation. This form -- which was first discovered in 2011 in Bolivia according to BBC Mundo -- is much harder for authorities to detect, and thus easier for traffickers to smuggle across borders. In addition, reports have signaled Chile's role as a transshipment point to be growing. But if both the cocaine base and the two chemists originated from Bolivia, it is surprising that the suspects chose to process the drug into its liquid form in Chile rather than in Bolivia, which would likely have rendered the smuggling of the product across the border less risky. One of the reasons that may explain this decision is the accessibility in Chile of precursor chemicals needed for the process, partly due to the country's vast chemical industry. But whereas Chile's precursors were traditionally shipped north to coca-producing countries -- in particular Bolivia and Peru -- the total of 20 dismantled labs since 2016 suggest that this trend may be evolving, and that Chile may become an important processing country in the drug trade, in addition to being a consumption and transshipment point.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Guatemala Captures Brother of Heroin King. Guatemala authorities have captured the alleged heir to one of the nation's preeminent drug trafficking clans, possibly marking the end of the network and putting its lucrative drug territory up for grabs. On August 24, Guatemala's Attorney General's Office announced the capture of Rony Alexander Ortiz Lopez, alias ""El R,"" and three of his bodyguards in the department of San Marcos. He stands accused of racketeering and conspiracy to commit murder. (See video below) The capture of Rony Alexander Ortiz Lopez, alias ""El R,"" is announced Rony Ortiz is assumed to have taken over the drug operations of his brother, Juan Alberto Ortiz Lopez , alias ""Chamale"" -- also known as Guatemala's ""Heroin King""- who was extradited to the United States in 2014. Prior to his arrest in 2011, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) considered Chamale to be Guatemala's top drug trafficker, serving as a key contact for Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and moving drugs through Central America using small fishing boats and possibly semi-submersibles. Sitting along the Mexican border, San Marcos -- the Ortiz Lopez clan's base of operations -- serves as an important landing point for South American cocaine and is also a major poppy production area , the raw material for heroin. Rony Ortiz's arrest may mark the final chapter for the Ortiz Lopez drug trafficking clan. Under Chamale, the clan accumulated wealth and power, as well as the attention of both local and international authorities. However, after Chamale's arrest, the organization is reported to have lost territory and influence under the leadership of Rony Ortiz. With his arrest, rivals may now look to take control of the group's valuable San Marcos territory. On a larger scale, Rony Ortiz's capture can be seen as the death rattle of Guatemala's previous generation of drug traffickers. In the wake of the Zetas' violent rise and fall in Guatemala, as well as major blows to organized crime by former Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz , many of the Guatemala underworld's old guard are now dead or in prison. Most recently, in July, Guatemala extradited brutal drug trafficker Jairo Orellana , alias ""El Pelon,"" to the United States. The move added the onetime Zetas' ally to a long list of declining Guatemalan criminal groups, including the Mendoza clan , the Lorenzanas , and the Leones. Nonetheless, with major drug buyers like Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel still eager for more product, it's only a matter of time before new drug trafficking organizations fill the vacuum in Guatemala."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
Mexicos 2011 Drug War Statistics Show Drop in Seizures. Mexico's security forces have released statistics on the year's counternarcotics operations, which indicate a drop in both eradication efforts and drug seizures since 2010. According to the statistics from Mexico's Defense Department (SEDENA) , the country's armed forces captured 11,544 people suspected of links to organized crime in 2011. Authorities did not say how this figure relates to last year's total, but according to the U.S. State Department's 2011 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), Mexico arrested just over 28,000 Mexican nationals on drug-related charges in 2010. This would seem to indicate a massive drop in captures, though it is not clear whether these two numbers can be compared. SEDENA also claims to have eradicated nearly 14,800 hectares of poppy in 2011, along with almost 12,600 of marijuana. According to INCSR data, this is down from some 17,000 hectares of marijuana destroyed in 2010, while poppy cultivation remains stable. Authorities also claimed to have seized some 1,600 tons of marijuana and five tons of cocaine, down from just over 2,200 and 9.4, respectively, in 2010 (again according to the INSCR). The apparent drop in eradication and seizures does not bode well for President Felipe Calderon's security agenda. Calderon has often come under fire for the country's climbing murder rate , and the latest data seems to undercut the president's insistence that the uptick in violence is merely a response to increased law enforcement. 	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"US Sanctions Colombia Soccer Club for Crime Ties. The US Treasury has accused Envigado soccer club in Colombia of laundering money for the Oficina de Envigado, in a new financial assault against the Medellin crime syndicate, and the latest example of the long history of ties between crime and soccer. Envigado FC, and majority shareholder Juan Pablo Upegui Gallego, were among 10 people and 14 businesses placed on the Treasury's ""Kingpin List"" for their alleged collusion with the Oficina de Envigado, the drug trafficking and organized crime network that has ruled Medellin since the demise of Pablo Escobar. According to the Treasury , Upegui Gallego is ""a key associate within La Oficina and has used his position as the team's owner to put its finances at the service of La Oficina for many years."" Upegui later issued a statement denying any criminal ties. Among those singled out by the Treasury are alleged Oficina underbosses responsible for violence, extortion and drug trafficking, a high-ranking member of Envigado's Transit Police, and a former policeman allegedly turned Oficina enforcer. The individuals and businesses named by the Treasury now face financial sanctions that prohibit US citizens from doing business with them and freeze any US assets they have. Envigado FC has long had a reputation for two things: nurturing young talent such as Colombian soccer superstar James Rodriguez, and maintaining ties to the underworld and drug trafficking. The club was founded by Upegui's father Gustavo Adolfo Upegui Lopez, who was believed to be a close friend and ally first of Pablo Escobar, and later of his successor as Medellin kingpin, Diego Murillo, alias ""Don Berna."" In 2006, Gustavo Upegui was tortured and murdered, allegedly at the hands of Oficina commander Daniel Mejia, alias ""Danielito,"" who believed Upegui had grown too powerful. Envigado is far from the only point of crossover between Colombian soccer and organized crime. Cali based club America de Cali was on the US Kingpin List for 14 years due to its ties to the Cali Cartel, while Bogota clubs Millonarios and Santa Fe also had connections to infamous drug lords. However, the decision to place Envigado FC on the US Kingpin List is not only a reminder of the long-standing ties between soccer and organized crime, it is also another sign that the Oficina de Envigado is firmly in the sights of US authorities. Since the Treasury labeled the Oficina a ""specially designated narcotics trafficker"" in June this year , it has added 30 people and 28 businesses to the Kingpin List. In many respects, the Oficina is a shadow of its former self; fragmented into factions without clear leadership, and having lost its monopoly on Medellin crime by entering into a power-sharing deal with the rival Urabenos in 2013. However, the campaign spearheaded by the US Treasury suggests the authorities believe the Oficina is still a major player both within Colombia and in the world of international drug trafficking."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Paraguay Launches Anti-Guerrilla Offensive After Rancher Assassination. The murder of a well-known cattle farmer in Paraguay has put the activities of left-wing guerrillas in the country at the top of the country's political agenda, with joint military and police operations planned in rural areas. Interior Minister Carmelo Caballero announced the creation of a ""Crisis Commission"" to track and attack members of the Paraguayan People's Army (EPP) in the departments of San Pedro and Concepcion, reported Info BAE , following last Friday's assassination of Luis Lindstron, a 63-year-old cattle rancher and former mayor of the San Pedro town of Tacuati. Lindstron had been kidnapped by the EPP in 2008 and according to family members had been regularly extorted and threatened since, reported ABC. Tacuati mayor Orlando de Vaca said there were only 15 to 20 police working in the 228,000 hectare area, where people lived under ""constant threat"" from the EPP due to the conflict between guerrilla interests and local farming. ""The community feels very scared,"" he said. ""[The EPP] don't want us to carry out deforestation, to industrialize the land () but if we are poor what are we going to do?"" Lindstron had given work to 50 percent of the Tacuati population, he told radio station Cardinal. Lindstron's killing is the first murder of a rancher in Paraguay, reported Info BAE , and has sparked widespread anger and controversy about the EPP's power and government incompetence or collusion. Lindstron's brothers have accused both former President Fernando Lugo and the police of being to blame for the killing - Lugo for ""protecting"" the EPP, and the police for failing to take seriously the regular threats their relative received since his 2008 kidnapping. Threats had been increasing in frequency and seriousness, reported ABC , most recently in the form of a note received by Lindstron on April 18 following the murder of a tractor operator in his area, warning him he would be kidnapped or killed. Senator Hugo Richer told radio station Radio Nanduti that the real issue was the mafias controlled by powerful economic and political interests, for whom the EPP was a front, while San Pedro prosecutor Lillian Ruiz told Monumental radio Lindstron had believed local police might sell him to the guerrillas. It's a troubling scene that suggests the, albeit small, guerrilla group is wielding considerable clout following last year's surge, during which it carried out 40 percent of its total attacks since 2005. Lindstron's killing raises the question of whether the security forces are either unable or unwilling to truly get to grips with the EPP threat."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Uruguays Security Minister: ""Feudalization"" of Drug Trafficking. In an academic forum in Montevideo, Uruguay's Interior Minister Eduardo Bonomi said the country is experiencing a ""feudalization"" of the criminal world in that country, a report by El Pais newspaper said. The minister made specific reference to Serbian, Mexican, Colombian and Brazilian criminal networks that are infiltrating the country, a process the minister worries will accelerate Uruguayan groups' learning curve.

"El Salvador Church a Target for Extortion: Archbishop. Priests in El Salvador are reportedly being targeted by extortion rackets, revealing that gangs are diversifying one of their top sources of income to include civil society as well as the private sector. Jose Luis Escobar, the archbishop of San Salvador, stated on September 16, that priests have been targeted by gangs running extortion rackets , reported La Prensa Grafica. Though extortion demands do involve money, the archbishop said that ""sometimes we have been extorted because we have food, and because we have resources that we use to help the poor."" So far, no church member had been hurt as a result of their refusal to comply with the demands. Recent figures from El Salvador's National Civil Police (PNC) show that there have been 2,041 extortion complaints registered so far this year, with 129 of those coming from small-to-medium sized businesses and 102 from transportation companies, a popular target among extortionists because of the amount of cash bus drivers have on hand each day. The Catholic Church does not keep track of the amount of extortion threats it receives, Escobar said. The church, following its role in the negotiation of a truce between leaders of the MS-13 and Barrio 18 in March, has sought to extend the agreement to cover extortion as well as violence rates. They have failed to see any success in this however, likely because extortion constitutes one of the maras' main sources of income. While the number of reported extortion cases has been on the decline, -- 2,926 cases were registered last year between January and November, a 20 percent drop on 2010 figures -- the numbers are still alarmingly high. What's more, the archbishop's announcement indicates that gangs are diversifying to social sectors rather than focusing solely on businesses. Escobar noted however, that the fact that no church member had been harmed so far meant gangs still respect the institution. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has offered to train a new special task force in El Salvador , comprised of about 60 police and prosecutors, specifically to investigate extortion threats against smaller-sized businesses."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Honduras Struggles to Prosecute Suspects. A recent report from Honduras revealed how alleged criminals are arrested and released numerous times without ever going to trial, indicating the pressing need for judicial reform in one of the most violent countries in the world. Alleged gang members and criminals in Honduras are repeatedly getting caught and released by authorities, as prosecutors consistently fail to produce enough evidence to press charges, reported La Tribuna. In one example, an alleged member of street gang the Barrio 18, Joaquin Ernesto Garcia Orellana, alias ""El Topo,"" has 17 arrest warrants on record, ranging from car theft to homicide charges, according to La Tribuna. He was arrested in January after he was caught driving a stolen vehicle while wearing a police vest, but was released due to lack of evidence. He was most recently detained by police in August. The Honduran newspaper also described a case involving a woman with 10 arrest warrants to her name who has been detained at least three times, but never formally prosecuted; there is also the case of an alleged Barrio 18 member who was accused of involvement in the assassination of the son of a top police official , but despite being arrested was never charged with any crime. The cases highlighted by La Tribuna point to a difficult security dilemma common throughout much of Latin America. On the one hand, Honduran prisons have swelled far beyond capacity thanks to the widespread use of pre-trial detention and the government's hardline ""Mano Dura"" (Iron Fist) approach to crime. According to the country's Secretariat for Human Rights, less than half of the Honduras' 16,000 prisoners have been convicted of a crime. But the situation described by La Tribuna's report, recurring cases of repeat offenders who are arrested -- but never prosecuted -- is another problem. As one of the poorest countries in Latin America , Honduras cannot easily allocate more government resources to prosecutors and overwhelmed court systems, but without some kind of judicial reform the country's security situation is unlikely to improve. Other countries in Latin America face similar security issues. In Colombia only 15 percent of those arrested end up incarcerated, yet endemic overcrowding has recently led to hunger strikes in the country's prisons."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
More Kidnappings of Migrants. Authorities reported several more kidnappings of migrants in Mexico, including a case in Tijuana where 17 migrants continue missing, La Hora newspaper reports. Other cases stretched from Cuncun to the border with Guatemala. Ten thousand immigrants were kidnapped and held for ransom between September 2008 and February 2009, according to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission. This includes 72 people from parts of Central and South America that were kidnapped and killed by the criminal group known as the Zetas in Tamaulipas province along the Texas border last week. 	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
"Oil Theft is Big Business for Mexican Gangs. Theft from Mexico 's state oil company Pemex appears to have shifted from a small-scale criminal nuisance into big business, with actors such as the Zetas and Sinaloa Cartel increasingly getting involved. The oil company, which provides the Mexican government with roughly a third of its operating budget, has long been plagued by robberies. In the past, these were typically carried out by small-scale gangs or Pemex distributors, and would involve intentionally mislabeling gasoline products, or selling off gas siphoned from pipelines at below-market prices. During the Calderon administration, however, both the type of robberies and the perpetrators have changed, as Proceso reports , based on an internal Pemex document. Today, crude oil is being stolen on a wide scale, and the groups behind the theft are not small-scale gangs or businessmen gaming the system, but rather criminal networks like the Zetas. Furthermore, instead of reselling the oil at Pemex stations, the criminal groups are exploiting their international reach to sell it on to US refineries. The geography of illegal siphons discovered in recent years demonstrates the growing role of organized crime groups -- initially the Zetas, and increasingly, it would appear, the Sinaloa Cartel. According to Proceso, the two states where the largest number of illegal siphons were discovered in the first half of 2010 were Veracruz and Nuevo Leon, both of them notorious havens of Zeta activity. Sinaloa was third, followed by Puebla and then*Tamaulipas, which is also a Zeta stronghold. But according to a recent report from Excelsior , Sinaloa became the state worst-hit by pipeline theft in 2011, leapfrogging the two Zetas-held states that were ahead of it in 2010. The Zetas are known for their diverse revenue sources, involved in activities like extortion, pirate merchandise, kidnapping, car theft, and other rackets, in addition to oil theft. It is no surprise that Zetas-dominated states have seen a spike in stolen hydrocarbons. In contrast, the Sinaloa Cartel has a reputation for sticking to drug trafficking. In 2010, for instance, a captured high-ranking member of the Sinaloa Cartel told authorities that the cartel boss Joaquin "" El Chapo "" Guzman had prohibited his subordinates from supplementing their wages by kidnapping. Other groups also operate in the Sinaloa state, such as the Beltran Leyva Organization , but the scale of the thefts suggests that the Sinaloa Cartel, as the foremost network in the region, is involved. If this is the case, it would seem to represent a significant shift in the group's modus operandi. Pemex has discovered 5,000 illegal siphons since Calderon took office in late 2006, with more than 1,300 of those found last year. Some 3 million barrels of hydrocarbons were stolen in 2011, an increase of 52 percent from the previous year. This caused losses of roughly $475 million to the company, which had revenues in 2010 of nearly $80 billion. In response, Mexican authorities have ramped up investigations into the robberies; just 161 were opened in 2007, but more than 1,000 were opened last year. Most of those arrested for stealing oil have been linked to the Familia Michoacana and the Zetas, though the small-time operations have not entirely disappeared from the game. In addition to the vast sums to be made, stealing oil and gas is an attractive business for a number of other reasons. Neither Pemex nor the Mexican government have the resources to patrol the thousands of miles of pipelines, meaning that the product can be stolen with relatively low risk. Furthermore, as InSight Crime has pointed out , the large bureaucracy in Pemex also generates a large number of targets for corruption. In many cases, people within the company have taken part in the robberies. And as Excelsior notes, while it may sound sophisticated, robbing oil or gas from a pipeline is a low-tech business. As InSight Crime has reported , oil and gas theft are a serious issue for Latin American oil companies in countries including Colombia, Venezuela, and Bolivia. Hydrocarbon theft became a big source of funds for paramilitary group the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), with $10 million disappearing from 2001 to 2003 from AUC territory.

Peru Launches Dual Strategy to Tackle Illegal Mining Boom. Peru's government is targeting the illegal gold trade by declaring illegal mining an organized crime activity while launching a new formalization program for miners, in a carrot and stick strategy that history suggests will be difficult to implement. Justice and Human Rights Minister Marisol Perez Tello has told Peruvian press that illegal mining, along with related activities including the trafficking of equipment and substances used in mining and the financing of illegal mining, are to be incorporated into the country's Organized Crime Law, reported El Peruano. The decision will mean authorities can now investigate a case while the accused is detained for up to 36 months and grants extra powers to investigators such as the use of undercover agents. In addition, Energy and Mines Minister Gonzalo Tamayo announced the launch of a new plan for the formalization of miners. The government's aim is to formalize half of the estimated 100,000-120,000 illegal miners in the country, reported El Comercio. The new plan will seek to simplify the procedures required to formalize and incentivize miners by offering credit and facilitating the granting of mining titles. According to the minister, the government will differentiate between illegal miners and informal miners who can be brought into the legal economy by determining which operate in areas where mining is prohibited and which just lack proper authorization and permits. Disentangling informal and illegal mining is one of the greatest challenges governments such as Peru's face when it comes to tackling the illegal mining boom that has ravaged parts of Latin America in recent years. Indiscriminate operations that criminalize all mining that is not legal puts the livelihoods of thousands of people and the economic future of mining territories at risk. However, the infiltration and co-optation of informal mining by criminal networks makes drawing a neat line between the criminal and the informal extremely difficult. Tackling the issue from both sides -- cracking down on the illegal while seeking to formalize the informal -- is a strategy countries impacted by illegal mining are now settling on as the best way to address this situation. However, such attempts are not new for Peru, and their prior record is not good. The previous formalization campaign saw approximately 70,000 miners sign up to be integrated into the legal mining industry. However, several years later, only 161 mining operations representing approximately 3,000 people have completed the process, El Peruano cited Tamayo as saying.	0	0	1	0	0	1	0
"Honduras Arrest Highlights Importance of Being Mayor. The arrest of a mayor in Honduras on charges of multiple homicide draws attention to the larger regional problem of corruption among local officials, one boosted by the increase in power of these municipal governments. Jose Adalid Gonzalez, the mayor of Sulaco in north-central Honduras, was detained on October 22 for heading a criminal organization named ""Los Banegas,"" reported El Heraldo. ""Los Banegas"" is suspected of a number of crimes including multiple murders between 2010 and 2013, land and cattle theft and the assault of transport vehicles. La Prensa says Honduran authorities have begun exhuming the bodies of their victims to gather evidence against the group. The mayor himself also stands accused of the murders of Secundino Orellana Romero and Medardo Anselmo Romero Ramos, news reports say. Orellano Romero was killed in June 2013 in an exchange of fire with the mayor and his men, according to investigations. Witnesses claim the mayor had a Mini-Uzi, while his bodyguards were armed with pistols. Romeo Ramos was killed months later in front of dozens of witnesses, reportedly on the mayor's orders. Over 200 police agents arrested the mayor after months of investigation. Seven other members of the criminal group were apprehended three months ago. Gonzalez is the second mayor of the Yoro province in north-central Honduras to be arrested for alleged criminal activity. Arnaldo Urbina Soto , also of the National Party, was captured in July 2014 for heading a gang dedicated to drug trafficking and murder, among other crimes. Latin America has a rising number of crooked local officials participating in -- or even leading -- criminal organizations. Behind this is a major shift in national power distribution. The growing decentralization of authority in these countries has handed local governors more control over budget and security forces, which has placed the mayoral seat in the sights of illegal groups: mayors are being targeted by illegal groups and co-opted into becoming criminals; or criminals are running for mayor and winning. This trend was perhaps most brutally exposed recently with the discovery that the mayor of Iguala, Mexico, and his wife were the figureheads of Guerreros Unidos -- a local group accused of carrying out the disappearance and presumed killing of 43 students in September 2014. In Colombia, the interweaving of crime and local governance was seen only last Sunday in the ironic case of a candidate who was voted in as mayor from behind bars. But the result of the coveted value of this local seat is not only the criminalization of officials. It has also entailed an increase in violent attacks on mayors. This month alone has seen a Honduran mayor tortured and killed, as well as the murder of mayors in Peru , Guatemala , and Brazil. While Colombia began the decentralization of its government in the 1980s , in Honduras this process began in the 1990s and continues to receive further momentum , which may only enhance the importance of being mayor."	0	1	0	1	0	0	0
"Colombia to Negotiate with FARC. After weeks of rumored negotiations, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has confirmed that the government will begin peace talks with the country's largest guerrilla group in Havana, Cuba. President Santos has confirmed reports that the Colombian government is gearing up to begin peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ), and has conducted ""exploratory talks"" with rebels. According to reports by RCN Radio and Venezuela's Telesur , the Colombian government and guerrilla representatives signed a preliminary agreement in Havana, Cuba. The agreement apparently lays the basis for future talks to be held in Oslo, Norway beginning on October 5. If these are successful, the negotiations will continue in Havana. This report comes one week after former President Alvaro Uribe accused the government of negotiating with the rebel group , something that President Santos had previously dismissed. If the talks move forward as planned, this would mark a historic turn for the FARC's nearly 50-year conflict with the government. The last round of official talks took place over a decade ago between 1999 and 2002 under then-President Andres Pastrana. The details of this latest truce are not clear. The Oslo negotiations will reportedly revolve around six themes, which according to Caracol Radio include: rural poverty and development, participation in the political process, turning in arms, truth and reconciliation,drug trafficking, and insecurity. So far there have been no reports that the FARC will be temporarily granted any territory as a safe haven, a feature of the last round of talks which has been widely criticized since. As part of a gesture of good faith, the Pastrana government ceded a Switzerland-sized swath of land in the south of the country to the guerrillas by demilitarizing the area. The FARC then famously used this area to regroup, stepping up recruitment and attacks in rural areas. One of the biggest variables in a future peace process is the percentage of guerrillas which would actually participate. Many analysts fear that it could mirror the failed demobilization of the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia ( AUC ) from 2003 to 2006, when many mid-level commanders and those under them demobilized in name only, later returning to their criminal past. These successors to the AUC are today known as BACRIM (""criminal bands""), and include major players in the drug trade like the Urabenos. The risk of the FARC following a similar path in the aftermath of negotiations is difficult to gauge. The question amounts to a test of the prevailing narrative of the guerrilla group: that despite their roots in Marxist rhetoric of class struggle and popular uprising, the political cohesiveness of the FARC has become eroded due to its involvement in criminal activities like drug trafficking, arms trafficking and kidnapping. The group's political integrity is also believed to have been affected by the loss of several members of its leading Secretariat in recent years, many of whom (like former leader* alias ""Alfonso Cano"" ) were considered ideological heavyweights within the organization. At the same time, the FARC still largely conform to a military hierarchy, as has been recently demonstrated by its overall adherence to a self-imposed* ban on kidnapping civilians *in February. While this was apparently broken with the April kidnapping of French journalist Romeo Langlois, the rebels eventually released Langlois after initially claiming that he was a legitimate ""prisoner of war."" Ultimately, if the Secretariat were to engage the government in meaningful peace negotiations, they still have the capacity to speak for the organization as a whole, although there would likely be at least some dissidents who do not comply. If such a split happened it could take a toll on Colombia's crime rate. Kidnapping has risen so far in 2012, but the rebels' share of the crime has fallen considerably since their announcement in February. With the prospect of dissident FARC cells who do not properly demobilize, their involvement in the crime may rise as well, causing the number of kidnappings to increase. The splintering of the FARC could also affect the dynamics of cocaine production in the country. The guerrillas are known to control many rural areas where coca is grown, and are believed to sell coca base to BACRIM for processing. With the ideological barriers of the armed conflict removed by a potential FARC demobilization, certain rebel factions may develop even closer ties to BACRIM groups, resulting in more fluid production chains from field to laboratory."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Internal Strife Within the CJNG in Baja California, Mexico. The defection of a Jalisco Cartel New Generation cell in Baja California has stoked the flames of violence and highlighted internal problems within one of Mexico's most powerful criminal groups. A series of murders of hitmen that had allegedly parted ways with the CJNG (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion - CJNG) in the state of Baja California has sounded the alarms and generated a wave of violence in recent weeks, Zeta Tijuana reported. The hitmen were reportedly part of ""Los Cabos,"" a group which has distanced itself from the CJNG due to alleged disagreements with the cartel's new leadership structure. In doing so, the group lost its ""protection"" against the Sinaloa Cartel, which also has a strong presence in the area, according to Zeta Tijuana. Local media reports that clashes between Los Cabos and the CJNG have generated a wave of violence so far this year, including 16 murders in the city of Tecate along the US-Mexico border in Baja California. Further to the west in Tijuana, at least two of the 670 homicides reported between May and August were related to the conflict, according to Sin Embargo. The clashes between Los Cabos and the CJNG in Baja California have placed a spotlight on the internal divisions the cartel is confronting in and around an extremely strategic drug trafficking corridor. The CJNG's internal conflict started when Los Cabos decided to leave the organization due to discrepancies with the group's new structure. CJNG leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias "" El Mencho , "" has been forced to keep a low profile as authorities in the United States and Mexico have issued arrest warrants and multimillion-dollar rewards for information leading to his capture. The CJNG's internal strife is occurring amid a long-standing dispute with one of Mexico's most powerful criminal groups, the Sinaloa Cartel, for control of a particularly strategic drug trafficking zone nestled along the US-Mexico border. Disputes between local drug traffickers have led to an increase in violence in this region, which helped Tijuana become one of Mexico's most violent cities in the world in 2018. This is not the first time that the CJNG has faced internal divisions. In 2018, the group had issues related to a rift with the Nueva Plaza Cartel -- many of whose members used to belong to the CJNG -- in Guadalajara, the heart of Jalisco state and the CJNG's operational center. The CJNG's current dilemma is that it now has to fight on two fronts. On the one end, the group is trying to control the Los Cabos splinter group that is attacking them in Tecate, Tijuana and Rosario. On the other end, they're vying with the Sinaloa Cartel for control of drug routes in Baja California and Baja California Sur."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"How Would El Salvadors Presidential Candidates Tackle Organized Crime?The citizens of El Salvador are set to elect a new president on February 3 amid an uptick in deadly violence in January, which has thrust the country's security situation back into the spotlight. There is growing acknowledgment of the need for a significant shift in security policy. And all the presidential candidates are discussing preventive measures to address crime and violence in a more thorough way than in years past. That said, detailed proposals of how best to address violent crime, the country's two most prominent gangs -- Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Barrio 18 -- and their growing influence over the country's electoral process , as well as the weaponization of the national police, have largely remained absent from the official political discourse. As Salvadoran journalist Carlos Dada noted in a recent interview , ""finding a political solution to the structural causes that permit organized crime (mainly gangs)"" is likely to be the biggest challenge El Salvador's next president will face. Below, InSight Crime looks at the security platforms proposed by the three most viable candidates. Hugo Martinez - FMLN After taking office in 2014, Salvador Sanchez Ceren's time as president of El Salvador is coming to a close. His ruling Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional - FMLN) -- in power for the last 10 years -- has well-known politician Hugo Martinez campaigning on the political party's behalf. For his part, Martinez has proposed a vague security platform that's short on detail and centers on using ""all the public force to guarantee security and tranquility."" Specifically, Martinez's platform stresses that building up the capacity of the national police and deploying them nationwide will improve security and strengthen the much-touted citizen security initiative Plan Secure El Salvador (Plan El Salvador Seguro - PESS) launched in 2015 by Sanchez Ceren, though the plan's efficacy remains uncertain. His plan would ""promote the greatest deployment of the state to reinforce violence prevention strategies and defeat crime,"" in addition to ""ensuring the state's territorial control by combining police intelligence with scientific investigation of crimes."" While prevention has been in the FMLN's past security narratives, the party appears to be pushing again for a more ""mano dura"" approach, promoting heavy-handed security strategies and weaponizing the police. Authorities have deployed and extended extraordinary security measures against the country's gangs for years under current President Sanchez Ceren and those who came before him. But while officials have used these measures to explain drops in the country's homicide rate and tout alleged security gains , insecurity remains and it's more likely that a variety of complex factors are contributing to the decrease in violence. Martinez himself admitted in a recent debate that ""progress has been made, but not enough has been done."" However, it doesn't appear that Martinez and the FMLN -- which reached agreements with the gangs to influence presidential elections in the past -- have any clear proposals to address El Salvador's gangs or short- and long-term security concerns despite claims that this would be a "" priority "" for his administration. Nayib Bukele - GANA Recent polls show that former FMLN member and former San Salvador mayor Nayib Bukele continues to maintain a lead in the race for president and could even win the elections outright, running on behalf of the Grand Alliance for National Unity (Gran Alianza por la Unidad Nacional - GANA) opposition party. With regard to public security, Bukele's platform focuses heavily on prevention and finding new ways to improve the capacity of security forces using technology. Bukele is proposing that El Salvador's national police and armed forces help design and implement intervention programs in schools that are designed to establish anti-violence practices. The presidential hopeful is also proposing to establish alliances with civil society organizations to reduce the conditions that cause violence and marginalization and increase risk factors, among other things. ""The problem with the criminal groups that attack security forces is they cannot be treated exclusively from a crime-fighting optic, since it is a social problem where the lack of opportunities and life choices begin to produce a vicious cycle of poverty, crime, and violence,"" Bukele's plan states. In addition to prevention, Bukele proposed increasing the technical capacity of the national police and creating a border protection plan against transnational drug trafficking coordinated by various security institutions. The so-called Northern Triangle region of Central America has grown in importance recently as a key transshipment point for drug loads arriving from South America amid a boom in cocaine production. However, criminal groups have in the past shown an ability to outwit authorities and their high-tech resources with basic technology, such as Global Positioning System (GPS). Bukele is also proposing the creation of an internationally-backed commission against impunity and corruption for El Salvador, similar to the anti-graft bodies in neighboring Guatemala and Honduras that have sent former presidents and vice presidents to prison, and investigated the alleged criminality of other powerful elites. Still, serious questions remain about Bukele's ability to confront the gangs and insecurity in the country, especially through an anti-corruption commission. During his time as San Salvador mayor, for example, Bukele made deals with the gangs and promised to give them benefits in exchange for ""providing security and giving access to territories under their control for campaign activities."" This and other questionable actions would put him directly in the crosshairs of such a commission. Carlos Calleja - ARENA In a move that goes against much of what the ultra-right Nationalist Republican Alliance (Alianza Republicana Nacionalista - ARENA) political party has campaigned on in the past regarding citizen security -- ARENA was the party that first unveiled Plan Mano Dura in 2003 -- presidential nominee Carlos Calleja's security proposals focus heavily on preventive measures rather than repression to thwart the spread of crime and violence. ""It is important to point out that what has been done so far has not worked, we have to look for a bold solution, a comprehensive vision and execute more prevention programs,"" Calleja said during a recent debate. In part, Calleja has pledged continued support for the National Council for Citizen Security and Coexistence (Consejo Nacional de Seguridad Ciudadana y Convivencia - CNSCC), which was created in 2014 to promote dialogue and agreement on public policies involving citizen security. As for working to dismantle the country's criminal structures, Calleja has vowed to coordinate public services and social policies, in addition to improving accountability within the national police, restructuring the institution and allocating more resources towards training, forensic capabilities and police intelligence. Reforming El Salvador's police force -- defined in recent years by extrajudicial killings , human rights violations and death squads -- is critical, but past plans to do so have so far fallen short. ARENA and its members have also had dubious relationships of their own with the gangs during past election seasons, casting doubt on the party's promise to meaningfully address one of the main factors driving insecurity. In 2014, the ARENA-affiliated mayor of San Salvador gave the MS13 tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for their support for the party's presidential candidate at the time."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Who Will Pay for the War in Central America?Testimony at a recent hearing on U.S.-Central American security cooperation showcased one of Central America's key problems: These countries do not collect enough taxes to win the fight against organized crime. In a recent Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, Kevin Casas-Zamora -- who was Vice President of Costa Rica from 2006 to 2007 under Oscar Arias, and is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute -- told the committee that wealthy Central American elites are going to have to start footing the bill for security forces in their home countries, or face an increasingly difficult security situation. (Watch Senate hearing here .) ""Don't let the Central American elites, who have never paid taxes, off the hook this time,"" he told the committee. (To read Kevin Casas-Zamora's testimony click here. ) Central America ranks at the bottom in terms of tax revenue as a percentage of GDP. According to the World Bank 's most recent data from 2009, Central America's tax revenue falls below the average for not only Latin America, but even Sub-Saharan Africa (see chart below). (Source: World Bank) Guatemala has the lowest tax collection in the region, at only 10.4 percent of GDP, and has been the scene of particularly brutal crimes in recent months. The penetration of drug traffickers, and the weakness of the government, caused a United Nations body in the country to warn that it could become a ""narco-state."" Even the governments of countries such as Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Kosovo were able to collect more tax than Guatemala (full table below). The region, meanwhile, is suffering. Large criminal organizations, such as the Mexican-based Zetas and Sinaloa Cartel , have established bases throughout the isthmus, while Central America now suffers some of the highest homicide rates in the world. The security forces are woefully underpaid and under-trained. Many law enforcement officials work closely with local and foreign criminal organizations, taking part in smuggling drugs, kidnapping, extortion, and other illicit activities. The trend is region-wide. Most countries facing the challenges of organized crime do not collect taxes comparable to their counterparts in the developing world. Indeed, the wealthy tend to avoid taxes and buy their own social services, including private schools, hospitals and security. In Mexico , for example, there are approximately 8,000 private security firms, according to the State Department's 2010 Human Rights Report. The one exception may be Colombia. In 2002, newly elected president Alvaro Uribe took on Colombia's elite, raising over $800 million dollars with the implementation of a ""wealth tax."" The tax was so successful that a similar measure was implemented from 2007-2011, which according to the State Department was expected to raise an additional $3.7 billion dollars. Colombia's security situation has changed drastically since the measures were implemented. The military has killed and captured numerous top level guerrilla and paramilitary leaders. Some Central American governments are beginning to take heed. The government of El Salvador, for example, recently proposed a new tax intended to raise $380 million to combat crime.

"Coal Baron With Suspected Narco Ties Killed in Mexico. The assassination of a business leader in Mexico's coal mining industry -- who had been accused of ties to the Zetas criminal group -- is a reminder of the links between mining and organized crime in Latin America. On October 31, Jose Reynold Bermea Castilla, the owner of a coal mining company in the border state of Coahuila, was killed by a lone assassin near his home, reported El Financiero. Bermea Castilla was suspected by the authorities of using his mining business to launder money for the former head of the Zetas, Miguel Trevino, alias ""Z-40."" The mine owner was arrested in 2012 on charges of illegally possessing military-grade weapons, but was freed months later. Little information has been released regarding the circumstances of the killing. However, authorities said that it was an isolated case and that they would not increase security measures in the area, according to Zocalo. Bermea Castilla's murder points to the relationship between the mining industry and organized crime in Mexico. The country's mining industry is attractive for drug trafficking groups, in part because it is generally under lax state regulation and is considered an easy way to launder money. This dynamic has been seen for some time in Mexico. In 2012, former Coahuila Governor Humberto Moreira claimed that Zetas leader Heriberto ""Z-3"" Lazcano had run mining operations in the state. In early 2013, the federal Attorney General's Office (PGR) froze the accounts of 12 mining companies as authorities investigated them for ties to drug trafficking groups. The intersection between mining and organized crime is not unique to Mexico. The amount of money laundered through illegal gold mining in Peru reportedly rose by 50 percent from mid-2012 to early 2014. In Colombia, the lucrative emerald industry -- including the sector's now-dead top tycoon, Victor Carranza -- has long been linked to drug trafficking groups. While some of those in the mining sector may collaborate in laundering the profits of drug traffickers, criminal groups in Mexico have also turned to robbing mining companies as a way to supplement their income. In early 2014, a mining industry representative said that some mining companies had begun transporting products and personnel by air due to a growing number of robberies by criminal groups."	0	0	0	0	1	1	0
"Can Opposing Sides Reach Consensus on Colombia Peace Process?The FARC's commander in chief and Colombia's political opposition have staked out their positions on the renegotiation of a peace deal with the guerrilla group, but questions remain about whether or not the two sides are willing to make concessions on key points of disagreement. On October 12, the top leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), Rodrigo Londono Echeverri, alias ""Timochenko,"" suggested to Caracol Radio that his organization would not renegotiate any judicial benefits as part of ongoing attempts to salvage a peace process with his guerrilla movement. The interview was the first Timochenko has given since a nationwide referendum on October 2 rejected an agreement between the FARC and the government after four years of grueling talks in Havana, Cuba. Following the vote, government representatives and opposition politicians entered discussions to address concerns with the original deal and reach a viable alternative. When asked whether the FARC would be willing to reconsider the agreements reached in Havana regarding transitional justice and the rebels' eventual participation in politics, the guerrilla leader said, ""It would be a kneejerk reaction to relive a discussion that took usone and a half years, which was one of the hardest discussions."" On the same day as the Caracol interview, the main political party leading opposition to the signed peace deal, the Democratic Center (Centro Democratico), published a document with their proposals to modify elements of the process and form a ""Grand National Pact."" Many of the proposals made by the Democratic Center are similar to those included in the rejected agreement. For example, the document proposes that guerrillas responsible for human rights abuses who recognize their crimes would receive five to eight years of ""effective deprivation of liberties"" -- a condition similar to the contents of the previous agreement -- though the Democratic Center proposal specifies that this could include confinement in ""agricultural farms."" Those who are found guilty but refuse to admit to their crimes would be imprisoned for 15 to 20 years -- conditions identical to those in the previous deal. According to the original agreement, all guerrillas would be eligible to run for political office, regardless of crimes committed. The Democratic Center manifesto accepts the provisions of the previous deal that would have allowed the FARC to form a political party that would be guaranteed 10 seats in Congress for two four-year terms. But it also proposes a new condition: that guerrillas sentenced for crimes against humanity not be allowed to run for office. Perhaps the most substantial difference between the Democratic Center proposal and the previous agreement centers around the issue of the transitional justice mechanism. The opposition proposal asks that the ""Special Peace Jurisdiction"" that was to assume transitional justice responsibilities be replaced by a transitional justice system within Colombia's ordinary justice infrastructure. This would include ""Peace Courts"" within the Bogota Superior Court and units within the Attorney General's Office responsible for prosecuting conflict-related crimes. The Democratic Center proposal also differs from the previous deal in another important aspect: Drug trafficking would be treated as an ""autonomous crime that is not eligible for amnesty."" The explicit exclusion of drug trafficking from the list of pardonable crimes could prevent many FARC members, including important commanders, from receiving amnesty. As InSight Crime has previously reported , this could have major implications for the willingness of FARC fighters to participate in the transitional justice process. Regarding the previous agreement's ban on extradition of FARC members, the Democratic Center document suggests that this provision require FARC members seeking protection from extradition to contribute to the truth and justice process, provide reparation to victims and to not repeat their crimes -- a condition that also appears to be similar to the provisions of the rejected agreement. The Democratic Center also proposes that agents of state security forces who have been prosecuted or are under investigation for conflict-related crimes should be given the ""broadest benefits possible,"" including reducing their sentences, granting them conditional freedom ""as early as possible,"" and allowing them to be confined in military or police garrisons. The peace process now depends on just how many compromises the FARC leadership and the political opposition are willing to make. When talks with the FARC began four years ago, the guerrillas came to the table with some positions they described as non-negotiable: They would not hand over their weapons or go to prison, and they would be able to carry their movement over to the political sphere. They eventually conceded on the issue of disarmament, but Timochenko is clearly still standing firm to reach an agreement that keeps FARC members out of prison. This may reassure the guerrilla rank and file, but it could lead to a political stalemate over what is arguably the most important element of the peace process. However, it appears that opponents of the Havana deal may be willing to give some ground on the issue of jail time. Former President Andres Pastrana -- who also campaigned against the rejected agreement -- has presented his own recommendations for renegotiation, which do not seek prison sentences for most FARC members. And the Democratic Center's openness to confinement in ""farms"" as an alternative to jail cells may prove to be a form of ""deprivation of liberties"" that the FARC could be willing to accept. Similarly, there appears to be space for compromise on the issue of the FARC's eventual political participation. The opposition has decried the idea of FARC members sitting in Congress as one of the most outrageous conditions of the previous peace deal, but the Democratic Center has again been somewhat lenient in this area. Still, their proposal to ban human rights abusers from holding office would essentially rule out the entire FARC Secretariat and Central General Staff (Estado Mayor Central - EMC). The Attorney General's Office has found both responsible for ""war crimes"" for establishing the recruitment of minors as an organization-wide policy. This could prove to be a red line for FARC leaders with future political ambitions. While the opposing parties hammer out the future path of the peace process, there is a growing danger that with time, more FARC fighters will break away from the unstable deal. And there has been speculation that the leader of the Democratic Center, former President Alvaro Uribe, wants to draw out the re-negotiations until the next presidential elections in 2018, and use the situation as political fodder to boost his party's chances of electoral success. This dynamic means that a great deal depends on the ability of the negotiators to quickly find common ground on these contentious issues."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Animation Series Highlights Life in Venezuela Prisons. A seven episode animated series on Youtube offers an inside look at the violence and intrigue inside a Venezuelan prison. The series, ""Jail or Hell,"" was created and produced by Luidig Ochoa, a former inmate at Tocoron penitentiary some 100 kilometers outside of Caracas. After he was released from prison, Ochoa worked at several TV stations and the Ministry of Culture, before reportedly quitting to devote himself full time to his animation project. The seven episodes, each between six to 10 minutes long, follow the story of a prison boss (or ""pran"") who is driven out of power by a group of rivals. Each episode depicts different facets of prison life. The inmates are shown wearing civilian clothing or are shirtless, living in primitive facilities with cockroaches and graffiti decorating the walls. Knife battles and gun fights are a frequent occurrence. The pranes are depicted as enjoying privileges far above those available to the ordinary inmates, including private rooms decorated with pornography (convenient for conjugal visits), Blackberry cell phones, and the fear and respect of those around them. According to watchdog group the Venezuela Prison Observatory, 506 people were killed in Venezuela's prisons last year, while at least 304 inmates have died during the first half of 2012. The government only controls six out of Venezuela's 36 prisons, the NGO has said. ""Jail or Hell"" doesn't do much to humanize depictions of inmates. Tellingly, many of the characters are drawn with red, slitted eyes, as though to estrange the characters from the audience. The depiction of women in the series -- all tight clothes and exaggerated curves -- draws on the cheesiest anime cliches. Nevertheless the series is an intriguing depiction of how authority in the prison system works. The National Guard are only shown entering the prison grounds in order to do head counts. While gun battles rage inside the prison walls, the guards stand on a hill outside and observe. The series never bothers to show the clean up of the dozens of dead bodies that pile up, all of them oozing puddles of blood. There are only a few moments that hint at life outside the prison system. At one point, an inmate's interior monologue notes that he has been held in pre-trial detention for five months and is still waiting to hear back from the Ministry of Justice. This misuse of pre-trial detention is one reason why Venezuela's prisons are so overcrowded and deadly. In the first episode (watch below), one character explains in a flashback that he was imprisoned for killing the son of a powerful political authority with his taxi. It is one of the few times that the series makes references to some of the broader injustices in Venezuelan society that have helped make the prison system what it is today. But the show's real value may come from how willing it is to show prison violence as random and ready to erupt at any time. One character in the second episode is gunned down after he is mistaken for another inmate, suspected of spying on a pran who was having wild, graphic sex with a female visitor. Others are killed for less random reasons, usually involving rivalries between the prison bosses. The implicit message seems to be that if ""Prison or Hell"" is so willing to show life as disposable and cheap, it may simply be reflecting society's overall view of the populations most vulnerable to ending up in these brink and mortar infernos."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"McClatchy: Marijuana Booming. Mexico's marijuana business is booming, according to a McClatchy report in the Miami Herald. The story says that production is up 35 percent and 32,000 tons of the drug were produced in 2009, still much smaller than U.S. production, which is closer to 76,000 tons. It adds that peasant farmers who grow the drug, mostly in the so-called Golden Triangle of Durango, Sinaloa and Chihuahua states, do not see much risk because the army manual eradicates it; or much profit (slightly more than corn), but that the drug is the traffickers' ""cash cow.""

"Honduras Doubles Prison Terms for Extortion. The Honduran Congress passed legislation doubling the prison sentence for extortion, among other measures, raising questions about the government's anti-gang tactics and the strain being put on the country's penitentiaries. The new law, which will see the sentence for extortion increased from a maximum of nine years to 20 years, was passed by a unanimous vote, thus avoiding the two further debating sessions usually required in Congress. The sentence for homicide was also increased from 20 years to a maximum of life imprisonment and can now entail a fine of $16,000. The deputy of the ruling National Party, Ricardo Diaz, told media , ""The famous war tax charged by gang members will be part of the past because with this law we are responding to the cry of the people."" Mario Perez, another member of the National Party, also argued in favor of the new law, pointing to figures that suggest up to 6,000 businesses in Honduras have been declared bankrupt in recent years due to extortion, with some 200 people killed for refusing to pay. During the same congressional session, instigated by President Porfirio Lobo who sent the bill to Congress six months ago, the sentence for blackmail was increased from a maximum of nine years to 12. The new penalty for extortion is high in comparison with other countries in the region. In Guatemala, individuals charged with extortion face between six and 12 years in prison, according to EFE. Extortion is apparently on the rise in Honduras, with the National Criminal Investigation Directorate (DNIC) reporting 63 cases in 2012 so far, up from 42 for the same period last year. In one recent report , it was declared that over 500 schools in the capital Tegucigalpa are forced to pay extortion to local ""maras,"" or street gangs. Authorities claim that criminals usually charge taxi and bus drivers around $80 per month, with the fee for small to medium businesses rising to $600 a month in some cases. While the rise in extortion rates suggest a need to crack down on the crime, increased prison sentences may not be the right approach. Honduras' prison system is already under great strain , running at 60 percent over capacity, according to reports. The dangers of such overcrowding were brought to the fore with the devastating prison fire that killed 358 inmates in Comayagua. Creating an extra burden on the state, without addressing the need to finance improvements to the country's penal system, could be risky. Furthermore, imposing harsh sentences for extortion across the board has its dangers, as some operations may be relatively low level and run by small-time criminals. Placing them long term in prison system opens up avenues for them to foster ties with higher-level criminals -- for example from the MS-13 or Barrio 18 -- and strengthen larger criminal networks.

"UN: Violence, Gang Activity on the Rise in Caribbean. A new UN report paints an alarming picture of the crime surge in the Caribbean, a trend that may escalate if drug trafficking groups come under increasing pressure in Mexico and Central America. The report (.pdf) , the first one released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to examine security in the Caribbean, is the result of survey responses from some 11,555 citizens and interviews with 450 experts and politicians. According to the study, every Caribbean country except for two (Barbados and Suriname) saw an increase in homicide rates and gang-linked killings over the past 12 years. The decline in security is especially evident in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. Although Jamaica saw a seven-year low in homicides in 2011 , the 1,124 homicides registered last year make the island the most violent country in the Caribbean, with the third highest homicide rate in the world (60 murders per 100,000 inhabitants). While not as deadly, the homicide trend in Trinidad and Tobago is just as alarming. Over the past decade the island country saw its murder rate increase more than fivefold to 36 killings per 100,000 people, more than double the average homicide rate of the Americas at 15.6 per 100,000. The rise in violence has accompanied an increase in gang-related activity, the report finds. In 2009 officials estimated that about 35 percent of killings in Trinidad and Tobago were gang-related, up from 26 percent in 2006. In Jamaica the trend was even more pronounced, increasing from 33 to 48 percent in the same period. According to UN researchers, there is a high correlation between violence and gang membership, which is reflected in Jamaica. The island has the highest number of gangs in the region, with 268 criminal bands on its streets, the report says. One question is how much the growth in gang activity has been fed by the international drug trade. In the 1970s and '80s, the Caribbean was the primary transit point for cocaine headed to the US, until heightened security along the coast forced traffickers to turn to Mexico and Central America. Now, it seems those days may return. Last August, the Miami Herald quoted several US anti-drug officials who predicted that security crackdowns in Mexico and Central America will increase the flow of illicit drugs through the Caribbean in the coming years. In November, the State Department's top counternarcotics official, William Brownfield, echoed these claims. Saying Mexican groups like the Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel are ""in the process of being chased out of Mexico,"" he warned that the old Caribbean routes are looking more appealing to transnational drug traffickers. Law enforcement has already documented the shift in such places as Puerto Rico , Cuba , and Jamaica , where drug seizures have increased dramatically in recent years. One concern is that Caribbean gangs will seek a piece of the action, potentially becoming major players in the hemispheric drug trade. El Salvador's Mara Salvatrucha is reportedly attempting such a transition , and subsequently may have made itself a prime threat to security forces there. Fortunately, the UN report suggests that the region's gangs currently lack the organization to set up their own international export routes. The exception is in Jamaica, where large scale criminal organizations have a long history. These groups, known as ""posses,"" are usually very hierarchical, and often associated with local politics. If the flow of drugs through the Caribbean increases dramatically, Jamaica may be the country affected first. Still, this is likely a long way off. The likely trigger for this phenomenon, a successful security crackdown in Central America and Mexico, has not yet proved to be a deal breaker for drug traffickers. The Mexican border is still the primary entry point for drugs headed into the US, and drug cartels seem to be doubling down in Central America. While the international drug trade does represent a security threat to the Caribbean, in the near future local groups are unlikely to become players as prominent or powerful as those based in Mexico or Central America.

"Zetas Threaten Attacks on Civilians in North Guatemala. Banners threatening attacks on the civilian population, signed in the name of the Zetas drug gang, have appeared in Peten province, north Guatemala. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, two large pieces of cloth were hung in prominent places in the provincial capital Flores, with variations on the following message, reports Prensa Libre : To all the civil and military authorities and the general population stop persecuting the clan or we will start to kill, we are going to launch grenades in the discos and shopping malls of Peten this is Z territory, we don't want a war against the government, this is the warning. Sincerely, Z-200'' ""Z-200"" is the name used by a Zetas cell operating in Guatemala, but is also thought to be the alias of a Zetas commander based there. President Otto Perez said the authorities were investigating, and that they believed the messages were a product of rivalry between drug trafficking groups. The Zetas often hang public messages, known as ""narcomantas,"" on the streets of Mexico to communicate their plans or threaten rivals, but the practice is far less common in Guatemala. Earlier this month similar banners were hung in Guatemala City, also signed in the name of Z-200 and calling for drug legalization. However, as InSight Crime noted , these seemed more likely to have come from opponents of the president than from the Zetas themselves. The messages in Peten are more likely to be genuine -- the large, sparsely-populated province borders on the Zetas' home country of Mexico. The banners suggest that the Zetas are increasingly ready to stake their claim to the province, which has been a stronghold for the group since they began their move into Guatemala in earnest in 2008. Peten Governor Henry Amezquita said that the banners could be from the Zetas, but were just as likely to be the work of politicians trying to damage the government, reports elPeriodico. The newspaper says that the government has not ruled out imposing another state of emergency in Peten, following the declaration of a ""state of siege"" there in May last year, when the Zetas massacred 27 farmhands on a ranch. The tone of the banners suggests that the Zetas have a grievance against the authorities. This could mean that, following Perez's accession to the presidency in January, the group no longer have interlocutors in the government. Perez has promised to take a tough line on crime. On the day of his inauguration he announced plans to crack down on the Zetas, with a better-equipped and greater military presence. Since then, the security forces have captured Alvaro Gomez Sanchez, alias ""El Sapo Gomez,"" a suspected trafficker who is thought to work closely with the Zetas. On Monday, the security forces captured alleged Zetas commander Gustavo Adolfo Colindres Arreaga , alias ""Comandante Rochoy,"" in Peten, which may have sparked the latest communiques. The threats of reprisals against the civilian population are credible -- the Zetas are known for launching indiscriminate violent attacks, such as the arson of a Monterrey casino that killed 52 people last year, or the massacre of the Peten farm laborers.

"Guatemala to Tackle Femicide With New Task Force. Guatemalan President Otto Perez announced the creation of a new task force to combat the country's high rate of murders of women. The new unit against ""femicide"" will be coordinated by former prosecutor Mirna Carrera, and will aim to reduce the number of femicides by 25 per cent this year, reported Univision. In 2011, Guatemala saw roughly 700 women killed, making it the second most dangerous country in Latin America for women. Authorities also announced the creation of a separate force to counter kidnappings in Guatemala. This brings the total number of special task forces to five since Perez was inaugurated on January 14, with others created to combat extortion, vehicle theft and ""sicarios,"" or assasins. Perez faces a huge battle in reducing Guatemala's femicide rates. Since 2000 there have been 5,000 cases of femicide in the country. Guatemala passed a law in 2008 that formally recognizes femicide as a crime within its own right, covering both physical and psychological elements of abuse to women. However, this has done little to reduce impunity rates, with a reported 98 per cent of criminals in femicide cases walking free. One problem the special task force may have to consider is the high rate of femicides which result from domestic violence, which frequently receives fewer attention and resources compared to other types of crimes. For example, a report by the Guatemala Human Rights Commission (GHRC) showed that between January and August 2008, 61 per cent of femicides were the end result of domestic violence. "	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Bolivia VP: US Has Obligation to Fund Anti-Drug Efforts. Responding to a remark made by USAID mission director Wayne Nilsestuen about an upcoming ""overall reduction"" in aid, Bolivia's vice president Alvaro?Garcia Linera said the U.S. has a ""responsibility"" to fight against drug trafficking in the country, and should therefore maintain current levels of aid. According to the Bolivian newspaper La Razon , USAID allocated $50 million to Bolivia this year alone, which was used to fund alternative development projects and efforts to crack down on organized crime. Although Nilsestuen announced that any future reductions in anti-narcotics aid would be the result of the recession, the vice president said any reduction would be a failure of the United States' obligation as a consumer country. ""The fight against drug trafficking is a shared responsibility,"" said Garcia, ""but the burden lies primarily on consumer countries, so the aid should not decrease. It is their obligation and responsibility."" The issue of drug trafficking is particularly sensitive to the Bolivian government, thanks to recent U.S. diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks in which American officials express deep criticism of President Morales' handling of coca production in the country.

Guatemala Sees 3 Bus Drivers Murdered in Single Day. Three bus drivers were shot to death in a single day in Guatemala, illustrating the threat that the country's transport workers are under from criminal groups who demand extortion payments. The first victim, Mario Augusto Salazar, was killed by three gunmen who were traveling as passengers in a bus he was driving between between two towns in southwestern Guatemala. Authorities are investigating whether he was killed for failing to pay extortion fees, reported La Prensa Libre. The other two victims, drivers Dimas Mendez Rodas and Jose Angel Ramos Jimenez, were murdered by gunmen in the province of Jutiapa and in Guatemala City, respectively. Extortion of bus drivers by gangs and violent retribution for those who fail to pay are common in many parts of Latin America. In Medellin, six bus drivers have been killed this year, as the fragmentation of the city's criminal groups means that transport workers are being pressured to make payments to multiple gangs on their routes through the city. In Guatemala, extortion of bus drivers has become so endemic and violent that a 2011 InSight Crime investigation concluded that driving a bus in that country may be one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. According to Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, 1,368 people were murdered on public transport in the country between 2005 and 2011, 780 of whom were drivers. Guatemala City is in the process of replacing its old buses with a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, whose vehicles are more secure and where drivers do not handle cash, in order to cut down on extortion of drivers and reduce violence. According to some sources , as of 2011 there had been no murders, armed robberies, or other violent incidents reported on the system since it opened in 2007, although this had not been confirmed by the authorities. However, there has been opposition from some bus drivers. Earlier this week, the Extraurban Transport Union (Gretexpa) voted to oppose a government proposal to implement a prepaid system on all their buses, on the grounds that it would bring in more stringent regulations in terms of licensing, reported La Prensa Libre .	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
"Sinaloa Cartel Fueling Chicago Murders: Report. The Sinaloa Cartel's control over the Chicago drugs market is driving the city's murder rate, says a Bloomberg report, but in reality such a clear-cut link has yet to be established. A report by Bloomberg describes how Sinaloa leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman has during the last seven years gained control of drug supply and wholesale distribution in the city and a significant part of the Midwest. Around 80 percent of the heroin, cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine going to the Chicago region is Sinaloan, according to the US Drugs Enforcement Administration -- a market worth $3 billion a year. Guzman has such control that he is able to set the prices, according to former city gang leader Harold Ward. The wholesale heroin price has doubled in a decade and his stranglehold is sparking increasingly desperate turf wars between the city's local street-selling gangs. Last year Chicago had 506 murders among a population of 2.7 million, the highest per capita rate among the four biggest US cities. According to University of Chicago research, while overall the murder rate has halved since the city's crack epidemic of the 1990s, in certain poor parts of the city there are actually more homicides today than there were then. Chicago was chosen as a US drugs hub by the Sinaloa because of its key location, said Bloomberg, ""where highways and rail lines converge and then fan across the Midwest."" Where before Guzman relied on local gang leaders, now he has top-level Sinaloa operatives permanently stationed in Chicago, according to retired detective and Chicago Crime Commission vice-president Art Bilek. Unemployment and poor education has also provided a ready supply of young salesmen. Warnings about Latin American cartels taking over the United States must always be viewed with a degree of caution, as so many reports of encroachment and spillover violence have now been discredited. Alejandro Hope, a security analyst and former Mexican intelligence official told Bloomberg, ""It's easier to sell the need for a bump in your budget if you speak about evil Mexicans than if you present a complex web of gangs."" Exaggerating the threat in the hopes of budget increases was also described by law enforcement officials across the US interviewed by the Washington Post earlier this year. While certainly true that the Sinaloa Cartle is operating in Chicago and supplying the market, a direct causal link between the group's presence and methods and the city's murder rate is much less clear."	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Florida Judge Releases El Salvador Businessmans Aircraft. A Florida civil court judge has ordered the return of several aircraft to prominent El Salvador businessman Enrique Rais after the Martin County sheriff dropped the case calling for their forfeiture. Florida's 19 th Circuit Judge Barbara Bronis closed the case on June 6 and ordered the three planes and a helicopter be returned to Rais. The judge had in an earlier ruling found probable cause for forfeiture of the aircraft based on the sheriff's investigation that alleged they were illegally registered in the United States. The sheriff's petition said that drug detection dogs had raised suspicions about the aircraft. ""All charges have been withdrawn today, after the review of all the information and the lab reports which 100 percent confirmed that there never were any drug traces, or traces of any other illicit substance in the aircrafts,"" Rais was quoted as saying on La Pagina website. Sources close to federal authorities in the United States, who spoke on condition of anonymity citing an ongoing investigation, told InSight Crime that no testing was conducted beyond that carried out by the Sheriff's K-9 unit. The sources added that Rais continues to be a person of interest for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Some of the same aircraft are also at the center of an investigation by El Salvador's ethics tribunal (Tribunal de Etica Gubernamental). The tribunal is looking into former Attorney General Luis Martinez's use of the aircraft at a time when Rais was being sued for administrative fraud. The fraud case involves a suit filed by two of Rais's former business partners, both Canadian, in a public-private waste management enterprise. Rais's former partners claim he defrauded them of $25 million dollars and Rais has countersued, alleging that he is the target of extortion. One of Rais' former advisors, the lawyer Mario Calderon, was jailed in El Salvador when Martinez was attorney general. Calderon had started working with the Canadians when Martinez initiated three separate cases against him. El Salvador's Supreme Court recently ruled Calderon's detention illegal."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"50-Year Crime Family Feud Behind Killings in Rural Brazil. A conflict in Brazil's northeast, where security forces launched an operation to quell a violent feud between criminal dynasties, is a reminder that in some rural parts of the country, state presence is as weak and crime as rampant as in urban favelas. On October 12, two gunmen on a motorcycle tried to kill a municipal prison director in the northeast state of Paraiba , firing 11 shots at his car. The attack came just 15 days after police announced a new security offensive, known as ""Operation Blood Ties,"" to stop a wave of killings linked to an ongoing feud between three crime families. The conflict is reportedly responsible for at least 95 murders in Paraiba so far this year, 31 of those police officers. Some 1,200 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, Paraiba is a state best known for its ranching economy and its history of ""cangaceiros"" -- bandits who preyed on rich landowners. Similarly to Colombian cattle-ranching departments like Caqueta, where rule of law is weak and local politics are based on an intricate network of family loyalties, Paraiba is at the periphery of Brazil both in terms of geography and attention from the national government. The region is also among Brazil's most violent. Out of 27 states, Paraiba has third highest rate of firearm-related homicides. But the ongoing insecurity in Paraiba, which security officials have said could have roots in disputes over contraband and drug trafficking routes, calls into question Brazil's ability to enforce the rule of law even in the most forgotten departments. This is especially pertinent as Brazil continues its push to increase its global clout, both on the world stage and as a regional leader in Latin America. Paraiba's police say three families are responsible for the targeted killings seen so far this year. The ones who appear to be most involved in organized crime are the Oliveiras, based in two of Paraiba's larger cities, Patos and Catole do Rocha. According to Paraiba's security secretary , the Oliveiras work with the organization of Law Kin Chong, whom the Federal Police have described as the biggest contraband runner in the country. The Oliveiras reportedly smuggle pirated goods from Paraguay, which are then distributed by Chong in major cities like Sao Paulo. The regional secretary of security told newspaper Jornal Correio de Paraiba that the Oliveiras are also reportedly involved in drug trafficking, and have a faction of their operations based in Sao Paulo, including a network of hitmen. The conflict between the Oliveiras and two other prominent Paraiba families, the Veras and the Suassanas, may have originally arisen as a dispute over control of traditional contraband networks. Local politicians have said the conflict has been running for 50 years now, and may have begun as a fight over political power involving the Suassanas and another family, the Mayas. The feud reignated in the 1990s, and a surge of killings saw many members of the three families -- in-laws, cousins , nephews and brothers -- shot dead. Now, the ongoing conflict appears to be locked in a cycle of revenge killings, motivated primarily by family ties. However, it is possible that there is another, more strategic objective behind the violence: gaining control of the Oliveiras' contraband networks. Investigations in Paraiba have also reportedly shown that the Oliveiras may have had some associates killed in order to collect the life insurance, worth up to $200,000 in some cases. This may have also played a role in fueling the conflict, if the Oliveiras then blamed the killings on their rivals. The police offensive meant to stem the violence has seen the arrest of 17 suspects so far , including a woman described as the matriach of the Oliveiras and the mastermind behind many of the murders. But the recent assassination attempt against Estenio Dantas, the director of Paraiba's prison system, may be one indication that the feuding families intend to begin targeting state officials, not just each other. According to Dantas , at least two police commanders and two judges based in Patos and Catole do Rocha have also received death threats. In one effort to improve security, Paraiba's government is reportedly considering installing community policing units , modeled after the UPP in Rio de Janeiro , in the state's capital city. In Paraiba's more rural outposts, however, for now the responsibility lies with the 130 police responsible for carrying out ""Operation Blood Ties."" If the short-term objective is to quell the feud between Paraiba's three warring families, the long-term goal must be break up the contraband networks which allow groups like the Oliveiras to fund themselves. Brazil has primarily promoted Rio de Janeiro's UPP program as an example for how the country is improving security in time for Rio's hosting of the 2016 Olympics and the 2014 World Cup. But while the focus on urban crime is an understandable priority, so long as the homicide rates in Brazil's rural departments remain so high, and the contraband business so prosperous, Brazil can hardly speak of having achieved a model security community. The current feud raging in far-off Paraiba is but one reminder that in many pockets of the country, the government is having a tough time properly containing the threats of violence, contraband and the drug trade.

"Honduras Seizes 100,000 Gallons in Contraband Fuel. A ship carrying some 110,000 gallons of contraband fuel, allegedly originating in Venezuela , was intercepted by Honduran naval forces, raising the question of whether a smuggling operation is indeed moving contraband fuel between the two countries. As newspaper Proceso reports , the Honduran Navy intercepted the ship, named the ""Island Lady,"" on February 16 in the Caribbean Sea near Guanaja Island, about 40 miles off the Honduran coast. The ship was reportedly carrying diesel and gasoline, both of which are cheap and abundant in Venezuela. A Naval spokesperson said that the fuel was meant for an ""important"" person in Honduras, without providing further details. Nor did the security forces release the name of the owner of the ship. Authorities also said that the exact quantity of contraband fuel onboard the ship is not known at this time. The 14 Honduran crew members were detained and are facing a pending investigation. It would be unsurprising if the fuel did turn out to originate in Venezuela, which has some of the cheapest fuel in the world, averaging nine cents per gallon of premium gasoline. One question is whether the fuel was actually transported from Venezuela to Honduras, over 1,000 miles of ocean. In spite of this long distance, arguably smugglers would still have the economic incentive to make the trip, given the low prices of fuel in Venezuela and the profits that the contraband product would bring in Honduras. This would especially hold true as the Honduran government just announced a hike in fuel prices. Mexico is the traditional source of contraband fuel in Honduras. Last year, reports emerged stating that the Mexican Navy seized nearly 80,000 gallons of stolen diesel fuel belonging to the Zetas , destined for Honduras. Mexican criminal organizations are blamed for stealing thousands of gallons of gasoline per hour from state oil company Pemex, although it is unclear how much of this stolen fuel stays inside Mexico and how much is exported to other countries.

"Viagras Criminal Group Disguised as Vigilantes in Mexico. An intelligence report has revealed that the armed group the Viagras, which forms part of Mexico's government-backed vigilante force, is actually a criminal enterprise operating under the facade of the self-defense movement, highlighting how authorities are unwittingly legitimizing criminal groups. According to an intelligence report from Mexico's national security cabinet accessed by Milenio , the Viagras are an armed group involved in drug trafficking as part of a criminal collective in Michoacan state known as the H-3 Cartel. The report states that the Viagras have strong ties to Familia Michoacana founder Jesus Mendez, alias ""El Chango,"" and worked for his criminal group before joining forces with the Knights Templar cartel. The Viagras have since moved on to ally themselves with the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG), reported Milenio. In addition, the intelligence report states that the Viagras engage in hired assassinations, extortion, and marijuana and synthetic drug trafficking. The Viagra's leaders have met with Knights Templar leader Servando Gomez, alias ""La Tuta,"" on numerous occasions to coordinate extortions targeting ranchers and lime farmers, according to the report. This is not the first time suspicions have been raised about the Viagras, who according to Milenio form part of the state-backed Rural Defense Force launched in May 2014. However, whereas the group previously appeared to land somewhere in the middle of the continuum between self-defense force and criminal group, the security cabinet intelligence report plants the Viagras squarely on the side of drug traffickers. Considering the legitimacy granted to the Viagras by their incorporation into the Rural Defense Force, it is unsurprising that the criminal group would want to join a government sanctioned self-defense unit. The vigilante designation has likely helped the criminal organization win the support of the local population as well as increase their territorial control, which are both major advantages for a drug trafficking group. Their case indicates that the government's policy towards vigilantes could be serving to strengthen some pre-existing criminal organizations -- or self-defense groups that have since criminalized -- in Michoacan. Mexico's legitimization of shady armed groups draws parallels to Colombia's establishment of vigilante groups in the mid-1990s that would later turn into paramilitary organizations, as well as the legalization of the ""Rondas Campesinas"" in Peru during the 1980s to combat the Shining Path guerrillas. Both groups committed human rights violations while under the auspices of their respective governments. According to Milenio, the Viagras were founded by the Sierra Santana brothers in Buenavista Tomatlan, Michoacan and are led by Carlos Sierra Santana, alias ""El Viagra,"" with his brother Nicolas Sierra Santana, alias ""El Coruco,"" serving as the group's spokesman."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Just the Facts: In Troubled Tumaco, Little Progress. A group of U.S. and Colombian think tanks found little progress in Tumaco, a region on Colombia 's Pacific coast that is one of the flagship locations for a plan to bring government presence to neglected parts of the country. The group's report is reproduced in full below: During the last week of April a group from the Washington Office on Latin America ( WOLA , Washington), the Center for International Policy ( CIP , Washington), Asociacion MINGA (Bogota), and the Institute for Development and Peace Studies ( INDEPAZ , Bogota) traveled to Tumaco, on the Pacific coast of Colombia's far southwest, near the border with Ecuador. With a population of 180,000 and a land area about equal to Rhode Island, the city and surrounding municipality (county) of Tumaco make up one of Colombia's most troubled and violent territories. Every year, Tumaco is listed as Colombia's number-one or number-two municipality for the cultivation of coca, the crop used to make cocaine (the country has 1,100 municipalities). It also has one of the country's highest murder rates -- well over 100 homicides per 100,000 residents -- and a strong guerrilla and paramilitary-group presence. We traveled to Tumaco because it is also one of about 14 sites chosen for a U.S.-supported military and development aid program that is, in a way, the successor to ""Plan Colombia."" Known as ""Consolidation"" or ""Integrated Action,"" this large-scale program purports to introduce a functioning government in long-neglected territories. Our four organizations are carrying out a joint project to monitor this program. Though its design indicates that learning has taken place since Plan Colombia's launch in 2000, we have concerns about Consolidation: the role of the military, coordination between government bodies, consultation with communities, effects on land tenure, and several others. In each of the chosen zones, the Consolidation strategy begins with offensive military operations to establish ""security conditions."" Then, it aims quickly to bring in the rest of the government to provide basic services in a phased, coordinated way. According to the Consolidation program's documents, the desired end state is the military's near-total pullout from the zone, leaving behind a functioning government, greatly reduced violence, the absence of armed groups, and the elimination of drug production. Though we were looking at it in Tumaco, the United States has invested most heavily in Consolidation elsewhere in Colombia since the program began, in its current form, in 2007. A December 2009 report by the Center for International Policy, "" After Plan Colombia ,"" looks at Consolidation in two of those zones of greater investment: the La Macarena region south of Bogota, and the Montes de Maria region near the Caribbean coast. U.S. officials tell us that the program is advancing with Washington's support in the southern part of Tolima department, west of Bogota, but we have not yet visited that zone. Though it appears in the list of consolidation zones and is clearly a priority because of drug production, we hadn't heard as much about how the program was proceeding in Tumaco. We chose to visit the city, though, because of a close tie to U.S. policy: its crisis of violence and drug-trafficking owes in part to Plan Colombia's unintended consequences. In 2000, a $1.3 billion aid package from the United States, the first outlay of funds for Plan Colombia, allowed a dramatic expansion of aerial herbicide fumigation in the department of Putumayo, about 250 miles east of Tumaco, bordering Tumaco's home department of Narino. At the time, Putumayo was Colombia's largest producer of coca. Plan Colombia extended into Putumayo a huge aerial herbicide fumigation program. U.S. planners did not accompany this spraying program with anywhere near enough alternative development assistance for Putumayo's farmers. In fact, Plan Colombia lacked any real attempt to establish a permanent civilian government presence there; it continues to be weak in Putumayo. Fumigation planes share the tarmac at Tumaco's airport. As a result, many Putumayans whose crops were sprayed and found themselves with no economic options migrated to the Pacific coast, particularly Tumaco. The town of Llorente, in the eastern part of Tumaco municipality, is occasionally called "" Putumayito "" because of the large number of Putumayan migrants. The displacement of coca, and coca growers, to Putumayo upset the social order in what was then one of Colombia's most forgotten corners. Tumaco's mostly Afro-Colombian population lives in near-total isolation from the rest of the country, engaging in subsistence agriculture or growing basic cash crops like coconuts, cacao, or plantains. Lining the many rivers flowing into the Pacific are communities settled by freed and escaped slaves, whose descendants were excluded and held apart from Colombia's national life. In 1993, two years after Colombia approved a progressive new constitution, a new law -- Law 70 -- recognized the landholdings of these and hundreds of other Afro-Colombian communities in the country's isolated, undeveloped, densely jungled Pacific lowlands. These landholdings, known as Community Councils, are held in common. Titled collectively, they make up a significant percentage of Tumaco's land area. A smaller but significant amount of land is in the hands of indigenous communities. This major advance in recognition of their property rights, unfortunately, came at the same time that these communities entered into greater contact with the outside world. Instead of government officials offering security, justice and basic services, though, ""contact"" meant encounters with narco-traffickers and large landowners, who were often the same people. The narco-traffickers were attracted by Tumaco's strategic value. Its rivers have proven to be ideal corridors for taking shipments of drugs to the Pacific Ocean -- directly or through Ecuador -- and on to Mexico , Central America, and the United States. Its dense jungles provide cover for laboratories to make cocaine. Its coastal mangrove estuaries provide innumerable hiding spots for boats transshipping drugs. (They also hide "" semi-submersibles :"" homemade submarines, usually pulled behind a boat, that carry tons of cocaine at a time and are difficult to detect.) As coca cultivation migrated to Tumaco during the early 2000s, the municipality became a center of cocaine cultivation, production, and transshipment -- one of few territories where all phases of the cocaine production process take place simultaneously. For their part, large landowners saw vast expanses of well-watered, undeveloped land ideal for large-scale, capital-intensive agribusiness. These include profitable products like African oil palm and cattle ranching. The oil palm -- used increasingly in biofuels -- experienced a boom during the mid-2000s, along with massive land purchases, until a blight destroyed most of Tumaco's crop. While landowners began encroaching on the Community Councils' territories, the profitable coca trade proved to be a temptation to many of the Councils' residents. UNODC has found ( PDF page 62) coca-growers earning a net income of perhaps $10-12 per day -- about double the minimum wage in Colombia's formal economy, and better than most cash crops offer. Its product, a highly portable paste that traffickers later refine into cocaine, is far easier to market in roadless territories. With the coca boom, however, came a far greater presence of illegal armed groups whose presence in Tumaco had been only sporadic before. In fact, while economics enticed some to grow coca, many others have been forced to plant the crop by the guerrillas or paramilitaries who held sway in their territories. The FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) and ELN (National Liberation Army) guerrilla groups started out raising funds to buy guns by taxing coca growers, but soon went on to participate in production and trafficking. They built up their presence in the municipality during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Guerrillas, especially the FARC's 29th Front, began killing community leaders whom they viewed as threats to their dominion, extorted funds from business owners, and controlled communities' movements along the rivers. The guerrillas had little competition from Colombia's state, which was barely present in Tumaco beyond a few military and police posts and a badly corrupt municipal government. Government representatives spent very little time outside the county seat, leaving the forgotten communities along the rivers at the armed groups' mercy. The drug trade's wealth then attracted an illegal armed group from the other side: the pro-government, drug funded paramilitary network known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC. The AUC's so-called Liberators of the South Bloc, headed by Guillermo Perez Alzate , who went by the name ""Pablo Sevillano,"" moved into the zone after 2000. As in other zones of guerrilla influence, the newly arrived paramilitaries carried out a brutal wave of hundreds of extrajudicial killings and massacres of those they believed to be guerrilla collaborators. The violence displaced tens of thousands of people to Tumaco's town center and to cities elsewhere in the country, while thousands more crossed the border into Ecuador. For their part, Colombia's security forces combated ""Pablo Sevillano's"" men only on the rarest of occasions. After pushing the coca economy from Putumayo, Plan Colombia followed the coca crops to Tumaco. The U.S. and Colombian governments' initial response to Tumaco's drug and violence crisis was not to strengthen the state's presence in the municipality. Instead, Plan Colombia offered a sharp increase in aerial herbicide fumigation over the Community Councils' collectively held lands. Narino, led by Tumaco, has been by far the most fumigated of Colombia's 32 departments during the past ten years. The fumigation came with alternative development programs, financed by USAID and other donors. These covered only a small portion of the affected communities, though, and could do little in a context of statelessness, lack of transportation, uncertain land tenure, and out-of-control violence. Worse, the U.S.-backed Colombian National Police fumigation program has insisted on spraying any coca plants it detects, meaning that alternative development projects funded by USAID have routinely been sprayed merely because of the proximity of coca plants. Despite large-scale fumigation, coca growing has proved stubborn in Tumaco. This is largely a result of the state's absence from most of the territory and the lack of other economic alternatives for growers. So when the U.S. and Colombian governments begin pursuing Consolidation -- a strategy that explicitly seeks to build up the government's on-the-ground presence -- Tumaco appeared to be a prime candidate. Despite that, our attempt to evaluate Consolidation's performance in Tumaco was more challenging than we expected. The main problem was that nobody in the municipality seemed to know what we were talking about, even though Consolidation had officially been functioning and present in Tumaco since 2008. In other parts of the country, Consolidation is also often known as CCAI, after the name of the agency in the Colombian Presidency (Center for the Coordination of Integrated Action) that manages it. In Tumaco, however, when we asked civil society leaders about the CCAI (pronounced ""Say-Kigh""), they responded, ""What kind of fruit is that?"" A top municipal government official told us of having received e-mail about the program and hearing nothing since, until the CCAI held a meeting in early April. We paid a visit to the CCAI headquarters for Tumaco: it is a room with desks, computer equipment and maps at a beachside hotel complex heavily used by police and contractors involved with coca-eradication missions. The office is meant to coordinate all government agencies' activities to establish a presence in the zone; the Tumaco ""coordination center,"" however, appeared to have only a handful of staff and a very small administrative footprint. The CCAI ""Coordination Center"" in Tumaco Unlike La Macarena -- a zone where the United States has helped finance hundreds of millions of dollars in military offensives and development projects -- Tumaco has seen very little investment in the Consolidation framework. Instead, the activities the United States is actually paying for in Tumaco look more like the same Plan Colombia programs of a decade ago. As in Putumayo circa 2002, fumigation is massive, while alternative development projects lag behind in stateless, insecure areas. Building up a civilian, institutional state presence on the ground is still a faraway goal toward which little progress is notable, even in the town center. When fumigation eliminates growers' legal crops or food crops, food security assistance is rarely available. Local human rights and development workers affirmed that a significant portion of those who displace from Tumaco's Afro Colombian communities today are fleeing repeated fumigation. Why has ""Consolidation"" stumbled at the starting gate in Tumaco? The main reason is resources. Its far-flung geography makes Tumaco very hard to govern, and its high poverty and indigence rates mean that needs are greater. A proper Consolidation program in Tumaco would require an immense amount of funding, a large multiple of what USAID, other donors and the Colombian treasury are currently providing. The United States has not planned to invest such resources in Tumaco -- a great shame considering the amount that the United States has invested in forced eradication -- and Colombia's government has done little to fill the gap. To date, the significant exception appears to be a program begun by the Narino governor's office called ""Si Se Puede"" (Yes We Can). This is a small program -- the governor's office, in the hands of a leftist opposition party under Governor Antonio Navarro Wolff, a former leader of the disbanded M-19 guerrillas -- is strapped for cash and heavily indebted. Nonetheless, the Si Se Puede program did answer positively to a request for development financing from the leaders of one Afro-Colombian Community Council in Tumaco: the community of Rescate-Las Varas. Here, in exchange for the community's willingness to eradicate their own coca, the government is offering assistance with USAID support. Farmers are getting food-security aid as they switch to legal cash craps like cacao, coconuts, managed forestry, fish farming and others. The successful eradication of most coca in Las Varas is leading local officials to consider the community a model. Local coordinators of the CCAI in Tumaco say they plan to work with the Las Varas community to guarantee further investment and to extend the model elsewhere in Tumaco. This expectation to provide future support was the main concrete example we heard of the Consolidation program's activity in Tumaco. As Governor Navarro (and likely his party) leave office at the end of this year, the sustainability of the government's commitment to Las Varas is in question. Consolidation may have to pick up where ""Si Se Puede"" left off. This may be far more difficult than it sounds. The community's trust in the government remains fragile, and relationships forged with the governor's office may not be easily transferrable to a new entity. Meanwhile the Las Varas community faces friction with other Community Councils uncomfortable with its embrace of the state or unhappy that they are not receiving similar investment. The Consolidation program is proceeding haltingly in conditions that continue to be among the least secure in the country. Indeed, the Las Varas community has suffered the death of six or seven village leaders (depending on whether or not some were accidents or homicides) as a result of their choice to abandon coca and work with the state. The FARC guerrillas remain very active in Tumaco and neighboring municipalities, participating in the drug trade, targeting local leaders, particularly indigenous leaders, attacking military and police targets, and making travel difficult on the few existing secondary and tertiary roads. Further downriver and along the coast itself, one finds the heirs of the AUC paramilitary group, which disbanded officially in 2006. (Pablo Sevillano, the head of the AUC's Liberators of the South Bloc, is now in a U.S. prison serving time for drug trafficking.) Former mid-level AUC commanders now control smaller groups that exist mainly for the drug trade, but still regularly threaten local leaders and engage in land theft. These so-called ""emerging criminal groups"" are popping up all over the country. Many reportedly have little to fear from the police and military, though this is usually a result of corruption, not alliance. Some in fact do drug business with the FARC guerrillas, and often fight each other for territory. In Tumaco, the ""new"" paramilitary group that appears to have wrested control from the others is called Los Rastrojos (the word refers to what is left behind after a harvest), which is one of the most powerful of the new groups nationwide. The Rastrojos now control most riverine traffic in coastal Tumaco, especially the boatloads of cocaine that continue to leave the zone. The FARC, however, do continue to control some rivers and corridors, and joint guerrilla-paramilitary drug shipments have been detected. The security situation in Tumaco remains dire. Most people we talked to, regardless of their social sector, were reluctant to talk at length about the perpetrators of the zone's violence and narcotrafficking. Some authorities, however, said that the number of incidents of murder and other violent crime had dropped since the middle of last year; this, they suspect, may be a result of the Rastrojos' defeat of their paramilitary rivals and assumption of greater territorial control. Tumaco's trafficking routes may be somewhat less contested than before, and the FARC -- with the exception of some recent kidnapping-for-ransom attempts in the city center -- are largely forced to operate upriver, further from the coast. The government response to the Rastrojos remains unclear. As in other parts of the country, the armed forces tend to consider them primarily to be a police responsibility. Colombia's police forces, however, are meant to operate in urban areas (with the exception of small, specialized units like Carabineros or Junglas). When they operate in rural zones, as they usually do, the Rastrojos end up in a ""doughnut hole"" of security-force responsibility: they are in the jurisdiction of army and marine units who consider them primarily to be a police issue. This is compounded by a chronic lack of coordination between the armed forces and police. Amid this panorama of violence and narco-trafficking, the Consolidation or Integrated Action effort has barely begun. Tumaco's challenges make it difficult to determine where to start, especially when U.S. and Colombian government funding hasn't been generous. The Colombian government is currently evaluating or rethinking the national Consolidation effort. When the government announces the results of this rethinking -- probably in June -- these will include a reduction in the number of ""Consolidation"" zones from the current 14. Several zones will see their CCAI offices close, and promises of state presence and investment will go unfulfilled. The remaining zones, however, will presumably see far greater investment than before. It is likely that Tumaco will remain in the national Consolidation scheme. If so, perhaps a year or two from now Tumaco's local leaders will have heard and seen enough of Consolidation to be able to evaluate the program and gauge its impact on their communities -- which to date has been nearly zero.

"Cop-Killer Guns Now Available in Medellin, Thanks to Miami Connection. The Five-seven semi-automatic pistol, capable of piercing body armor, is already a favored weapon of the Mexican cartels. Now there are signs that this ""cop killer"" gun has found its way into the Colombian black market. A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has described the Five-seven as "" the weapon of choice "" for Mexico's criminal organizations. The weapon first gained the attention of Mexico law enforcement after it was used during attacks against police officers in Mexico City in 2007. With an estimated $5,000 value on Mexico's black market , it is colloquially known as a ""mata-policia,"" or cop killer. It is believed to make its way into Mexico primarily from the country's northern neighbor, as it available for purchase by civilians in some US gun stores. As Medellin-based newspaper El Colombiano reports , cartridge casings from the gun have appeared in several crime scenes in Medellin, indication that gun traffickers have managed to import the pistol into Colombia. The gun is an increasingly popular item among the city mafia, known as the Oficina de Envigado. Most notably, the Five-seven was used during a nightclub massacre in July 2010 , which left eight people dead. During a routine house raid in a Medellin neighborhood last January, police reported finding two Five-seven pistols alongside a stash of marijuana and coca base, watched over by a 19-year-old guard. The other surprising find during the routine raid was a FN PS90 compact assault rifle, said to belong to a street gang loyal to Medellin mafia boss Erick Vargas Cardenas, alias "" Sebastian ."" Like the Five-seven, the automatic military version of the rifle was initially developed by NATO in the early 90s, in order to provide highly powerful and adaptable weapons for special forces and law enforcement. The subautomatic PS90 was released in 2005, and is available for civilian purchase in the US. Just as criminal groups were attracted to the Five-seven's ability to penetrate body armor, the PS90 also provides several advantages: small and compact, it is ideal for urban warfare and requires little maintenance. With both the Five-seven and the PS90 now apparently available in Medellin, it is possible that the city's various warring groups could seek to turn the tide in their favor by stocking up on ""cop-killers,"" still not used by Colombian police. Last year rival gang the Urabenos was able to make inroads in Medellin's barrios, thanks to their stockpiles of high-power weaponry like AK-47s and M-16s. For gangs looking to replicate the Urabenos' success, it is possible that the Five-seven and PS90 could become some of the most sought-after items in the black market. Helping the mystique of these weapons is their popularity among the most violent figures in Colombia's underworld. This includes paramilitary warlord Miguel Angel Mejia Munera, and slain Urabenos leader Juan de Dios Usuga, alias "" Giovanni ,"" both of whom were users of the PS90 and the Five-seven, respectively. If Colombian gangs are ready to buy greater numbers of ""cop-killers"" from gun traffickers, those best poised to profit may be those who work the Medellin-Miami connection. According to El Colombiano, the PS90 confiscated by Medellin police in January was traced back to a Miami gun store, Miami Police Supply. By tracing the weapon's serial number, authorities were able to ascertain that it was purchased from the Miami store November 20, 2010. The two Five-sevens seized during the same raid were also traced back to Miami Police Supply, purchased on two separate days in September 2011. The buyers may be US citizens whom Colombian gun traffickers pay to purchase the weapons on their behalf, the El Colombiano report says. After the weapons are purchased in Miami, they are sent to Colombia, sometimes disassembled and hidden among auto parts or other common mechanical household items. Police say that they believe the weapons enter Medellin by land from the Uraba region, bordering the Caribbean sea, El Colombiano reports. Gun traffickers have a solid economic incentive to handle ""cop-killer"" weapons. There is also good reason to base their operations in Miami, where there is a large Colombian population, and where a Five-seven costs between $855 to $1,050 dollars. In the Colombian underworld, the same weapon may sell for up to $8,490, police told El Colombiano. Medellin's gangs are eager to obtain a product which the Miami-Medellin connection seems prepared to supply, looking for any advantage over their rivals. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Honduran Criminal Assets Frozen in Crippled Seizure System. Honduran authorities have been unable to unchain hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods seized from criminals during the last three years, according to a media investigation. Inquiries by newspaper La Prensa established that operations by anti-narcotics officers, special investigators, police and prosecutors had seized 153 properties, 266 cars and more than $5 million during 2010, 2011 and 2012, with total assets apprehended estimated to be worth more than $500 million. However, the state is unable to access any of the money, said the newspaper, as asset transfers must be authorized by a judge, and, of the 36 orders filed during this period, all are still pending. The severe obstacles in the asset seizure system and the apparent inefficiency of the seizure agency is another troubling sign of the endemic corruption in Honduras. La Prensa's report does not explain what's behind the backlog, but criminals have deeply penetrated Honduras' judicial system. The situation has echoes of the scandal that engulfed the now-dismantled Colombian Drug Enforcement Agency (DNE), which was taken over by the Colombian government in 2010. The discovery of irregularities in the DNE's handling of confiscated assets led to accusations of widespread high-level corruption and the investigation of 14 politicians. In one instance of reported wrongdoing, the DNE valued a ranch at around $11,000 when it was actually worth more than $2.5 million. The ranch was leased out by DNE directors to business owners who used it to raise cattle, El Tiempo reported. According to statements obtained by radio station Caracol and reported by newspaper El Tiempo , the ex-director of the DNE, Carlos Albornoz, would privately see politicians every Wednesday and created a committee to assign them seized assets. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"US Investigating Criminal Ties of Dozens of Honduras Elites: Report. Nearly three dozen mayors, congressmen, judges, military officials and police officers in Honduras are reportedly being investigated for their connections to a drug cartel, a potentially explosive probe that could help expose the deep links between elites and organized crime in the country. According to an anonymous source consulted by La Prensa , Honduran and US intelligence officers are investigating 35 individuals, including eight mayors, nine congressional representatives, two judges, four active military officials, three businessmen and an unidentified number of police officers. The names of the suspects were not released in order to avoid interfering in the ongoing probe, reported La Prensa. The individuals are suspected of working with the Atlantic Cartel, a criminal organization based in the western departments of Copan and Ocotepeque where the powerful Valle Valle drug clan once operated, according to the source. The source also said the Atlantic Cartel has ""important alliances"" with the AA Cartel, which is allegedly run by Alexander Ardon, the former mayor of El Paraiso, Copan. The US Embassy in Honduras announced on October 7 that the alleged leader of the cartel, Wilter Neptaly Blanco Ruiz, is under investigation for drug trafficking and corruption alongside seven other suspects -- including Carlos Alberto Maradiaga Izaguirre, an official with the Honduran Armed Forces. The embassy followed that up with an October 10 declaration that Santos Rodriguez Orellana, a captain in the Honduran Armed Forces, was under investigation for similar charges. The Honduran Armed Forces announced shortly thereafter that the two captains under investigation had been suspended. Maradiaga Izaguirre has denied maintaining links to organized crime. Acccording to La Prensa, the investigation intensified following a recent attack against several US anti-drug agents during a bilateral security operation in San Pedro Sula. The officials were driving in an armored car when it came under heavy fire from individuals suspected of belonging to the Atlantic Cartel. (See La Prensa's photo below) Investigators have reportedly nicknamed the group of almost three dozen suspects ""The Pirates of the Caribbean,"" for their ability to skirt maritime and aerial controls. According to an intelligence report, one of the members of the armed forces under investigation is suspected of manipulating the country's radar system, which monitors the movement of drug planes. Five Honduran police officers who were extradited to the United States in July on drug and arms trafficking charges have provided information related to the case to US authorities, according to La Prensa's source. Taken together, La Prensa's report and the US Embassy's statements paint a frightening picture of the depths of corruption in Honduras. While the newspaper's report has yet to be confirmed, it is unlikely that the embassy would have made its recent pronouncements without credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing. ""They must have irrefutable evidence and have given the names [of the suspects] for reasons that we don't know,"" said Julieta Castellanos, director of the National Autonomous University of Honduras. The reports may also be a sign that the US government's patience with its Honduran counterparts is waning. The embassy called for a thorough investigation into the murder of prominent activist Berta Caceres, and welcomed the arrests of four suspects in May. But in a bizarre and embarrasing twist, reports surfaced in early October that the case file for the activist's murder had been stolen. Two of the supects are connected to a company that is building a dam that Caceres was protesting, and many believe higher-level government and company officials are complicit in the murder. Other indications of deep-seated elite corruption in Honduras came to the fore last year following the arrest in Miami of Yankel Rosenthal, the scion of one of Honduras's wealthiest and most politically connected families. The family is suspected of illicit dealings with the Cachiros drug trafficking organization. And in April, the New York Times released official documents implicating 25 Honduran police officers, including two former national police directors, in the 2009 murder of the country's anti-drug czar. The officers are now being investigated for potentially working with the Atlantic Cartel and Blanco Ruiz, who allegedly ordered the hit on the anti-drug chief. But the documents suggest a systematic cover-up of the crimes that lasted for years, the US newspaper wrote at the time. ""There was a pact of silence,"" the Honduran journalist Thelma Mejia told the Times. Honduran authorities seized over 140 properties belonging to Blanco Ruiz in 2015, but he is believed to still be operating in the Mosquitia region of the country's northeastern coast. For now, La Prensa's report and the embassy's statements raise more questions than they answer. But the ongoing investigations could peel back yet another layer of high-level corruption in a country that continues to be beset by revelations of nefarious activity involving elites and organized crime."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"What Does Mini Lics Not Guilty Plea Mean for Sinaloa Cartel?The son of a former prominent leader of the Sinaloa Cartel has pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking and money laundering charges in the United States, raising questions about his motivations for doing so as the group continues to fragment. On August 7, Damaso Lopez Serrano, alias ""Mini Lic,"" entered a not guilty plea to drug trafficking and money laundering charges in a US court in San Diego, the Associated Press reported. His court appearance came less than two weeks after Mini Lic surrendered to US authorities at the US-Mexico border in California, and just months after the arrest of his father, Damaso Lopez Nunez, alias ""El Lic"" or ""el Licenciado,"" in Mexico City. Nahum Abraham Sicairos Montalvo, alias ""El Quinceanero,"" the pair's alleged financial operator, was also taken into custody by Mexican authorities at the end of July, Milenio reported. In August of 2016, all three were indicted by US authorities in California on drug trafficking and money laundering charges. Licenciado and Mini Lic were also both indicted by US authorities in Virginia in December 2016 for conspiring to distribute drugs for importation. Years before his arrest in 2011, Licenciado was also the focus of another set of charges in Virginia for conspiring to distribute drugs for importation into the United States and commit money laundering. US authorities are seeking Licenciado's extradition, according to an August 7 Justice Department press release. Mini Lic's not guilty plea is not unusual. He is more than likely pleading innocent until he can get a deal worked out with US authorities for a reduced sentence in exchange for his cooperation. In the past, many other drug traffickers and business tycoons around the region have pleaded guilty to lesser charges in exchange for cooperating with authorities. Mike Vigil, a retired Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent, told InSight Crime that Mini Lic's not guilty plea is likely a temporary move until US authorities can see ""what type of cooperation he can provide"" before they enter into a plea agreement. As the godson of former Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, Mini Lic likely knows very well the infrastructure of the cartel, trafficking routes, where the money flows and the inner workings of the group's operations. After El Chapo's arrest, Mini Lic and his father were battling for control over the organization's operations with El Chapo's sons and Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias ""El Mayo."" It is for these reasons that Vigil suggests US authorities will try and use Mini Lic to testify against El Chapo, which may impact the deal he is able to broker with US authorities. ""Mini Lic could provide a lot of knowledge in terms of Guzman's activities because he witnessed a lot of that,"" Vigil told InSight Crime. ""He would be a highly valuable witness."" Still, while some analysts think that Mini Lic's surrender was due to his father's likely negotiations with US authorities, others believe that it is still too early to know the logistics of these possible discussions and their potential consequences for the Sinaloa Cartel."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"In Honduras, Worlds Deadliest City Reports Drop In Crime. The Honduran military and police claim that crime has fallen in San Pedro Sula, currently the most violent city in the world, though they offered vague and differing figures on the supposed security improvement. The military said that crime was down 60 percent in the city's most violent zones, which included Rivera Hernandez, Lomas del Carmen, and the commercial district. However, according to the San Pedro police, crime has only fallen by 10 percent in police district 25, which includes Rivera Hernandez and Lomas del Carmen, reported La Prensa. Neither source specified a time period, nor the type of crimes they were monitoring. The armed forces attributed the decrease in crime to ""Operation Liberty,"" under which troops were deployed to the streets of the country's most violent cities in February. Police officer Oscar Alexis Sosa Martinez credited increased police personnel and 24 hour patrols for the drop he reported in district 25, which has the highest crime rate of any area in the city. Operation Liberty, which was paid for by Honduras' newly implemented security tax , marks the second time that President Porfirio Lobo has deployed the military to fight crime. The armed forces will remain on the streets until January 2014. Lobo's use of the armed forces for domestic security has sparked concerns about the mixing of military and police roles. The reports that crime is down in San Pedro de Sula is a rare piece of good news for Honduras , which, unlike its neighbors in the Northern Triangle, has seen an increase in homicides that made 2012 the country's most violent year on record. San Pedro Sula was reported to be the world's deadliest city for the second year in a row in 2012, with 169 murders per 100,000 inhabitants ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Jamaica Cant Shake Status As US Top Marijuana Provider. A series of marijuana seizures reported over the last few months highlight the magnitude of the drug flow from Jamaica to the United States, as well as the difficulties authorities have in stemming it. During a November 22 operation, six men were arrested after the seizure of 1,000 pounds of marijuana in the port city of Ocho Rios, the Jamaica Gleaner reported. The haul was valued at $4.5 million in the US market. The latest seizure came after two earlier marijuana busts in the same city. In early October, police discovered about 1,000 pounds during a raid. Days before that raid, authorities had captured 500 pounds of marijuana, Caribbean news outlet Loop reported. In August, authorities seized about 7,000 pounds of marijuana in a district neighboring Ocho Rios. The marijuana -- valued at $36 million -- was packaged and appeared ready for export. According to the latest US State Department report on international drug control strategies, most of the marijuana leaving Jamaica is headed for the United States. The recent seizures show that Jamaica's steps to stop large quantities of marijuana continue flowing out of the island have been toothless. Corruption at Jamaica's ports and airports facilitates the movement of drugs, and local organized crime bosses have ties to government officials, ""creating a permissive environment for drug trafficking,"" the State Department report stated. According to the report , factors that have contributed to the island nation becoming one of the hemisphere's key drug trafficking points include the country's location in the Caribbean, its difficult-to-patrol shores, and its role as a container transshipment point. Jamaica's popularity as a tourist destination also facilitates the movement of drugs via small boats and private aircraft, according to the report. The Jamaican and US governments have tried to stop the flow for years with bilateral cooperation agreements. Both countries uphold judicial assistance and extradition treaties in order to facilitate the prosecution of traffickers. The countries also collaborate on enforcement efforts to interdict maritime trafficking. In 2019, the two countries signed a bilateral Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement (CMAA) to formalize the exchange of information between US and Jamaican customs agencies to help control the flow of drugs, arms and other contraband smuggled through legal ports of entry. In 2015, Jamaica decriminalized possession of marijuana, allowing citizens to carry small quantities of 57 grams or less, for personal use. By passing this law, the country hoped not only to reduce micro-trafficking on the island and the burden on the judicial system, but also to encourage the development of a legal marijuana industry that could in turn promote tourism around regulated marijuana consumption."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Over 100 Police in North Mexican City Arrested over Ties to Drug Trade. State authorities detained more than 100 municipal police officers and cadets suspected of corruption and links to organized crime in a single town in the north Mexico state of Nuevo Leon. The operation took place in Linares, where 60 police and 40 cadets were apprehended, while another 18 officers were arrested in the nearby municipality of Villaldama, reports Milenio. According to the mayor of Linares, the suspects include mid-level and senior police officers. El Universal reports that police-issued weapons from the two municipalities will be analyzed to determine if they have been used in any crimes. The operation was carried in response to complaints of extortion and kidnapping for ransom on the part of local business owners and farmers. This weekend's surprise raids on police departments in Linares and Villaldama follow similar operations that took place in the Nuevo Leon towns of Santa Catarina, Apodaca, Pesqueria and Mina last weekend, which resulted in the detention of 157 municipal police (originally reported as 175). Nuevo Leon is currently establishing a new civil police force , set to have some 14,000 members by 2014, which will take on the army's role in fighting organized crime. The state has been hard hit by drug violence, and in one illustration of the chaotic situation of local police, some 28 municipal officers resigned en masse in January after two of their colleagues were found beheaded. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"FARC Run Tungsten Mining in South Colombia. An investigation by Bloomberg has revealed Colombia's FARC guerrillas are heavily involved in the mining and sale of tungsten -- a mineral used in the cars, phones, tablets, computers and televisions manufactured by some of the world's biggest corporations. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) purchase tungsten from indigenous miners and operate their own mine -- known as Tiger Hill -- in the Guainia department near the borders with Venezuela and Brazil, according to Bloomberg. The rebels sell the mineral on to middlemen and mineral companies, who then export it abroad. Over the last five years, records show there have been 40 shipments of tungsten ore out of Colombia by 14 companies, which officials said almost certainly came from Tiger Hill or the wider region. One of the principal exporters is Cali-based Geo Copper, which owns a mine near Tiger Hill that the company CEO claimed was the only legal source of tungsten in the country. However, independent research showed there were no traces of tungsten at the mine, while officials claimed Tiger Hill and its surrounds was the only known source. Companies that have bought Colombian tungsten include BMW, Volkswagen, Ferrari, Porsche, Siemens, Apple, and Samsung. Several of these companies told Bloomberg they were unaware of the FARC's role in the trade and would either halt sourcing from Colombia or initiate their own investigations. Security forces consulted by Bloomberg say they are aware of the illegal operation but can do little about it as the mine is located in an isolated jungle region controlled by the FARC, making military operations difficult and costly. Sourcing minerals can be a murky business. International companies often source from what appear to be respectable national companies, but rarely question where the minerals originally hailed from. When media attention focuses on one region where mineral mining is fuelling conflict -- such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Africa -- companies often withdraw and seek out alternatives. However, as in the case of Colombia, these alternative sources are not always any ""cleaner."" This is not the first time the FARC have been implicated in the trade of conflict minerals. The guerrillas are also believed to be involved in the mining of coltan -- another mineral commonly used in electronic devices -- in Venezuela. Ex-President Hugo Chavez placed a freeze on coltan mining in the country over concerns about its sourcing, however this regulatory vacuum has allowed illegal groups to step in."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Displaced Colombians Win Back Land Stolen by Paramilitaries. In a landmark ruling, a judge ordered land returned to 14 families who were forced from their homes in Uraba, north Colombia, by paramilitaries in the 1990s. Uraba is one of the zones most affected by Colombia's armed conflict. In the 1990s and 2000s, paramilitary forces carried out displacement campaigns against peasants to gain control of the region's natural resources and strategic location on the Caribbean. In 1995, 120 families who lived on land around the municipalities of Turbo and Necocli were told to abandon their homes on the orders of leaders of the paramilitary army United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia ( AUC ). When the farmers fled the area, AUC leaders arranged for proxies to buy these properties using a front company called Tulapa Investments, reported Semana magazine. The government has said that, through force or fraud, at least 41,790 hectares of land in Uraba were illegally acquired. The recent ruling returns land to the original owners that had been purchased using false credentials or forged signatures. Semana magazine called it a historic judgement. As InSight Crime has reported, land restitution is still a dangerous process in Colombia , and many advocates for the reforms have been murdered. Uraba, for example, is still dominated by criminal groups (bandas criminales - BACRIM ) that inherited much of the membership and power base of the AUC, such as the Urabenos. They use Uraba's Caribbean coast to transport drugs out of the country. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Ex-Top Cop Blames Authorities for Sons Murder. Honduras' former police chief has implicated government officials in the murder of his son, who was shot outside a food stand earlier this week. Ricardo Ramirez del Cid, who served as Honduras' top police commander for about six months between 2011 and 2012, said he had information police officials had ordered gang members to kidnap his 17-year-old son, reported the AP. ""The hardest part is that it's the security forces that have done me this great harm the military and the police,"" Ramirez del Cid told newspaper El Heraldo. He accused the police of being largely ""absent"" in terms of investigating the case. Del Cid's son was shot along with his two police bodyguards on February 17 in Tegucigalpa. According to El Heraldo , intelligence sources say the attack was carried out by gang members and was directed by at least three inmates in the national penitentiary. In the interview, Del Cid appeared to imply that he did not believe this theory, stating that the ""mareros"" (gang members) had no interest in harming his son, but were ordered to do so by ""authorities."" Despite Del Cid's insistence during the El Heraldo interview that he ""already knows"" who was behind his son's murder, it is doubtful he is able to see the case objectively. It is true that Honduras' widely corrupt police force are well-known for participating in crimes themselves. In one noteworthy 2011 case, police officers murdered the son of the leader of Honduras' largest university, Julieta Castellanos. The killing happened while Del Cid commanded the force, and arguably played a role in why he was later replaced with controversial commander Juan Carlos Bonilla. It remains to be seen whether the murder of Del Cid's son will increase pressure on the government to move forward more quickly with police reform, as happened with the Castellanos case. During his time as Honduras' top cop, Del Cid was not a strident voice for reform: as blog Honduras Culture and Politics points out , he is among a group of high-ranking police officers who have failed to fully collaborate with police clean-up efforts."	0	1	0	1	0	0	0
"Perus Humala Calls for Closer Anti-Drug Cooperation with US. Peru's President Ollanta Humala has called for heightened counternarcotics cooperation with the U.S., requesting a host of new technology to assist his government in the struggle against drug trafficking. After delivering a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in which he called on the U.S. to reconsider its immigration policies, Humala told journalists in New York that he hopes to improve bilateral ties between the two governments on drug policy. ""That is our interest, qualitatively superior cooperation with the U.S. in the fight against this scourge,"" he said. Specifically, he highlighted the need for better equipment for the country's drug enforcement officers, saying that satellite technology and other types of scanners were needed to locate illicit coca crops in remote regions like the Apurimac and Ene River Valley (known as the VRAE). At the same time, Humala said that his government needed to do more to present economic alternatives to coca cultivation in the poorest parts of the country, where for many farmers many it is the main source of income; ""For them, they only do this because they have no economic alternative."" Last year Peru received $38 million from the U.S. for the eradication of illicit coca crops, but Humala did not say whether he would ask for increased financial assistance. The announcement is the latest indicator that, unlike fellow leftists Evo Morales, president of Bolivia, and Hugo Chavez, president of Venezuela, Humala's administration will cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts. This was thrown into doubt last month, when Humala raised the ire of U.S. drug officials by temporarily suspending coca eradication efforts in the country. "	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Human Smuggling from Asia to Latin America On Rise. Authorities dismantled a transnational human smuggling ring that brought migrants from South Asia to Brazil and then transported them all the way to the US-Mexico border, relying on a vast network of smugglers and charging thousands for their services. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Brazilian authorities conducted a joint operation on October 31, arresting Saifullah Al-Mamun, a Bangladeshi national who was living in Sao Paulo after entering Brazil six years ago as a refugee. He has been charged with eight counts of human smuggling, according to a US federal indictment. Brazil authorities said that the ring moved some $10 million and had been in operation since 2014, smuggling hundreds of migrants. Seven other people were arrested during the operation and 42 bank accounts linked to the smuggling ring were seized, US prosecutors said. According to the indictment, Al-Mamun brought the migrants to Brazil on commercial flights and then arranged for their travel through network of smugglers operating in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala. In the city of Tapachula, along the southern Mexico border, the migrants were met by Mohamed Milon Hossain, a Bangladeshi national in Mexico, who was arrested on August 31 and pleaded guilty to human smuggling charges. Milon Hossain secured the migrants' flights to northern Mexico. There, the migrants were met by Moktar Hossain, a Bangladeshi national living in Monterrey who has also pleaded guilty to human smuggling charges. He arranged for their lodging and their movement to Rio Grande and finally their smuggling across the Texas-Mexico border. The service cost around $12,500 per person, Reuters reported. The fee covered not only the long, dangerous journey but also the creation of false papers. It was also reported that a lawyer was helping the ring with migration issues and requests prior to migrants arriving in Brazil. While Central American migrants are the focus of US authorities, this bust shows how Latin American networks are used to move Asian migrants to the United States. This highly organized smuggling ring operated across two continents, maintained smuggling contacts in at least eight countries, and created credible false documents that permitted the migrants to seek asylum and board commercial flights. The smuggling of migrants from Asia to South America is on the rise, according to a 2018 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The migrants often arrive by commercial flight to Sao Paulo, where international smuggling rings -- like the one busted recently -- use local smuggling contacts to coordinate the logistics of moving the migrants on the dangerous journey north. Colombian authorities have been stopping large groups of Asian and African migrants since 2015. The migrants first trek across the Darien Gap, a mountainous rainforest between Colombia and Panama. Once in Central America, they face the same threats as other migrants: robbery and violence by gangs that patrol smuggling routes. Such attacks are also common in Mexico , where the migrants must also contend with mafias that demand fees for safe passage. Tapachula, a Mexican city along the northern Guatemala border, is a major entry point for migrants outside of Latin America, according to a 2018 Organization of American States report , titled ""Irregular Migration Flows to the Americas from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean."" The report also noted an increase in the use of false documents. According to Roeland De Wilde , head of the International Organization for Migration in Costa Rica, it is likely this type of people smuggling will increase in Latin America, given the increasing difficulties which migrants from a number of Asian countries face when entering Europe."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"92% of Crimes in Mexico Go Unreported: Survey. Mexico's 2012 National Survey on Victimization and Perception of Public Security revealed that almost 92 percent of crime were not reported by victims, due mainly to a lack of faith in police and the judicial system. The survey, released on September 27 by Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) , measures victimization of crimes under state or local jurisdiction such as kidnapping, robbery, extortion, rape, and assault, but does not measure federal crimes crimes such as homicide, organized crime, or migrant trafficking. According to the survey, one out of three Mexican households had at least one resident who was the victim of some form of crime in 2011. The most common crime was robbery or assault, either on the street or on public transportation (28.9 percent of crimes), followed by extortion (19.6 percent). The overall level of crime recorded in 2011 was not significantly different than in 2010. Despite this high level of victimization, 92 percent of victims did not report the crime to authorities, meaning that 20.5 million crimes went unreported in 2011. 63.2 percent of those surveyed said they did not report crimes because of a lack of faith in either the competence or the trustworthiness of the authorities. Of those who did report crimes, 61 percent of respondents reported that either ""nothing happened"" or their case ""was not resolved."" The extremely high percentage of crimes that go unreported -- a statistic known as the ""cifra negra,"" or ""black statistic"" -- illustrates the degree to which Mexicans do not trust the country's police or courts. Citizens' unwillingness to report crimes due to concerns about corrupt or incompetent authorities has contributed to the country's abysmally low overall conviction rate, which the Justice in Mexico Project reports at around 2 percent. Mexico is currently undergoing a major shift in its judicial system as it transitions from an archaic inquisitorial system to a more modern adversarial one with open, oral trials. This process, while slow and often challenging, has been more successful than Mexico's multiple failed attempts at police reform. Many of Mexico's legal professionals, surveyed by the Transborder Institute in 2011 , hope that the reforms, which include improved legal protection for the accused and further transparency and accountability measures, will eventually improve the legitimacy of the judicial system in the eyes of the Mexican public."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Interpol Launches Anti-Piracy Op Across Americas. A massive operation led by police agency Interpol against the trafficking of counterfeited goods across South, Central and North America indicates the prevalence of this illegal trade across the hemisphere. The network reportedly operated in 11 countries, from Colombia north to Central America, Mexico, the US and Canada. Operation Maya involved more than 1,000 separate police actions between March 1 and 15, according to Interpol , and is ongoing. Some 200 people have been arrested and $30 million of products seized, including toys, beauty products, tobacco and computer programs. Interpol project manager Roberto Manriquez said that, ""Operation Maya again shows that there is no product which is not being counterfeited and criminals are using every means available to traffic fake and illicit goods."" The press release said that the operation had also identified routes that organized criminal groups used to traffic archaeological items, wildlife, and images depicting child pornography. The size of Interpol's operation is an indication of the significance of the counterfeit goods market in the Americas. Global Financial Integrity 's report "" Transnational Crime in the Developing World "" estimated the global market in counterfeited goods to be worth some $250 billion a year, making it the second most profitable illicit market, behind drug trafficking. Interpol noted the sophistication of the counterfeiters' operations, saying that they would smuggle pirated goods into a country through one route, while branding items like logos, labels and stickers would be sent separately. There is evidence that drug trafficking organizations in countries including Mexico and Colombia have moved into counterfeiting. Mexico's Familia Michoacana were thought to be involved in software piracy, while Colombia's neo-paramilitaries may be involved in the fake liquor trade. "	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Report Reveals Intersection of Development Projects, Organized Crime in Honduras. A new report by the watchdog group Global Witness suggests that state institutions co-opted by business and political elites helped transform Honduras into the world's most dangerous place for environmental activists, highlighting how criminal networks can turn development projects into deadly illicit enterprises. The report by Global Witness -- an organization that investigates how corruption and the exploitation of natural resources drive environmental and human rights abuses -- says that 123 environmental activists have been killed in Honduras since 2009, when a coup ousted then-President Manuel Zelaya. According to the report, ""Nowhere on earth are you more likely to be killed for protesting the theft of land and destruction of the natural world than in Honduras."" Over the course of two years, Global Witness interviewed dozens of witnesses and conducted extensive research to better understand the ""economic and political forces"" behind the murders. These investigations helped produce five specific case studies -- three of which involved the murder of an environmental activist -- that highlight how corrupt and criminal acts allowed ""well-connected Hondurans to push through their business deals at a huge cost to whole communities and the environment."" While each study details a specific case, the sheer influence and power of Honduran business and political elites is a constant theme. In one study, Global Witness alleges a ""clear conflict of interest"" for Honduran National Party President and Vice President of Congress, Gladis Aurora Lopez, in two hydroelectric dam projects that violently repressed the community members who opposed them. According to documents leaked to Global Witness, Lopez's husband, Arnold Gustavo Castro, is the sole director of Inversiones Encinos S.A. and Inversiones Aurora S.A., the two companies that own the Los Encinos and La Aurora hydroelectric dam projects. Global Witness alleges Lopez's political influence helped the companies illegally obtain contracts for the projects while she was in Congress. Under a Honduran law cited by the report, the government is not authorized to grant members of Congress or their spouses contracts or concessions granted by the state. Instead of bringing economic development to the area, the allegedly illegal dam projects appear to have brought a wave of deceit and violent repression. After heavy machinery arrived for construction of the Los Encinos dam, residents of Santa Elena ""organized a series of peaceful protests"" demanding that the company formally consult with those who would be affected. In response, community members allege that Lopez backed an attempted violent eviction of Santa Elena's residents where they were ""shot at, had their crops destroyed and belongings set on fire."" This came after three indigenous activists who opposed the dam in Santa Elena were murdered. One was found dismembered, while reports described another who was found with burns across his body and his hands bound with military boot laces. To quell the opposition, eyewitnesses told Global Witness that Lopez allegedly arranged for ""almost 600 Salvadoran nationals"" who were promised work on the Los Encinos dam to sign agreements to the concession of the dam as if they were part of the communities to be affected. When Global Witness reviewed the document outlining the consultation, however, the signatures were missing. For three years, the Lenca Indigenous Movement of La Paz (Movimiento Indigena Lenca de La Paz Honduras - MILPAH) filed requests to the Sant Elena Mayor's office for the signatures. It also filed a complaint with the anti-corruption prosecutor. But the mayor's office never disclosed the list and eventually said it had lost it, suggesting what Global Witness described as a ""deliberate effort by authorities to cover up the fake consultation on the dam."" When Lo?pez was asked to comment on these allegatons, Global Witness reported that she ""denied any involvement in the consultation meeting for the Los Encinos project or in the violent police incursion of September 2014."" Regarding the contracts that Congress approved for the projects, Lo?pez and her husband both denied any conflict of interest or illegality. Economic development can be a messy business, especially in places like Honduras where endemic corruption and impunity expose vulnerable communities to the possibility of exploitation. Through forming criminal structures that use violence and corruption, some business and political elites appear to have taken advantage of these development projects for their own enrichment. The situation became particularly acute, according to Global Witness, following a 2009 coup in which then-President Manuel Zelaya was deposed. In the aftermath, business and political elites solidified control over certain industries and development projects, exploiting the country's resources and violently repressing communities occupying the land. While corruption and impunity are a given in Honduras, it seems that economic development projects are increasingly being used, at times illegally, to enrich political elites. And Honduran accountability systems have shown difficulties in holding allegedly corrupt officials accountable. As Global Witness outlines, accountability systems that have been put in place, such as the law preventing concessions to members of Congress and their spouses, have been ineffective. Elites have either ignored these laws all together or found ways around them through corruption. Finding ways to battle corruption and impunity is no new challenge in Honduras. And while efforts are already underway to reform state institutions , their long-term effectiveness in combatting corruption and violence surrounding economic development projects remains to be seen."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Mexico Captures First Female Zetas Boss. Officials announced the capture of the first known female boss of the Zetas drug gang, close to Monterrey, north Mexico. On Monday, the Mexican Marines announced the arrest of a woman who authorities claim served as the chief of the ""plaza,"" or drug trafficking territory, of San Nicolas de los Garza, outside Monterrey. Veronica Mireya Moreno Carreon, alias ""La Flaca,"" (the skinny girl) allegedly took over the plaza after the capture of Raul Garcia Rodriguez, alias ""El Sureno"" in August. According to Mexico's El Universal , she is the first woman known to head a plaza. This development has some potentially interesting implications for gender dynamics in Mexico's criminal underworld. As InSight Crime has reported, women have traditionally played less of a role in the drug trade, with very few exceptions. Aside from working as drug mules, women are generally perceived as targets for organized crime rather than as full-fledged participants. However, this pattern may be changing. In 2010 the National Women's Institute (INMUJERES) claimed that the number of females incarcerated in Mexico for links to the drug trade rose 400 percent between 2007 and 2010. Recent anecdotal evidence suggests that the Zetas may be particularly ambitious in recruiting women. When officials broke up a Zetas training camp last June, they were surprised to find that half of the trainees were females. Even if this does not reflect the group's policy, these two incidents prove at the very least that gender roles are shifting as the drug conflict heats up.

"Mexican Authorities Accuse Vigilantes of Drug Cartel Ties. Mexican authorities have accused a vigilante group in southwest Mexico of being a front for a drug cartel, in what could be a sign of criminal infiltration of the self-defense groups, or just a smear from the threatened security forces. The claims followed the arrests of at least 30 members of a self-proclaimed ""community police"" force in an army operation in Buenavista Tomatlan municipality, northern Michoacan state. The raid freed the local police director and five other officers who the group had been holding captive after abducting them a week before. The group had announced previously that the six police would be submitted to a ""public trial,"" reported Proceso. In a press conference, members of the Secretary of National Defense (Sedena) said they believed that the suspects, some of whom are minors, were armed by the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (Cartel de Jalisco - Nueva Generacion). Other reports identified the group as full-blown members of the cartel or even as drug traffickers posing a s members of self-defense groups. At the time of their arrest, the group were carrying high caliber firearms -- some used exclusively by the military -- including AK-47s, assault rifles, and so-called ""cop-killer"" pistols -- so named for their ability to pierce bulletproof vests. A total of 47 weapons were confiscated during the operation, and Sedena officials said they would be used as evidence to demonstrate the group's ties to drug traffickers. As calls have grown for the legalization of civilian self-defense groups in west Mexico, and some vigilante groups have actively sought legal recognition , concerns have grown that these groups could morph into paramilitary organizations, or develop ties to criminal gangs. If the authorities' claims that the group in Michoacan were working for a cartel are true, then it would confirm these fears. Reports that the group was so well-equipped and heavily armed lend credence to the authorities' allegations. However, it also cannot be ruled out the claims are false and designed to undermine the vigilantes and provide justification for bringing the group down. The fact that the group were holding police captive and threatening to try them in public would certainly provide ample motivation for the security forces to move against them."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
Uruguay Takes On Multi-Million Dollar Chicken Smuggling Trade. Customs authorities in Uruguay have seized over two tons of contraband chicken as part of a crackdown on the smuggling networks that are exploiting tax laws and exchange rates to undercut the country's legal economy. Uruguay's National Customs Directorate (DNA) announced it has launched over 100 counter-smuggling operations along the Brazilian border in the last week. Of these, 40 resulted in seizures adding up to 2.5 tons of contraband meat. The wave of operations followed meetings between DNA leaders and the Uruguayan Chamber of Poultry Processors (CUPRA), who had previously claimed one in four chickens consumed in Uruguay is smuggled in from Brazil in a contraband trade worth $40 million a year. The smuggled chickens undercut their legal competitors by over 20 percent as they do not pay import tariffs, fees, or sales tax. According to the DNA, the operations are targeting major smuggling networks as well as small time smugglers, reported El Observador. Uruguay's DNA had begun focusing its anti-smuggling efforts on the border with Brazil even before the latest operations, as the devaluation of the Brazilian Real over the last year has created a new economic incentive for smuggling. According to the commercial guild known as the Artigas Center for Commerce and Industry, along the border region of Artigas the new flood of contraband from Brazil is costing members a total of $25 million a month. Smuggling can be found throughout the region wherever such economic incentives are present and can represent a major threat to legal economies. While much contraband around the region is moved by low level smugglers trying to squeeze out a living in difficult circumstances, the profits on offer have also spurred the development of sophisticated smuggling mafias that operate in countries such as Peru and Colombia. The measures taken to combat smuggling in Uruguay have already proven controversial , with residents of border regions protesting the disruption to their lives -- a phenomenon reflected around the region where smuggling is often seen as part of daily life. If Uruguay is to successfully tackle the trade, it will need to learn lessons from neighbors such as Colombia and Venezuela , which are learning the hard way that increasing border security is not a permanent solution as long as economic incentives remain.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Govt Claims Crime Falling in Venezuela. Crime in Venezuela has fallen by 7 percent since the start of the military-led ""Plan Patria Segura,"" according to the government, although ongoing controversies over official statistics cast doubts on the claim. Venezuela's Ministry for the Interior and Justice released figures showing that since the security plan began in May, there has been a 16.6 percent drop in murders, 20 percent less kidnappings, 16 percent less robberies, 14.3 percent less assaults, and 3.8 percent less rapes when compared to the same period the year before. Vice Minister of Citizen Security Manuel Suarez Hidalgo attributed the drop to the new security plan, which has seen the deployment of the police and military to the streets, increased the control of community councils and seen government ministries work with social organizations, reported Ultimas Noticias. The issue of security has become highly politicized in Venezuela, with the opposition keen to exploit spiraling violence and rising crime to attack the government. The previous government of Hugo Chavez, for the most part, tried to divert attention away from the issue and rarely openly admitted the scale of the problem. The new government of Nicolas Maduro has proven to be more willing to engage openly on security and related issues such as corruption, admitting it is one of the most serious issues facing the country -- although placing the blame for it elsewhere -- and making it a policy focus. However, it is difficult to judge the effectiveness of the new security policies, as the Maduro administration does not appear to be any more committed to transparency than its predecessor when it comes to statistics. In 2005, the government stopped releasing weekly crime figures, and since then reliable data has been hard to come by. Interior Minister Miguel Rodriguez recently admitted the new government continued to conceal crime statistics and said he had proposed changing this policy -- but only because there was good news to report, as with the newly released statistics. Government claims of success are also undermined by a lack of trust in official figures. The controversy over the large discrepancies between official murder statistics and independently collated figures that began under Hugo Chavez has continued under Maduro. Venezuela analyst David Smilde told InSight Crime, ""Any given year if you add up the percent reduction in crime that the government claims, you would end up with zero crime at the end of the year."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Latin Americas Criminal Gangs Get Tech-Savvy. A surge in cyber crime emanating from Latin America has analysts warning that organized crime in the region is developing an increasingly sophisticated understanding of information technology, and the ways to make money from it. ""Cybercrime in Latin America has elevated to a new level,"" Dmitry Bestuzhev, who works for the Russian computer security company Kaspersky Labs, told InSight Crime. ""In the past both the knowledge and the targets of the attacks were very limited. But now criminals in Latin America are following in the footsteps of cybercriminals in Eastern Europe, including Russian-speaking countries,"" added Bestuzhev, who is based in Quito, Ecuador, where he is Director of Kaspersky's GReAT Team (Global Research and Analysis Team) in Latin America. The epicenter of this activity appears to be Brazil. The most recent Norton Cybercrime Report and the Symantec Intelligence Report: October, 2011 have placed the country in the top spot for cyber crime in Latin America. ""If you look at the basic areas of concern, such as malicious code, spam, phishing, and then track it by country of origin, Brazil has been placing in the top five countries in the world for this kind of activity,"" says Rafael Garcia, a Mexico City-based Security Expert with Symantec. Bestuzhev says cyber criminals in Brazil are attacking the accounts of people in other Latin American countries and even in Europe -- specifically Spain and Portugal. Last month, Bestuzhev said Brazilian hackers had put together a sophisticated, well-encrypted malware , the first time he had seen this level of cyber crime anywhere in Latin America. The code is complex enough to fool automatic malware analyzers, and can even escape the more advanced tests conducted by technology administrators. The software is embedded in image files as ""block code."" When the image is opened, a Trojan is installed which can capture data from online financial transactions. Criminals in other countries in the region are not far behind. Criminal networks in Mexico, Argentina and Peru are copying methods seen in Eastern Europe, and are able to manage large groups of infected ""zombie"" machines. Zombie machines function as part of botnets -- they are personal computers that, unbeknownst to the user, have been taken over by cyber criminals, with e-mail addresses harvested to push spam further afield. Online scams include sophisticated phishing campaigns, in which trusted addresses send out messages with links to apparently legitimate sites requiring personal data. This new level of sophistication from Latin America's cyber criminals does not bode well for a region already overrun with criminal activity and unprepared for a fresh onslaught. ""Latin America in general continues to believe that it is not a target for cybercriminals,"" Bestuzhev says. ""With this way of thinking, of course, defenses are minimal."" Yet Latin America, and Brazil in particular, is increasingly well-connected, with more financial activity going online and mobile. In fact, a just-released study by Pyramid Research estimates that 18 million people in Latin America bank via their mobile devices, with that number on course to rise to 140 million by 2015. While these are positive steps for commerce, Garcia cautions that one of the biggest cyber-security challenges faced by the region is the expansion of broadband and mobile services into previously under-served communities, which brings a large, unsophisticated user-base online. ""We see more access to these services, but not a lot of awareness of computer literacy or the basic security steps,"" says Garcia. ""If you are a cartel, it gives you one more way to benefit from your malicious activity."" Some regions and industries are more prepared than others. Bestuzhev says that the banking sector in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, has made considerable progress in security, having been forced to do so because their customers have been losing large amounts of money , though the sector is still fraught with challenges. Unfortunately other sectors, including government, have taken minimal action to address the growing challenges posed by the conjunction of an increasing number of connection points and an untrained populace. Over time education can help ameliorate these problems, but the worry is that this could take a long while indeed.

"El Salvador Gangs Teach Honduras Counterparts Secret Codes. Imprisoned gang leaders in Honduras are receiving instructions from their counterparts in El Salvador on how to transmit coded messages, reported El Heraldo, highlighting the collaboration between gangs in the two countries. According to intelligence information obtained by Honduran newspaper El Heraldo , gang members from El Salvador have entered Honduras to train their incarcerated counterparts and new recruits in secret communication techniques. As a result of a government initiative to block cellphone signals near the country's prisons, gangs in Honduras -- such as the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) -- are resorting to coded messages police refer to as ""willas"" to maintain contact between incarcerated leaders and members on the outside, El Heraldo said. The coded language, comprised of a seemingly random mix of letters and figures, is used to order assassinations and other crimes, as well as send motivational messages reminding gang members to remain strong and united, the report said. According to security officials cited in the story, these messages are communicated via handwritten notes, as well as social media sites. Reports of Salvadoran gang members training their Honduran counterparts to use coded messages illustrate the level of communication and coordination between groups in the two countries. Barrio 18 and MS13 members in Honduras maintain ties to their counterparts in neighboring El Salvador, which is considered the spiritual headquarters of both gangs. The interactions come when gang members seek refuge in territories controlled by others from their group based in the neighboring country. It may also include exchange of weapons, tactical knowledge and intelligence. The gangs have also communicated more as the MS13 and Barrio 18 negotiated a truce in El Salvador. For a time, a similar effort seemed to be afoot in Honduras , but that negotiation process quickly fizzled. And El Salvador's truce unraveled this year during a handover of presidential power. The use of coded messages also reflects the gangs' ability to adapt to changes in law enforcement tactics. Incarcerated gang members in Honduras previously relied on cell phones to conduct operations and commit crimes, including extortion, from their jail cells. Most of the top leadership of these gangs in both countries are in jail. In December 2013, however, Honduras passed a law blocking cell phone signals where prisons are located in an effort to weaken the ability of incarcerated gang members to send orders from behind bars. Faced with the same problems, authorities in El Salvador adopted a similar measure in May. Central American gangs aren't the only criminal groups who have used coded messages to communicate. In 2012, authorities in Mexico dismantled a communication system used by the Knights Templar cartel, which employed secret codes to communicate via radio, while the Zetas have reportedly used a similar system."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Testimony of El Chapos Secretary Reveals Cartels Inner Workings. Media in Mexico have released details from the testimony of one of arrested drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman's closest employees, which offer insight into the notorious kingpin's final days of freedom and the inner workings of his organization. The new disclosures, reported by Excelsior and other media outlets, are based on the declarations while in custody of Carlos Manuel Hoo Ramirez, El Chapo's bodyguard and ""personal secretary."" However, his account has yet to be independently corroborated. Hoo Ramirez, alias ""El Condor,"" was standing guard outside El Chapo's room when the drug lord was arrested in Mazatlan in late February. According to Hoo Ramirez, El Chapo had spent the past three years living primarily in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa. His testimony paints a picture of El Chapo as beset by violent personal feuds, which cost thousands of lives and restricted the kingpin's own movements and ability to operate freely. It also includes details of El Chapo's private life, especially his relationships with women. Hoo Ramirez's declarations also describe how El Chapo's organization trafficked drugs into the United States and how it branched out into new criminal areas, capitalizing on revenue opportunities found in Mexico's growing domestic drug market. The testimony from Hoo Ramirez offers a window into a number of elements of El Chapo's organization, and offers some clues about the future of the Sinaloa Cartel. For instance, he describes Nogales as the key border-crossing used by the Sinaloa Cartel for marijuana trafficking, a historically important and often overlooked element of their operations. Hoo Ramirez also talks about El Chapo's control over Culiacan's ""tienditas,"" or small stores that double as drug retail points. According to his secretary, El Chapo forced these vendors to align with his organization, which typically meant buying their drugs from the cartel and likely paying a quota for the right to operate. The growth of such tienditas is both a product and a cause of Mexico's growing levels of drug consumption. They have emerged as an increasingly important source of revenue for even international trafficking groups like El Chapo's Sinaloa Cartel. Local drug sales are also a major source of violence in Mexico. Compared to drug trafficking, retail sales represent a newer, more rapidly growing industry with a larger number of independent actors who compete directly with one another. As a result, there are more potential rivalries in Mexico today than there were a decade ago, which lends itself to greater violence. The desire of well-armed larger groups to control the tienditas -- Guzman's actions mimic those of his counterparts in other parts of Mexico -- adds further fuel to the fire. Another striking element of the account is that El Chapo had ongoing feuds with a large number of his counterparts, including several operating inside Sinaloa, the state that he theoretically dominated. Hoo Ramirez mentioned longstanding rivals like the Beltran Leyvas and Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, as well as more recently emerging enemies, such as Manuel Torres, alias ""M1,"" who had previously been described as a top enforcer for El Chapo. This is in addition to reports that El Chapo and his longtime partner Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada had been at odds in recent months. As a result, much of the state was off-limits to El Chapo's organization. According to Hoo Ramirez, Guzman's subordinates were unable to operate in northern Sinaloa cities like Guasave, Choix, Ahome and El Fuerte; in the coastal city of Navolato; or in the southern part of the state that borders Nayarit. In this sense, Hoo Ramirez's account offers another indication that, notwithstanding his notoriety, Guzman was not the omnipotent criminal mastermind he was often characterized as being. Hoo Ramirez's statements also further discredit the idea that El Chapo was the face of a more peaceful brand of drug trafficking -- his group was not known for the wanton brutality of the Zetas nor for the heavy reliance on extortion and kidnapping seen in other organizations, but the list of feuds he was involved in was larger than that of any other group in Mexico. His organization engaged in high-profile wars in Sinaloa, Durango, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Tamaulipas, five of the most violence-riddled northern states. Far from being an old-school businessman who deserved the tacit support of the presidency, Guzman may have been the nation's foremost generator of violence. It is hard to predict, based on Hoo Ramirez's testimony, the precise impact of El Chapo's arrest. The typical expectation following the demise of a kingpin of El Chapo's stature would be a wave of violence, as subordinates and rivals fall into conflict in their rush to take over his market share. That may wind up being the case here, and certainly Guzman had no shortage of ambitious subordinates and rivals eagerly awaiting his downfall. Meanwhile, according to comments attributed to one of his sons that appeared in a media outlet in Argentina, those close to Guzman are ready to continue to fight his battles. There are also some elements of the El Chapo case that offer hope for a more positive turn of events. One is that Guzman leaves behind two partners who have a similar stature to him: El Mayo Zambada and Juan Jose Esparragoza, alias ""El Azul."" Such figures are likely as capable of keeping the troops in line as El Chapo was. Secondly, much of the violence surrounding the Sinaloa Cartel in recent years was linked to personal feuds cultivated by El Chapo himself, both with other organizations and within his own. El Chapo and Arturo Beltran Leyva clashed because the latter blamed the former for the arrest of his brother, sparking an enmity that resulted in hundreds or even thousands of deaths. According to arrested capo Edgar Valdes Villarreal , alias ""La Barbie,"" El Chapo's dislike of the Juarez Cartel's Juan Pablo Ledezma sparked the war in Juarez that began in 2008 and ended up killing some 10,000 people. Consequently, if Zambada and Esparragoza succeed in smoothing over some of the personal enmity that El Chapo reportedly inspired, rather than making a mad dash to take over his network, we may instead see a calming of the waters."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Can Peace Colombia Contain Booming Drug Trade?US President Barack Obama announced he will ask Congress for $450 million to assist Colombia's transition from civil conflict to peace, but will it help avert the impending shakeup of criminal underworld and curb explosive growth in the drug trade? Obama said the significant boost in aid -- Colombia currently receives roughly $300 million annually from the US -- is intended to help the Andean nation consolidate any peace deal with Marxist rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ). The Colombian government and the FARC may be close to signing a final peace agreement after several years of negotiations and more than five decades of conflict. ""Just as the United States has been Colombia's partner in a time of war we will be your partner in waging peace,"" Obama said. With this announcement the United States marks the next phase of Plan Colombia, the massive aid package which has provided $10 billion to the Colombian government over the past 15 years, with much of the funds going towards police and military assistance. Obama said the new aid package will be called ""Peace Colombia."" According to a White House fact sheet , Peace Colombia will look to achieve three broad goals: 1) consolidate and expand progress on security and counter-narcotics while assisting with FARC reintegration; 2) increase state presence and rule of law in rural areas, especially former conflict zones; 3) promote justice and other ""essential services"" for victims. The Obama administration has outlined a solid strategy that addresses some of the most pressing security challenges facing Colombia in a post-conflict environment. However, the country's fluid criminal dynamics could make implementation difficult. With peace on the horizon after over 50 years of war, the Colombian underworld is at a crossroads. The FARC are in control of an enormous criminal empire thanks to their involvement in the illicit drug trade, and it is unclear what will happen to that empire once they sign a peace deal. It is possible that some FARC elements will switch allegiance to their guerrilla cousins of the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) instead of demobilizing, transferring decades of criminal expertise and criminal economies in the process. It's also plausible that holdout FARC factions could criminalize completely, and begin working under the umbrella of narco-paramilitary groups known as BACRIM, or ""bandas criminales."" Another obstacle is the explosive growth of coca cultivation in recent years. The number of coca hectares shot up nearly 40 percent in 2014 and 2015 is likely to have seen similar, if not even higher, expansion in drug crops. With as much as 70 percent of coca grown in FARC-controlled territory, this has provided a major influx of cash to the rebel group's income. Following a peace deal, Colombia's illegal armed actors will look to fill the criminal power vacuum left by a demobilized FARC. In order to prevent a recycling of criminal economies and violence, the US and Colombian governments will have to identify how the winds are shifting in the underworld -- and adjust their strategy accordingly."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Massacre Sign of Loco Druglord Under Pressure. After six people were massacred in southern Colombia, authorities said the killing could be a sign of trouble brewing within the organization of one of the country's most powerful drug lords. On June 1, a group of gunmen pulled up to a soccer pitch just outside of Villavicencio , Meta, and opened fire. Among those killed during the shootout were a communications staffer for Ecopetrol , the state-owned oil company, and a taxi driver. Authorities say that the intended victim of the massacre was alias "" Mojarro ,"" accused of working for one of Colombia's most wanted men, Daniel Barrera, alias "" El Loco ,"" or ""the madman."" Mojarro , whose last name is reportedly Saldarriaga , is a local crime lord in southern Meta, smuggling arms, drugs and running a transport company that served as a cover, according to Cali-based newspaper El Pais. According to authorities , Barrera may have orchestrated the hit against Mojarro because he is increasingly fearful that his former confidants could be clandestinely negotiating his surrender. Barrera is one of the most wanted drug traffickers in Colombia, with a reward of five billion pesos ($2.5 million) on his head in Colombia, plus five million dollars from the U.S. government. There is evidence that the pressure is rising against Barrera's associates. One of Barrera's closest operatives, Julio Alberto Lozano , surrendered to U.S. authorities in Panama in November 2010. Another alleged business partner, Ignacio Alvarez Meyendorff , was arrested in a Buenos Aires airport in April. These two captures could indicate that Barrera has good reason to fear that members of his inner circle are under pressure to give key intelligence to law enforcement. But suspicion might not be the only motive behind the Villavicencio killings. The massacre was obviously carried out by non-professionals who were not even able to identify Mojarro at the scene: he managed to escape untouched, although two of his alleged bodyguards (former police officers, according to national newspaper El Tiempo ) were killed. It is possible that Barrera ordered the hit because Mojarro was suspected of mishandling a drug shipment, perhaps selling the product to another buyer without Barrera's approval. There are plenty of reasons for Barrera to be particularly nervous about how his product is handled, which may explain why it he felt it necessary to make a point through extreme violence. Mojarro was allegedly close to Pedro Oliveiro Guerrero, alias "" Cuchillo ,"" the deceased leader of the Popular Revolutionary Anti-Terrorist Army of Colombia ( Ejercito* Revolucionario Popular*Antiterrorista*Colombiano - ERPAC ). Barrera has a business partnership with the ERPAC, buying most of his cocaine from the organization before shipping it on to the European market. But the ERPAC has been on shaky ground since Guerrero was killed during a police raid on his country ranch last Christmas. The group's newly appointed leader, Jose Eberto Lopez Montero , alias "" Caracho ,"" allegedly once worked in one of Colombia's most rural and coca-rich departments, Vichada , where he coordinated drug shipments on Barrera's behalf. So there is some reason to believe that Lopez had the contacts and the business acumen to maintain the group's good relationship with Barrera. But Barrera has other reasons to be nervous about the source of his product. Barrera enjoyed Guerrero's trust partly because the two coordinated the killing of a common rival, paramilitary warlord Miguel Arroyave , in September 2004. Barrera and Lopez Montero have no such bond. Additionally, one of the foundations of the Barrera-ERPAC alliance was Barrera's ability to negotiate a pact with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ) in eastern departments like Vichada. The ERPAC clashed heavily with the FARC when the drug gang first advanced into the department in 2008, attempting to take over the rebels' monopoly on the sale of coca base. Acting as an intermediary, Barrera negotiated a business alliance between the FARC and the ERPAC which still stands today: the rebels sell coca base, while the ERPAC processes it into cocaine and passes it on to Barrera's international network. With Guerrero dead, the FARC-ERPAC alliance has managed to hold, with one key exception. In February, a faction of the ERPAC switched sides and began working as full time mercenaries for the FARC's 1st Front in Guaviare department. This may have caused concern, both for the ERPAC and Barrera, that more factions would begin to splinter off and perhaps descend into infighting. Such instability would spell bad news for Barrera's cocaine business. With the threat of the ERPAC falling apart into undisciplined factions, Barrera would be less willing to tolerate infractions elsewhere -- which may have been the cause of the Mojarro -related killings. Mojarro might have angered Barrera by attempting to pass on intelligence to the authorities. But it is also possible that this massacre is another case of payback after a drug sale went awry. Barrera, after all, has many reasons to fear that the main source of his product -- the ERPAC and the FARC -- may soon become less than reliable. This would make other cases of insubordination even less tolerable. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Can Mariachi Cops Strum Away Mexicos Security Blues?Members of a federal police unit in Mexico have traded in their weapons for musical instruments in an effort to increase public trust in the institution, but doubts remain as to how much the move can actually improve the image of the force against the backdrop of the country's deteriorating security situation. Led by Mexico Federal Police Mariachi Musical Director Juan Ramon Soto, a group of 21 professional musicians trained by the police and prepared to react in emergency situations have exchanged their guns for guitarrones , El Universal reported. According to Soto, the group is dedicated to showing the human side of the Federal Police by bringing one of the most famous and popular styles of Mexican folk music to communities wracked by violence and high rates of crime. Soto told El Universal that the playing of music is symbolic as it shows where the unit is present, and he hopes the presence of cops wielding trumpets rather than firearms will break down widespread mistrust of the police -- a chronic problem in Mexico that has contributed to severe underreporting of crimes. ""Citizens have an erroneous perception of the Federal Police,"" Soto told El Universal. ""We're providing crime prevention through music and trust."" According to El Universal, the mariachi unit of the Federal Police is spearheading operations that focus on ""social proximity"" and ""crime prevention"" through musical concerts in some of Mexico's deadliest states, such as Michoacan, Tamaulipas and Sinaloa. Mexican citizens have an incredibly low amount of trust in the country's security forces, and that trust is not likely to be rebuilt simply through song. According to a January 2017 opinion poll , Mexico's Municipal Police were the lowest-rated security institution in the country, while the Federal Police were rated only slightly better. Moreover, two-thirds of those surveyed believe that the police are ""controlled by organized crime,"" and more than a fifth said that only a total overhaul would improve public trust in the institution. The creation of the mariachi unit is a creative attempt to address a serious problem, but the move doesn't tackle the structural issues contributing to a breakdown of public trust in authorities amid rising violence in Mexico. Improving the image of the often overworked and underpaid Federal Police is an important goal, but one that will only be met with serious large-scale reforms."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Smuggling of Drugs, People Spurs Violence in Argentina Contraband Hotbed. Recent media reports point to the rise of drug and human trafficking on the Bolivia-Argentina border as the cause of spiking violence among local smugglers. An apparent revenge killing linked to drug trafficking in Argentina's Salta province has provided the latest evidence that the growing flow of drugs and unauthorized migrants from Bolivia into Argentina has fueled violence in the region, according to La Nacion. Raul ""Coya"" Martinez, a suspected trafficker, was killed on May 6 in Oran, a city in Salta province on the country's northwest border with Bolivia. His murder appears to have served as retaliation for the gunning down of rival smuggler Adrian Ricardo Geronimo on April 29 in the context of an apparent turf war unfolding between their respective trafficking groups, according to both La Nacion and El Tribuno. This area of the Salta province has long served as a major contraband gateway into Argentina, and as many as 5,000 inhabitants of the two towns are thought be working as ""bagayeros,"" the local term used to describe smugglers. Oran prosecutor Jose Luis Bruno told La Nacion that an estimated 30 percent of the local population lives off the contraband business, which has boomed in recent years. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Contraband But while the smuggling activities cover an array of products, the more recent increase in smuggling drugs and individuals -- particularly Chinese citizens -- into Argentina appears to have led to the creation of structured criminal groups that a judicial source described to La Nacion as ""mafias."" These organizations now resort to violence in an attempt to assert their control over important territory and routes, authorities said. And due to armed robberies and past confrontations between rival smugglers in the area, a local bagayero said that convoys of smuggled goods are now protected by armed members of criminal groups, La Nacion reported. Argentine officials said that they will tackle the contraband issue and close down 25 illegal border crossings. But as pointed out by La Nacion, this task may be complicated by the high proportion of the local population living off the illicit activity and the limited resources of local authorities. According to the news outlet, the government had typically turned a blind eye to contraband in the area until the recent spike in violence. The recent violence in Salta province provides further evidence that a shift toward greater involvement in drug and human smuggling by local organizations has appeared to contribute to increasing violence in the Argentine border region. Salta has long been a gateway for smuggling Bolivian cocaine into Argentina, which is both an important consumer of the drug as well as a transshipment point for its further international distribution. The province is home to the Route 34 highway, which starts at the Bolivian border and winds its way south to Argentina's three most important urban centers: Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Rosario. The highway has previously been dubbed the country's ""White Road"" of cocaine smuggling. Illegal drug smuggling, particularly from Bolivia, has been on the rise in recent years. As InSight Crime has previously reported , official sources suggest the amount of contraband flowing through the area where the recent murders took place rose by 200 percent between 2006 and 2012. And as cocaine seizures have grown in Argentina, Clarin reports , Salta has emerged as the province where the most busts have been made in recent years. Similarly, there are indications of increased human smuggling in the region. Local authorities claim that the rise in smuggling of humans and drugs in the Argentine border region has led to increased violence, but official statistical data backing this assertion is scarce. Nevertheless, there are several reasons why this theory makes sense. The illicit markets for human and drug smuggling tend to be more lucrative and more competitive than other forms of contraband, meaning crime groups may be more willing to use violence to establish control in such cases. Also, the large amounts of money to be made in these illegal activities may have fed the coffers of local crime groups, allowing them to ramp up recruitment and secure more powerful weapons, which may also be contributing to their growing willingness to use violence to further their business interests."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas: Coverage of Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime in Latin America and the Caribbean. A report by the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, and the Open Society Foundations, on media coverage of organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean. It is based on discussions between journalists and academics in the region at a forum held by the organization. The contributors identify new challenges facing the media, such as reporting on organized crime syndicates that work across international borders. An excerpt from the prologue: The 8th Austin Forum on Journalism in the Americas started hours after the assassination of a 21-year-old photojournalist of the Ciudad Juarez newspaper El Diario. (Another young journalist, an intern, barely survived the same attack.) The shocking news gave a gloomy tone to the conference, where almost 50 journalists and experts would discuss the coverage of drug trafficking and organized crime in many countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. It became a dramatic reminder of the seriousness and complexity of the forum's topic. Reporters and editors risk their lives, and many have been killed in the line of duty, as they tried their best to inform about the activities of criminal organizations. Mexico has become the most dangerous country for journalists, who found themselves as targets, in the middle of the crossfire of the so-called drug wars, especially on the border with the United States but also in many other regions. Drug trafficking and organized crime, however, is a widespread problem, affecting virtually all countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. As we found out during the Austin Forum discussions, it is not only extremely dangerous to cover this issue, but also very complex to explain its real dimensions and implications. Drug trafficking and organized crime are a global plague with ramifications that cannot be understood through the traditional, body-count-based local coverage. Its coverage poses some of the most difficult challenges journalists face in this hemisphere nowadays. For the complete document click here (pdf) -- also available in Spanish. 	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Driving Across the Borders of El Salvadors Gang Territory. Gangs like the MS13 and Barrio 18 in El Salvador are rigid about enforcing the boundaries of their territory. This has dramatic repercussions for both the bus drivers who drive and the students who walk across these borders. ""This street is the limit -- look. The frontline of the war is right here. Here there are gunshots every so often. Down there are MS13. Up there are Barrio 18 Revolucionarios. It is an L. And we are in the middle."" So says a middle-aged man. He is the extortion negotiator for a bus and minibus route. That is his job. In a country where even Coca Cola or Tigo pay extortion , in El Salvador there are architects, street vendors, shoemakers, teachers, and extortion negotiators. The country's reality creates jobs. The man is responsible for negotiating extortion payments via telephone with gang members. The bus terminal where he works is right on the corner between the respective domains of the two gangs. It's a bus route that has the bad luck of running through an area where neither gang has been able to annihilate the other. Thus, the bus terminal must pay both gangs. It's not simply a matter of paying the gangs a fee for moving through the sector of the bus route that's in gang territory. If the bus route involves going through the territory of another gang, there's typically a fee for crossing that border and circulating through the area. This is the second part of an article which originally appeared in El Faro and was translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission. See Spanish original here. Read the first part of InSight Crime's translation here. Before meeting the extortion negotiator, I met with three bus owners. One of them assured me there are routes that pay more than four ""war taxes,"" because they cross the zones of three gangs, and in the case of the MS13, of two different cliques, both of which charge for crossing into their territory. It makes sense. To give an example: it does little good for the Centrales Locos Salvatrucha clique (based in central San Salvador) if the Criminal Gangster Salvatrucha clique in Mejicanos extorts bus routes in its territory but does not share proceeds. Members of El Salvador's military guard a truck used to transport civilians in San Salvador. Both the extortion negotiator and the bus owners ask for their names to be omitted from this article, as well as the route numbers and municipality. When writing about gangs, one writes what one can. The first rule is not to write something that can get someone killed; the gangs outline and limit things beyond just territory. The deal is that I can say the bus route is in the San Salvador metropolitan area. Together with the negotiator, we travel the bus routes by car. ""The negotiation with the MS13 was over four years ago. It stayed at $550 per month. The Barrio 18 asked $800, $900, whatever they wanted. They asked up to $1,200 monthly. Did you see the bullets in the office door? That was them, because the company didn't want to pay the amount they were asking. I began to negotiate, and they said they were satisfied with $700. They're criminals, but the Barrio 18 here are just kids. I told them $200. It stayed at $300 per month."" We pass through the territory of the Barrio 18 Revolucionarios. It is a rural place in the middle of the city. The principal street is paved, but the side roads are dirt. ""Look,"" says the negotiator, ""here is the border. All this is MS13 territory. Here's how the MS13 gets paid: I tell them what bus is carrying the extortion fee. I give them the license plate, the color, and the driver's telephone number. Somewhere along this strip, some two kilometers, they'll come out. But they will not tell you where they are. The Barrio 18 sends someone to fetch it. We can either hand it over to a gang look-out, or I'll throw a bag up there, and a kid will come to collect it. Look, over here is where they attack, this is where common thieves come out at night to steal the cash box from the driver."" Paying extortion is mandatory for the buses. Clearly. Given how the gangs have split El Salvador, it is impossible for authorities to protect the drivers of a bus route who decide not to pay. They are an easy target, making the same trip every day. If they don't pay, sooner or later, someone will be assassinated. In 2015, according to the police, 93 bus and mini-bus drivers were murdered. The bus owners unionized into two strong associations, and they often use the insecurity situation to negotiate with politicians. The unions say that in 2015 they paid the gangs $26 million in extortion. Emilio Mendez, a transportation worker on Route 16, became the seventh person killed during a recent gang-enforced bus strike. Here, on July 29, a family member collapses after seeing his body. The situation being as deadly as it is, paying extortion does offer some advantages. ""Here they attack? The MS13 have told me that no matter what, if someone goes around messing with or assaulting buses, they will protect me. I tell [a gang member]: look, the drivers just told me that two teenagers are walking around, one with white shorts, a hat like this? He responds, right away. He finds them and tells them: if you come back, we're going to kill you. It's more effective than the police. It's immediate."" For some, a relationship with the police is unnecessary in these areas. Or, if it is necessary, it is for paradoxical reasons. Some extortion negotiators will share gang phone numbers with police. The negotiators will ask police to record the phone calls, but they don't want to report any extortion. It's so that if they do end up being recorded by the police, they are are not confused with extortionists. When negotiating with a gang member, the negotiators speak as if speaking to a friend: what's up, dog; what's going on, bro; I'm sending you a good time, take it easy. Sometimes, the only thing a negotiator who gives his phone to the police wants is to not end up imprisoned for doing his job. Each time a gang member is killed, the bus terminal has to send a bus to transport people to the cemetery. The bus owner incurs the cost of the fuel and driver. The same thing happens around Christmas, Holy Week, or the first week of August, when the gang members go on vacation. The negotiator does not know the real nickname of any gang members with whom he speaks. There are eight phone numbers that he uses for communication. A gangster who one day calls himself Chino will call himself Seco in the next conversation. But the negotiator is skilled at identifying voices, and he knows how to keep track of which voices resolve which problems. A few months ago, two gang members boarded several buses far from the terminal. They claimed to be members of an MS13 clique, gave two nicknames, two phone numbers, and an order to the drivers: we want one dollar per bus daily. It doesn't sound like much, but in this case it would have been over $600 per month. The negotiator called the phone numbers given to the drivers and asked a favor: come to an understanding with the MS13 gang member to whom I already pay the extortion fee. He gave them the phone number of the voice he considered to be the problem solver. The negotiator connected his problem-solver with the other two gang members, and the issue was resolved. ""Well, here we leave the MS13 zone and return into the Barrio 18 zone. Did you see that look-out? There goes the bus. They have us well watched. Do you see that house? That is where you have to send the bus when there is a death."" Having a bus stop within gang territory means siding with the gang if there is a death -- or when gang members are looking to amuse themselves. The negotiator is pointing out the house where ceremonies are held for dead gang members. Each time a gang member is killed, the bus terminal has to send a bus to transport people to the cemetery. The bus owner incurs the cost of the fuel and driver. The same thing happens around Christmas, Holy Week, or the first week of August, when the gang members go on vacation. ""Sometimes they ask to go to El Sunzal beach,"" said the negotiator, ""El Majahual. Last time they asked to go to El Cuco. No, I told them, don't mess around, closer. Bus and gasoline. I negotiated with them: look, the buses are in bad shape, they are going to break down. 'Don't worry,' they said, 'we'll call a tow truck if they break down, and we're going to bring a mechanic.'"" The negotiator negotiates. If he already made two trips for death or pleasure in a month, he tries to work out a favor. He asks the gangs to look for another route, and they ask him for his buses. We return to the bus terminal. Five drivers greet the negotiator. They are waiting their turn to drive the route. The drivers cross the war fronts daily. Thanks to extortion, they have permission to circulate in different zones. Still, sometimes not even extortion grants them free movement. ""Here there is no Transportation Ministry or traffic police. I obey the gangs, period."" ""If they realize that a driver is tattooed, or drives around with someone from a rival gang or who is from a neighborhood closely identified with another gang, they take him out quickly. They call and tell us: don't come to this side any more. Sometimes they directly tell us that they don't want to see him working on the route. We had people that had to get new ID cards in order to be able to work without the gangs members messing with them."" Some people need documents with false information to travel through parts of their own country. False documents just to move around, the kind some Central American migrants buy to cross Mexico or enter the United States. In El Salvador some people have such documents just to move from one neighborhood into another. The negotiator says it is usual for drivers to make informal stops at the entrances of neighborhoods ruled by gangs. They stop, he says, so people who cannot enter these areas can get off the bus. I asked one of the bus owners I spoke with what they do in such cases. He replied that they fired the driver, who understood the reason why. If he works, he dies. The same employer eventually said something that prompted a momentary silence in the room: ""If the gang tells me this driver cannot work, he does not work. If they tell me not to go down that street, I don't. If they tell me to change a stop, I change it. If they say to me on a certain day that no buses will go out, the buses do not leave. Here there is no Transportation Ministry or traffic police. I obey the gangs, period."" The sentence carries added weight, given the man who uttered it had once been a member of Congress. The last week of July 2015, as a means of pressuring the government, which had increased repression against the gangs and the communities they govern, the three gangs ordered a general transport strike that was almost entirely obeyed. Some did not comply. Just this week, seven transportation workers were killed on the job. The negotiator gets out of the car and says goodbye through the window. I ask my last question: ""Did they pay a Christmas bonus?"" ""Yeah, $300 extra to the Barrio 18, and $550 to the MS13."" A Small Neutral Zone ""Before there were two groups on either side. They wanted to mark the difference, as they had divided the court into two parts."" Says the director of a school in Apopa municipality, sitting next to a basketball court. She is over 40, and is in charge of a school located in a neutral zone. On one side are the Barrio 18 Revolucionarios. On the other, the Mara Salvatrucha. The school isn't just near the frontier, it is the frontier. It is surrounded by two Barrio 18 neighborhoods and five belonging to the Mara Salvatrucha. In fact, two local leaders of the Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18 are studying within the school. For the principal, the whole situation is fortunate. ""We're on the border. It isn't clear who will take control of the school. We're in limbo. That is a point in our favor. While they work it out , our school is perhaps one of the few in Apopa they don't try to extort."" The money paid to gangs comes out of the pockets of the teachers. They pay in order to teach. Usually, as confirmed by this director and two more teachers that I spoke with, gang members send a message to teachers or janitors: we want this much money monthly. This money comes out of the pockets of the teachers. They pay in order to teach. One of the great advantages of having borders between rival gangs is imposing taxes. Everyone pays: companies that install cable television, the women that sell in the central markets , taxi drivers , Agua Cristal trucks, sailors that returns from months at sea. There are neighborhoods where the gangs require a monthly fee from every person who owns a vehicle, a tax on the privileged. This director's school, however, is in the neutral zone. No group has been able to impose themselves. ""The day the lines become drawn, we are going lose all the students from opposing areas, and we will be at the disposal of the gang that rules."" The day a gang expands its boundaries, the school will be theirs and they will not accept outsiders. For other teachers, this school's situation would be catastrophic. Instead of neutral territory, the school might end up in a war zone. A teacher in the department of La Libertad described his school to me as a ""peaceful"" place because ""we thankfully only have students that live in MS13 territory."" However, that depends on the disposition of every director, and this one in Apopa has been able to control the situation by making some concessions. They try not to expel or defer students, and do their best to help them pass. Sometimes, they even permit the school to become a shelter from gang wars. ""The school is a safe zone for them. A student was in a class that had skipped exams because the teacher was ill. We sent everyone home. But this student arrived. I know he is one of the leaders of Barrio 18. He said to me, 'Ma'am, please let me inside. I can clean. On my way home the police followed me, and I'm afraid.' 'Afraid of what?' I asked. 'Don't ask ma'am, just let me stay here.'"" While most police operations are directed against specific gang targets, in 2015, the most violent year in over a century in El Salvador, complaints against irregular police operations, such as massacres against unarmed civilians, have been recurring. The Attorney General for the Defense of Human Rights has said this has become one of their priorities. The institution has opened files for cases like the San Blas massacre , where police killed eight people. This included two people who weren't gang members but were unarmed and had surrendered. They died from gunshots to the head and mouth on a coffee farm. The director says some students have made attempts to add fuel to the fire, but have not succeeded in this neutral zone. There is no shortage of shouts of ""Barrio"" in the classroom when any addition or subtraction gives 18 as an answer, or applause when the result is 13. They've found markings of MS13 and Barrio 18 in classrooms. But after talking with the students, and assuring them their parents will be called, it is ""the same leaders who sit down to resolve the problem, and the next day the gang markings are gone."" The director, immersed in her complex day-to-day life, describes the signs of peace in a very particular way. ""Here it is peaceful. For example, a teacher has never told me that they are going to turn up in a bag."" They solved the problem of recess after the director gave a talk to the students. ""Here there are no young people of one side or the other, only students,"" she said. And she managed to erase the border on the basketball court. But only that border. ""From the school gate and beyond, everything is already mapped out. Some go to one side, some go to the other. Some wait a few hours to leave. They spread out. On each side walk members of each gang. The problem is for those who live in the MS13 neighborhood, which is on the other side of the street, not in the same neighborhood as the school."" These students need to walk the entire main street of the Barrio 18 neighborhood to cross into their MS13 zone. ""It has been negotiated for a pickup truck to take them, including the older students; there are students older than 20 in the school. The pickup only goes along the main street, it doesn't enter any side streets."" A type of amnesty, a safe passage, a temporary permission to cross the forbidden border, and only at certain times of the day and only for those in school uniforms. The amnesty isn't an all-encompassing one. It is only for this pickup truck that transports these children. This year, a Barrio 18 student crossed the MS13 border and was shot dead. A police officer erases MS13 graffiti in Zacatecoluca. In El Salvador, erasing gang graffiti is taken as a sign of disrespect, and can cost someone their life. The school director says the number of real gang members that attend the school are limited. She asserts that two gang leaders are 14 and 15 years old, and are studying in eighth and ninth grade. Children submerged in a war that has left them only able to visit pieces of the country. The rest are students who don't belong to any gang, but who live in gang-dominated areas. Yet they identify with their neighborhood, obviously. What adolescent doesn't defend their classroom? Who was not part of an innocent gang in their neighborhood, the kind that were used to winning wars of whistling on Christmas or puncturing tires or ringing bells? These students are doing the same thing, but in the midst of a situation that isn't funny. They are children responding to their environment. Bloodthirsty gangs control their neighborhoods. And even if not a part of the gang, they identify with its letters, its numbers, and they imitate its leaders, walk like them and beat up children from other neighborhoods who also aren't gang members. Do they do it because they're killers? Because they carry the death gene? Because they're worse than other children? No, because they are children that act normally, they acclimate to the situation around them, and that situation is abnormal, sick, and destructive. The gangs borders limit not only a basketball court or a classroom. Sometimes, they also limit learning. ""Once, a student told us: 'I have to defer this year'. I don't know why. He was among the students that were about to graduate into the next grade. He said: 'this year they've asked me to defer,' and he wasn't referring to his parents. "" Some people will say the school director in Apopa concedes to and rewards the gangs. They are the people who will never understand the complexity of this war. This war, which occurs everyday in the neighborhoods where millions of Salvadorans live, has changed the social fabric, every bit of it. A school's recess, the walk to work, the tests for employment, the places where soccer is played, and the hour a school is dismissed. ""Essentially, we maintain a year-long truce inside of here. My question is: What is there outside of the school? What does it offer?"" War. * This is the second part of an article which originally appeared in El Faro and was translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission. See Spanish original here.

"Arrest of Medellin Kingpin May Intensify Citys Gang Wars. Medellin's former crime boss 'Valenciano' is set to be extradited to the U.S., while his former allies the Urabenos appear set on continuing his bloody war for control of the city. Maximiliano Bonilla Orozco , alias "" Valenciano ,"" has known little else besides a life of crime. After his father was killed at age 13, he was supposedly taken in by Diego Murillo, alias ""Don Berna,"" the successor of Medellin drug lord Pablo Escobar. Bonilla trained in one of the city's famous "" oficinas ,"" or assassin's networks, and later inherited Murillo's criminal empire. Bonilla's arrest in Venezuela last week *appears to be the end of his rule in Medellin. The city is a valuable prize for the Colombian underworld thanks to its gambling, prostitution and opportunities for extortion. Medellin also offers strategic links to the Caribbean coast from Colombia's interior, making it a convenient rendezvous point for arms and drug smugglers. But Bonilla's influence in the city has been on the wane since at least 2010. After the U.S. issued an extradition order for Bonilla in April, he was forced to adopt a lower profile. Near the end of that year, he agreed to allow another criminal gang, the Urabenos , to establish cells in Medellin neighborhoods like Comuna 13, the city's most violent barrio. The Urabenos are based along Colombia's Caribbean coast, and needed Bonilla's collaboration in order to enter Medellin, a city with an intricate history of gang rivalries which does not easily welcome outsiders. The risk now is that the Urabenos will try to step in and take over Bonilla's faction of the Medellin mafia, known as the Oficina de Envigado. Parts of this faction may not be so willing to adapt to new leadership, however, which could cause a new spike in Medellin violence. Bonilla was hardly in a position to say no to the Urabenos' demands to establish a foothold in the city. Bonilla was fighting another former hitman , Erick Vargas, alias "" Sebastian ,"" for control of Medellin territory. Vargas had more street gangs, or ""combos,"" on his payroll, but Bonilla had the advantage of controlling international drug trafficking routes from the Caribbean coast. Bonilla had the contacts and the cash that comes from networking with other global criminal gangs, like Mexico's Zetas. But Vargas had on-the-ground presence in Medellin. While Bonilla traveled to Costa Rica, reportedly for gastric bypass surgery, or managed his drug-running operations from coastal cities like Barranquilla, Vargas ma de a point of personally overseeing Medellin's gang wars. This gave him home turf advantage against the Urabenos. But the Urabenos are ma de up of former paramilitaries or military and police officials. They are better trained and armed, and run a tightly disciplined organization, compared to the shifting network of small-time street gangs allied to Vargas. According to Medellin's Omsbudsman's Office , out of the nearly 9,000 youths thought to form part of street gangs, some 7,000 are in ""combos"" loyal to Vargas. This is by no means a set number. The Urabenos will probably have no problem in buying the loyalty of stalwart Bonilla allies like the Mondongueros street gang, as well as other bands of drug dealers and assassins-for-hire in Medellin's barrios. The leader of the Mondongueros , Carlos Esneider Quintero , alias "" Gomelo ,"" is pegged as Bonilla's official successor. Esneider heads one of Medellin's oldest street gangs, formed in 1990 in the northwestern Castilla neighborhood. The Mondongueros have traditionally concentrated on fighting for neighboring Bello , a city that forms part of Medellin's metropolitan area. They may not take well to the Urabenos' presence in Medellin. But the Urabenos might have an easier time trying to make good with Bonilla's former network rather than with Vargas. Unlike Bonilla , who tried twice to negotiate his surrender with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Vargas has shown little willingness to negotiate with anyone. In choosing to start a war with Bonilla's faction of the Oficina de Envigado back in 2008, Vargas proved he was unwilling to accept anyone as the leader of Medellin's underworld other than himself. Unless Vargas begins feeling more pressure from international law enforcement agencies, making it too difficult for him to stay in Medellin -- as happened to Bonilla -- he is unlikely to show humility towards the Urabenos. In any case, it is likely Medellin can look ahead to another year of escalating homicides. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Why Mexicos Governors Became A Prime Target of Criminal Groups. A growing stream of corruption allegations against governors in Mexico exemplifies how changes in the country's political landscape have inadvertently served to expand these officials' role in enabling organized crime. As reported by InSight Crime and other sources, a reputed financial operator for the Zetas criminal group accused former Coahuila Gov. Humberto Moreira of accepting $2 million in monthly payments in exchange for allowing the gang to open hundreds of so-called ""narcotiendas"" (narco-stores) and giving them virtually free rein to operate throughout the state. As part of the bargain, the Zetas intimidated and attacked political and business enemies of Moreira, according to the testimony of the former Zetas member. Moreira has denied the charges, and while they have not been verified, they do fit with the broader pattern of Moreira's tenure at the head of the Coahuila state government, which lasted from 2005 to 2011. After having operated primarily as an offshoot of the Gulf Cartel in Tamaulipas, the Zetas took control of Coahuila in 2007 and 2008. In so doing, they initiated a campaign of kidnapping and extortion that had no local precedent and turned certain cities, such as Torreon , into virtual war zones. Rumors that Moreira was directly responsible for the Zetas' rise were rampant during his tenure, and since his exit, Moreira's alleged ties to the criminal group have sparked multiple criminal investigations, including some convictions, against him and his subordinates in the United States. The grim arc of Moreira's career is not unusual. Two former governors of Tamaulipas, Tomas Yarrington and Eugenio Hernandez , are facing indictments in the United States for allegedly aiding criminal groups. Former Veracruz Gov. Javier Duarte is a fugitive with a raft of corruption cases hanging over his heard, while his former counterpart from Sonora, Guillermo Padres, turned himself in to Mexican authorities in November amid similar allegations. This confluence of stories on governors' wrongdoing is not a coincidence, but rather a byproduct of a Mexican political system that concedes enormous and largely unchecked authority to the statehouse. In the post-Mexican Revolution political system that dominated the 20th Century, while Mexican governors enjoyed a great deal of autonomy strictly within their domain, they operated at the orders of a near-omnipotent president. The power of the presidency provided an important check on their power. The multi-party system that emerged in the 1990s and 2000s brought the days of the all-powerful president to an end, but this opening had the unintended effect of vastly increasing the practical control that governors exercised. If a gang secures the support of a single governor whose state controls a major port or a border crossing, it has likely guaranteed itself a major role in the national criminal landscape. It is not a coincidence that one of the first examples of the so-called narco-governor essentially coincided with the end of the PRI's monopoly on Mexican politics. Former Quintana Roo Governor Mario Villanueva went underground days before the end of his term in 1999, amid rampant rumors that, in exchange for bribes much like those Moreira is accused of receiving, he had given the Juarez Cartel of Amado Carrillo free use of his state. After being arrested in Mexico in 2001, Villanueva was later extradited to the United States. After serving a lengthy prison sentence, earlier this month Villanueva was returned to Mexico and subsequently arrested. He is reportedly awaiting another lengthy prison term. Today, governors rather than presidents exercise practical control over their states' congressional delegations. They often wield substantial influence over the municipal governments within their states as well, as mayors rely on them for budgetary transfers and for support in advancing their political futures. This shift in the political landscape over the past two decades has made governors collectively the most important cohort in Mexican politics, frequently described as modern-day viceroys. Working as a unit, they are capable of scuttling a president's agenda. This has consequently turned them into an irresistible target for criminal groups looking for allies within government. The scope of governors' authority makes it ideal for criminal groups to try to corrupt or otherwise co-opt them. If a gang secures the support of a single governor whose state controls a major port or a border crossing, it has likely guaranteed itself a major role in the national criminal landscape. The Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar, for example, were largely concentrated in a single state, but that has been enough to make the gangs major players over the past decade. A gang can leverage the support of a key governor in any number of ways. They can use his government as a sort of beachhead amid a territorial expansion, as the Zetas allegedly did. Most governors control large and relatively effective state police forces, which, when deployed at the service of a criminal group, can be extremely valuable allies. Criminal groups can also use political support indirectly to lean on local governments. Governors can help gangs by pressuring prosecutors to limit prosecutions against their members, as many laws targeting organized crime are in the realm of state courts. As the chief interlocutors with the federal government, governors can also obstruct federal efforts to target one group or another. From a criminal group's perspective, governors are also more reachable than the president. The fact that they occupy a lower profile than the president makes dealing with governors far less risky. In addition, governors are not burdened with the prerogatives of statesmanship, from monetary policy to foreign relations, which limit time for focusing on law enforcement and security matters. Relative to presidents, governors are also more isolated from pressure from the US government to crack down on criminal groups. This collective dynamic is behind the spate of cases like Moreira's and Yarrington's, among many others. Although much of the commentary on security issues in Mexico focuses on the goals and missteps of the presidency, a great deal of the government's efforts are channeled through other offices. And as long as Mexican governors in key states are actively boosting the interests of powerful crime groups like the Zetas, there will be a limit to what federal policies can accomplish."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Arrests Top Figure in Medellin Underworld, but Impact Likely Limited. The recent arrest of one of the top criminal figures in Medellin, Colombia, is unlikely to have a major impact on the city's underworld, but it could incentivize other suspects to adopt a low profile. Juan Carlos Mesa Vallejo, also known as ""Tom"" or ""Carlos Chata,"" was arrested on December 9 while celebrating his 50th birthday. He was charged with aggravated criminal association, illegally carrying military-grade weapons and use of false documents. Tom, a career criminal from Bello, a town just north of Medellin, is thought to have taken a leading role within the powerful Oficina de Envigado criminal group earlier this decade. He is being held in isolation after having been transferred to a Bogota prison. According to El Colombiano , he will likely be extradited to the United States. Another famous criminal was also present at the birthday party where Tom was arrested: Jhon Jairo Velasquez, alias ""Popeye,"" a self-confessed hitman for Pablo Escobar who spent more than 23 years in prison before turning himself into a political activist and internet sensation. His presence at a drug capo's birthday celebration along with other top figures of the Medellin underworld appears to contradict the terms of his parole, meaning the attention-seeking former assassin could once again find himself behind bars. A Criminal Heavyweight Tom's criminal career began with the ""Chatas"" gang, which he helped create in the 1990s and which he would later lead. Under the rule of Diego Fernando Murillo, alias ""Don Berna,"" the successor to Pablo Escobar's empire, the Chatas would come under the banner of the Oficina and develop into a more powerful criminal structure. After Don Berna was extradited to the United States in 2008, various factions of the Oficina fought each other for dominance. Later, the 2012 capture of Oficina leader Erickson Vargas Cardenas, alias ""Sebastian,"" allowed Tom to step into a more prominent role in the organization. ""Tom was Sebastian's military chief As one of his most trusted men, he gained contacts. It was a succession,"" Nelson Matta Colorado, an investigative journalist for El Colombiano, told InSight Crime. SEE ALSO : Oficina de Envigado News and Profile In 2013, the warring factions of the Oficina cemented a truce and formed an alliance with their former rivals, the Urabenos, now the most powerful criminal organization in Colombia. According to the Colombian National Police , Tom was responsible for the trafficking cocaine through Medellin, while the Urabenos took care of shipping the drugs beyond Colombia's borders. Matta told InSight Crime that this partnership with the Urabenos offered Tom an additional source of power, in comparison to other Oficina leaders. ""When Tom arrived at the board of criminal directors [of the Oficina], he realized the little power he had over the others,"" Matta explained. ""So he struck a deal with the Urabenos to gain more influence and criminal backup."" Soon after the Oficina truce came into force, the United States began targeting Tom and his criminal associates. In 2014, the US Treasury Department put Tom on its ""Kingpin List."" And in 2015, the agency blacklisted the Chatas for ""narcotics trafficking and violence in support of the Oficina de Envigado."" By 2016, the United States was offering a $2 million reward for information that could lead to Tom's arrest. Limited Impact? The internal dynamics of the Oficina de Envigado have often helped shape Medellin's security landscape. But despite Tom's prominence in Medellin's underworld, his arrest is unlikely to disrupt the Oficina's criminal activities. Previous arrests of Oficina members of a similar rank as Tom were trumpeted by authorities but ultimately proved to have little impact. Matta said this is due to the Oficina's structure, which does not depend on a single figure for leadership. ""Today's criminal organizations such as the Oficina do not possess a pyramidal structure, but function rather with a board comprised of various directors. So the capture of one of them as just occurred doesn't impact the whole structure as it used to,"" he said. ""The organization hasn't suffered significant blows to its finances, so when there are arrests, they simply replace one piece with another,"" Matta added. ""The structure will be maintained, and so will its way of operating, because it's been a successful criminal model so far."" While Tom's arrest won't lead to the demise of the Oficina, it will likely spur some shifts in the group's operations. The Urabenos, which are under pressure following a series of arrests of top leaders, will likely be looking for a new local partner in the cocaine trade among the Oficina's ranks. Another likely effect of Tom's arrest is that it will encourage criminals to maintain a low profile to avoid being caught. This is a strategy that other criminal actors in Latin America have adopted with success. As one commenter said in response to the press release announcing Tom's arrest, ""a living dog is better than a dead lion."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Peru Seizures Point to Popularity of Synthetic Drugs in Region. The seizure of thousands of capsules of synthetic drugs in Lima illustrates the growing popularity of synthetic party drugs, such as 2CB, in Latin America, some of them easily obtained over the Internet. Peru's National Police seized an estimated 5,000 capsules of synthetic drugs and detained four dealers in Lima, reported Peru 21. The drugs included Ecstasy tablets, MDMA, LSD, and 2CB -- a stimulant and hallucinogen which has been popular in Europe for some years. According to experts consulted by Peru 21 , these drugs can be obtained from the Netherlands and Canada via the Internet. A single dose of 2CB, which is often sold in nightclubs, costs around $50 to $60 in Lima. A police official told press that these synthetic drugs are difficult to track because they can be easily prepared in people's homes. Synthetics drugs such as 2CB have recently been gaining popularity among young people in Latin America. According to the United Nations 2012 World Drug Report, while global production of cocaine and opium has fallen significantly in the past five years, synthetic drug production has risen, including both Ecstasy-like drugs like 2CB and ""legal highs"" specifically manufactured in order to avoid international controls on certain chemicals. The Netherlands and Canada -- the alleged sources of the drugs seized in Lima -- have emerged as market leaders in this trade. The Netherlands is one of the world's biggest manufacturers of synthetic drugs, including amphetamines and Ecstasy-group substances. According to the United Nations' 2011 Amphetamine-Type Stimulants (ATS) Assessment , as manufacture of Ecstasy has declined in Europe in recent years, production has increased in Canada, where Asian, Eastern European, and now Mexican criminal groups are involved in the trade. In recent years, opportunities for online drug distribution have also increased. Many black market sites, such as the infamous Silk Road, are accessible via Tor, an network that makes it difficult for authorities to trace sites and identify users. Drugs are shipped either through private shipping companies or registered mail , but the relatively small quantities of drugs sent, often in vacuum-sealed bags, can make detection difficult. Forbes estimates that Silk Road brings in $22 million dollars in revenue a year."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Latin America, Europe Sign Anti-Drug Agreement. Countries in the G8 group of industrialized nations, together with a number of countries in Latin America and Africa which are affected by the cocaine trade, agreed to use goods seized from traffickers to fund an action plan to stop transatlantic drug shipments. ""We affirm our determination to stop the transatlantic cocaine that compromises economic development, undermines democratic institutions and threatens international stability,"" says the statement signed by 22 countries and nine international organizations that participated in the Paris summit on the drug trade. Attendees agreed to promote intelligence sharing between European police and African nations used as transit points in the cocaine trade, including Ghana and Senegal. According to news agency EFE , G8 members also reaffirmed their commitment to the ""principle of shared responsibility"" regarding drug trafficking. As well as the G8 members, the summit was attended by representatives of Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Dominican Republic, Spain, Algeria, Morocco, Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa.

"Leaked Intelligence Points to Top Level Corruption in El Chapo Escape. New revelations about the jailbreak of Mexico's most notorious drug lord, ""El Chapo"" Guzman suggest that his escape was facilitated by failings on the part of authorities that can only be explained by either incompetence or corruption at the highest levels. A highly-detailed report based on intelligence reports obtained by Mexicoleaks, and collated and verified by Proceso magazine, describes how recorded conversations of the Sinaloa Cartel chief Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman and evidence gathered by his guards should have alerted authorities to a potential escape attempt months before he broke out of Altiplano maximum security prison in July. According to the report, federal police documented conversations that showed El Chapo was using his lawyers, officials from Mexico's Interior Ministry (SEGOB), and fellow inmates to try and gain access to maps of the prison layout. Analysis of the reports was submitted to then Intelligence Commissioner Ramon Eduardo Pequeno Garcia, the then head of the National Security Commission (CNS) Monte Alejandro Rubido Garcia, and the head of SEGOB, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong, but there is no evidence they were acted on, states Proceso. The intelligence identified El Chapo's lawyer Granados Flores as the person who had been tasked with obtaining the plans because of his knowledge of ""official hierarchies in penitentiary centers and other government institutions."" One report on his efforts made reference to ""a friend who ranks above Celina Oseguera Parra,"" the then general director of Mexico's federal prisons, who was arrested for her alleged role in El Chapo's escape. According to Proceso, this connection could only have been Mexico's National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido Garcia, Minister Osorio Chong, or then head of the prison system Ignacio Hernandez Mora. El Chapo's guards also suspected he was plotting an escape and filed a report on the possibility at the end of 2014, according to Proceso. The trove of information available to Mexican authorities on El Chapo's actions and plans in the run up to his escape point to one of two possibilities; a massive institutional failure to act on intelligence or corruption that reaches even higher up the chain than previously suspected. Incompetence can never be ruled out when it comes to Mexico's often disjointed and inefficient state institutions, but the lack of follow up on reports of a potential escape after officials had clearly dedicated serious resources to monitoring El Chapo, combined with his lawyer's networking, certainly suggests high level corruption played a significant part in El Chapo's escape. So far, arrests of officials accused of aiding El Chapo's escape have been largely limited to low level security agents, with Oseguera Parra and then Altiplano prison director Valentin Cardenas the only higher level officials to fall under suspicion. If Mexico is to repair the damage to its international reputation caused by El Chapo's escape, it may have to take investigations much further."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Key Points from the UNODC World Drug Report. The annual United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report on the global drug trade paints a picture of success in Colombia. But it's clear the real winners remain the transnational drug gangs, who are evolving fast in response to changing markets. Many of the trends identified by the 2011 UNODC report have been observed for several years now: Peru is close to edging out Colombia as the world's top coca producer, and West Africa is becoming an increasingly important transition point for cocaine trafficked to Europe. These are developments that continued, or even accelerated, in 2010, the report finds. The UNODC supplies plenty of numbers on interdiction, production and consumption rates. But out of the statistics, there are a a few key, general points worth taking away: 1. Coca and cocaine production is down in Colombia, but increasing in Peru This is a development identified by the UNODC in last year's report , and again appears to be the main headline pulled out of this year's document. In Colombia, net coca cultivation dropped 16 percent, from 68,000 hectares registered in 2009 to 57,000 in 2010, the report notes. Peru reportedly saw an increase of just 1,300 hectares between 2009 and 2010, but this represents the culmination of small, and steady, annual increases since 2007. Cocaine production also appears to be rising in Peru and declining in Colombia. One possible explanation for this is the so-called ""balloon"" effect. With law enforcement efforts stepping up in Colombia, drug traffickers are looking for more hospitable areas to grow drug crops, and process and ship cocaine. While more coca is being grown in Peru, it also appears that more traffickers are basing their operations in Ecuador. The country saw record seizures of cocaine in 2009, the second highest level in South America. Another balloon effect may explain why cocaine use continues to decline in the U.S., but is rising in Europe and remaining steady in South America. As drug traffickers have found themselves squeezed out of one market, they have moved into others. 2. Drug-trafficking organizations are diversifying their product The UNODC identifies ""positive"" trends for ""traditional"" drugs like coca and opium: in both cases, cultivation has dropped, alongside the production of cocaine and heroin. But this appears to be offset by the new, emerging market for synthetic drugs. These are products chemically related to banned substances, but with a few ""tweaked"" chemical compounds. These include a variant of cannabis known as ""spice,"" a herbal smoking blend that is sold legally; mephedrone, touted as a legal alternative to cocaine; and other local variants of amphetamine pills and MDMA or Ecstasy. Piperazine, originally used to treat parasitic worms, is now appearing in some markets to overcome shortages of MDMA. The rise of such designer drugs is a reminder that, like the market for any other in-demand product, the narcotics market is highly flexible and adaptable. This flexibility can also be seen in the way that drug-trafficking organizations (DTOs) are operating. DTOs are becoming more similar to multinational corporations, with an emphasis on networking rather than top-down decision making. This kind of flexibility allows for loosely-linked cells to handle the production, transport and delivery of drugs, criss-crossing three or four continents at a time. The greater diversity of such substances on the market also means the scope of the challenge is broadening for law enforcement. There are simply more products that need to be tracked, and many of the precursor chemicals used in these ""non-traditional"" drugs are not internationally regulated or controlled. These synthetic drugs basically give their creators a brief window of legality, before international regulations catch up and ban them. If these designer drugs continue to flood the market, the emphasis on cannabis, cocaine and opiates as the top three ""problem"" drugs may no longer be as relevant in coming years. In terms of U.S. policy, the growing prevalence of ""non-traditional"" drugs also raises the question of how substances are identified as posing the greatest threat to national health issues. As the UNODC report notes, in the U.S., overdoses on prescription drugs -- like oxycodone, percocet, vicodin and so on -- are growing more common than overdoses on cocaine or heroin. The rise in popularity for these legal ""highs"" may also explain, in part, the apparent shift in the U.S. away from cocaine. 3. The limitations of the UNODC reports are still clear The UN relies on satellite imagery to collect much of its data on coca cultivation. But coca fields are becoming smaller and smaller, in part due to pressure from eradication efforts. The satellites used in detection efforts work best for fields no smaller than 0.25 hectares. Especially in Colombia, coca is being increasingly grown among legal crops, or in plots smaller than a hectare. Coca bushes can also be planted several times a year, meaning that farmers can move back on land that they had previously abandoned. This means that many of the annual statistics supplied by the UNODC, especially regarding coca and cocaine estimates, must be considered rough and low-end estimates. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Argentina Frees, Deports Colombia Narco Model. Argentina has released and deported a model from Colombia convicted of drug trafficking in 2011, in a case highlighting the controversial Argentine practice of ejecting foreign prisoners after serving half their jail term. Angie Sanclemente Valencia was originally imprisoned in 2010 along with four others, following the December 2009 discovery of 55 kilos of cocaine in Ezeiza International Airport, near Buenos Aires. The drugs were intended to be taken to Spain, via Mexico. Sanclemente remained in hiding for five months (actively engaging with journalists on her Facebook account) and changed her appearance. However, Argentine authorities found her in a Buenos Aires hostel in May 2010, reported Semana , and sentenced her to six years and eight months in prison. According to La Nacion , she was flown back to Colombia on September 27, and is free but barred from reentering Argentina. The release of Sanclemente brings to a close a high-profile case that highlighted the methods employed by drug trafficking gangs. The model and her accomplices were pursued by Argentine authorities after the original airport haul led to the capture of a young woman, Maria Noel Lopez Iglesias, pressed into transporting the drugs by the group, which included Sanclemente and her boyfriend. Lopez received a suspended three-year sentence and served no jail time following the trial. SEE ALSO: Coverage of Prisons The release has also brought attention once more to the Argentine policy of releasing and deporting foreign prisoners early, just weeks after jewel thief and bank robber Luis Mario Vitette was sent back to Uruguay having served less than eight years of a 21-year sentence. That event caused controversy in Uruguay and led officials in the country to publicly contemplate mimicking the measure. While the early release and deportation of prisoners may serve as a useful tool for Argentina to unclog the prison system, it could cause havoc if other countries decide to follow suit; the case of Vitette shows the diplomatic and security squabbles that may ensue.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"A Former El Salvador President Tells How He Robbed the State. When former El Salvador president Antonio Saca admitted to being behind of one of the most well-known robberies in the country's history, he knew that there was something good waiting for him. Seated in the witness chair, Saca described in a strong and clear voice how he and a group of his closest confidants embezzled more than $300 million of public funds during his five years in office. It's unusual to recognize that theft brings benefits. But Saca, who was arrested in 2016, had made a deal with the Attorney General's Office: If he confessed, he would face a lighter sentence. *This article originally appeared in Factum and has been translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission. Its views do not necessarily reflect those of InSight Crime. See Spanish original here. In a courtroom in San Salvador on August 9, 2018, Saca explained for the first time the plot behind the multimillion-dollar embezzlement scheme that took place between 2004 and 2009. The former president provided details on how he siphoned millions of dollars from the state into his own pockets. He also described overspending public funds through bonuses, travel payments, bribes to journalists and transfers made to the accounts of the right-wing National Republican Alliance (Alianza Republicana Nacionalista -- ARENA) party that he was head of at the time. Saca described using front companies to purchase property without raising suspicions. Throughout his statement, he spoke of who he collaborated with as well as who advised him on how the money should be stolen. ""One of the ways that money belonging to the presidency arrived in my personal accounts was through advertising agencies. Not directly, but through the accounts of various legal individuals. This is how the deposits were justified and how the illicit activity was concealed,"" Saca said. Initially, Saca assured that his arrest had a political motive and that he had not stolen anything. But 22 months later, he confessed to the contrary in exchange for receiving a reduced sentence for the crimes of embezzlement and money laundering, charges that could have come with a 25 to 30-year prison sentence. In a sudden agreement after nearly two years of pre-trial proceedings, the Attorney General's Office announced on August 7 that there had been an unexpected turn in the case. Prosecutors had asked for a shortened trial, or in other words, for a reduced sentence. Even though prosecutors had already prepared an extrajudicial statement for his appearance on August 9, Saca changed various things at the last minute that were not included in the first draft, something that upset prosecutors in the case. The Presidential Gang That Brought a Permit to Steal Weeks before being elected president, Saca, and his closest circle formed a commission. The commission would meet on various occasions with another small group of outgoing public officials who supported then-President Francisco Flores. Saca met with Flores many times. During these meetings, Flores passed down, according to Saca, the use of the so-called ""reserved expenses"" item line for accounting, also known as the ""secret item."" According to Saca, Flores showed him a strange document -- a set of rules that would give him the power to step around the law and use millions of dollars of public money to his liking without anybody's control. This document wasn't a law, it was an executive agreement for the secret use of public money. It was so secret that only the document itself was evidence of its existence. It didn't need to be published in the official registry. The signature of just one official was enough to give these powers to the president: Saca. Former President Saca's house (center), valued at $8 million by the Attorney General's Office With the respective modifications, the document was approved the first day Saca took office as the president of El Salvador. Two copies were taken by the incoming private secretary, Elmer Roberto Charlaix, who later became a key player in the embezzlement of public funds and who, according to prosecutors, also stole part of the money himself. ""I delegated Mr. Charlaix to handle reserved expense funds, which meant that he would prepare the request for funds to the Finance Ministry. After they were obtained, [Charlaix] would proceed to disburse said funds in name of the declarant, myself, in his capacity as president. Charlaix was authorized to open bank accounts in his name to deposit funds from the presidency into those accounts,"" Saca said. This policy allowed funds from the main presidency account to be deposited into Charlaix's accounts and subsequently into the accounts of two employees of the Presidential House, financial manager Francisco Rodriguez Arteaga and accounting assistant Pablo Gomez. Saca's strategy, according to his own description of it in his confession, consisted of withdrawing millions of dollars each month that were initially deposited into two accounts managed by Charlaix, who issued false checks in the name of the president and later exchange them for cash. However, nearly a year later, Saca and his cronies realized that they were leaving too much evidence behind that directly linked them to the scheme, so they opened up 16 bank accounts in the names of Rodriguez and Gomez. Jorge Alberto Herrera Castellanos, the treasurer for the presidency at the time, authorized the issuance of these checks. Once they had the cash in hand, the former president could do what he wanted with it. And nobody, not even the Supreme Court, the body in charge of auditing the use of public money, ever detected it. ""While president, I realized through Charlaix that the investigation just wasn't done. The person in charge came to see if there was evidence, but he did not do a retroactive investigation,"" Saca said. A Broadcast Man and an Advertising Campaign To Get Rich Saca has been a broadcast man for 35 years and the owner of a radio emporium that covered the entire country. Before arriving at the presidency, he owned four radio companies that were valued at some $3.2 million in 2007 before he became president. After becoming president and beginning to exchange millions of dollars from the presidency into cash, part of the money was used for the state intelligence agency in El Salvador and for bribing public officials. ""Because of that, I took the decision to expand the government's advertising campaign,"" Saca said before the tribunal. The benefits were simple for the advertising agencies. If they accepted the agreement, they would charge two percent of what was set at inflated prices, while the rest would go to the former president's companies. Saca increased the income of his companies from $4,000 to $60,000 per month in order for the money embezzled from the presidency to finally make it into his pocket. After giving a statement that lasted an hour and a half, one of the prosecutors that brought Saca before the court stood to interrogate him. A series of questions followed that the former president managed to answer in a few words. The prosecutor asked a final question. ""Do you accept that you have fraudulently committed the crime of money laundering as you have been charged by the Attorney General's Office?"" With a firm voice, Saca responded with what the prosecutor wanted to hear. ""Yes, I admit it."" *This article originally appeared in Factum and has been translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission.

"Honduras Discovers Cocaine Lab. Honduras announced it had found a cocaine processing laboratory on the country's north Caribbean coast, the second such discovery in 18 months and a sign that traffickers may be looking to increase their processing operations in the Central American country. On August 28, agents from the Honduran Anti-Narcotics Directorate (DLCN) and national police force discovered a cocaine processing laboratory on a property in the northern province of Atlantida on the Caribbean coast. Five hundred kilograms of coca paste, 20 kilograms of cocaine and various precursor chemicals used to produce cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) were seized during the operation, reported La Prensa. The remains of a light aircraft were also found near the site of the cocaine lab, according to Honduran radio station Radio America. No arrests were made and police did not release any information regarding who the site may have belonged to. They have so far been unable to determine how long it had been operating for, though the discovery was the result of a six month investigation.* This is the second HCl lab to be found in Honduras in the last 18 months after another cocaine processing facility was dismantled in March 2011. As InSight Crime reported at the time of the first discovery, the presence of HCl labs in Honduras was a game changer for the regional dynamics of cocaine production. These labs have traditionally been run by Colombians, who perfected the processing technique when it supposedly shifted north from Chile in the 1970s. However, as pressure has grown on Colombia criminal groups in their home country, the appearance of HCl labs has become more dispersed throughout the region, with processing facilities found in countries like Bolivia , Argentina , and* Uruguay. Honduras is a key transhipment point for US-bound cocaine, with an estimated 79 percent of South American cocaine smuggling flights passing through the country, according to the US State Department. As illustrated by the large quantity of HCl seized in this latest discovery, not all northbound flights are loaded with cocaine, but are likely carrying coca paste to be processed in Honduras. One reason explaining this could be the country's deteriorating security situation since the 2009 coup and the endemic levels of police corruption in the country, a factor which allows criminal gangs to operate with relative ease. Another, as former Security Minister Oscar Alvarez stated last year, is that Honduras has relatively weak enforcement laws for precursor chemicals , a crucial component in HCl production. Seizures this year of precursor chemicals headed to Honduras highlight this with one valued at $6 million that had been shipped from China via Guatemala. One of the biggest questions from the find is who the lab actually belonged to. Colombian kingpin Daniel "" El Loco "" Barrera is known to ship cocaine via Honduras. The Urabenos also appear to have a presence in Atlantida as evidenced by the arrest of their alleged second-in-command in July in the provincial capital of La Ceiba. On top of this, Mexican drug gangs the Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel both have operations in the coastal province, according to former Minister Alvarez. The HCl lab discovered last year was in fact believed to be run by the Sinaloa Cartel. Prior to the arrival of cocaine processing labs, Honduras was already a site for synthetic drug production. In 2008, officials dismantled a large lab used to make ecstasy and methamphetamine. Interestingly Honduras has been the only Central American site for cocaine labs to date, despite the fact that neighboring Guatemala possesses many of the same characteristics that draw organized crime. It too sees high levels of corruption, is a major transit point for narcotics and has lax restrictions on precursor chemicals. Earlier this month Guatemalan authorities seized a shipment of cocaine paste, prompting the country's interior minister to declare the country was being used to process cocaine , but no cocaine processing labs have yet been found there. Considering the similarity of conditions there to those in Honduras, however, this may soon change."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Ecuadorean Presidential Candidate Falls Victim to Express Kidnapping. A presidential candidate in Ecuador has fallen victim to an express kidnapping, a crime becoming increasingly common across Latin America. Late at night on February 1, two people jumped into a Quito taxi carrying Mauricio Rodas, the leader of Movimiento Suma (Suma Movement) political party, threw tear gas in his face and took his valuables, reported the Ecuadorean news agency Telam. The kidnapping lasted about an hour, according to a statement by Rodas' party , during which the politician was driven to various ATMs and forced to withdraw cash. After being thrown out of the vehicle on a public highway in south Quito, Rodas was taken to hospital by a pedestrian. The presidential candidate later said the incident was not a political act but an ""example of the terrible insecurity suffered by millions of Ecuadorean citizens."" Express kidnapping, where victims are held for just a few hours and typically ordered to empty their bank accounts, is Ecuador's third most common crime, after robbery and assault. It has become a particular problem in Guayaquil, the country's second-largest city, with an average of 11 express kidnappings a week during 2012, according to online newspaper Hoy.com. The city's Citizen Security Observatory has calculated that around $185,000 was stolen during express kidnappings between January and September 2012, an average of $483.50 per incident. In Quito, express kidnappings increased by more than 60 per cent during 2012, according to a report released earlier this month by global security company Red24. However, this statistic is somewhat misleading as the numbers in the capital are still very low, with only 17 express kidnappings reported between January and August last year, according to the state news agency Andes. Red24's report claimed express kidnapping is on the rise across Latin America, with the crime becoming more common in Guatemala, Honduras, Venezuela and Brazil throughout 2012. Mexico was also a ""hotspot,"" with an estimated 3,000 express kidnappings during the first three quarters of the year. The perpetrators are organized crime groups, the report claimed, with victims typically locals of varying income levels, though tourists are also targeted. It attributed the rise to ""economic uncertainty and financial desperation."" Other public figures to have fallen victim to express kidnappings in Latin America have included the Mexican ambassador to Venezuela ."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Guatemala Fugitive La Patrona Recaptured in El Salvador. Authorities in El Salvador arrested a fugitive crime boss who had escaped from a Guatemala prison two weeks earlier, with officials from both countries crediting bilateral security cooperation for the recapture of the infamous ""La Patrona."" El Salvador's National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil - PNC) captured Guatemalan national Marixa Ethelinda Lemus Perez, alias ""La Patrona"" (roughly translated, ""the Boss""), on the morning of May 25 in the northwestern department of Ahuachapan, which sits along the border with Guatemala, reported La Prensa Grafica. La Patrona had escaped from a military detention center in Guatemala on May 11. A former mayoral candidate in the Guatemalan department of Jutiapa where she had repeated armed battles with rivals , Lemus Perez was sentenced in March of 2015 to 94 years in prison on charges of murder, kidnapping and running a criminal organization. After her recapture, Lemus Perez said she had escaped because she was in physical danger at the detention facility, reported Prensa Libre. ""I cannot be in a prison where my life is at risk,"" she said. She was handed over to Guatemalan police on the same day as her arrest, reported La Prensa Grafica. Once in Guatemala, Lemus Perez said ""I expect to receive a fair trial or else I will escape again."" Lemus Perez' escape two weeks ago was an embarrassing episode for Guatemalan authorities, as it drew attention to how much control inmates have gained within the prison system. Her recapture has enabled the authorities to alter that narrative by focusing on how law enforcement agencies from both countries had collaborated in tracking her down. ""The operation in which 'La Patrona' was captured demonstrates the good coordination that exists between the police of El Salvador and Guatemala,"" said Howard Cotto, director of the PNC in El Salvador. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales also tweeted his thanks to Guatemalan and Salvadoran authorities. Gracias a la eficiente coordinacion entre los equipos de Mingob, PNC y autoridades de El Salvador, se captura a Marixa Lemus ""La Patrona"". pic.twitter.com/LQ5D7YjIkp -- Jimmy Morales (jimmymoralesgt) May 25, 2017 But her arrest does nothing to address the endemic problems in Guatemala's prison system that allowed her to escape in the first place. Corruption in particular continues to plague the system, which has permitted some inmates to wield enormous influence while still behind bars. Until that changes, La Patrona could very well make good on the promise she made upon her return to Guatemala."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Paraguay Plans Pay Hike for Security Forces, Amid Corruption Scandals. Paraguay is on the verge of approving a pay rise of up to 40 percent for police and members of the military, a move which may prove useful in the country's fight against corruption and organized crime. As ABC Digital reports, both houses of the Paraguayan Congress have passed a bill to grant a pay rise to the police and military. If signed into law as expected, the bill would provide a 15 to 40 percent pay increase for members of the security forces, based on seniority and position, starting in 2012. According to Interior Minister Carlos Filizzola, the pay hike was long overdue. ""Police officers will now receive just compensation, despite the fact that they haven't seen an adjustment in pay or substantial raise in 10 years,"" said Filizzola. The rise in salaries is intended to reduce the incentive for officers to accept bribes or get involved in crime. Corruption in the security forces is a serious problem for Paraguay, as illustrated by the recent arrest of two police officers for their involvement in a robbery, and accusations that the marines fired on Brazilian police to protect smugglers.

"Mexico Steps Up Search for Rising Drug Boss Chapo Isidro. The killing of a dozen alleged criminals in federal operations in Sinaloa state, Mexico, is one step in the government's concerted push to take down drug boss Fausto Isidro Meza Flores, aka ""Chapo Isidro."" State authorities said that the 12 alleged gunmen killed by Mexican armed forces on July 10 and 11 in the Sinaloan cities of Guasave and Sinaloa de Leyva worked for Meza Flores, as Proceso and other outlets reported. Among the dead were Chapo Isidro's chief of security and two other men with outstanding warrants. Mexican authorities also carried out a series of arrests in the region and seized weapons and vehicles. The group headed by Meza Flores is often called the Mazatlecos, though it is given other labels as well. Whatever its name, the group has carved out a stranglehold in Guasave and other areas in Sinaloa, especially in the northern portion of the state. Sinaloa officials said that detaining Chapo Isidro (also sometimes called Chapito Isidro) is now a primary objective of federal and state officials, who are working in tandem. State officials have said that the search for Chapo Isidro will concentrate on the northern Sinaloa region where he is based: ""[Meza Flores] is being searched for and we will also seek at the same time to continue investigating other people that we have located in that area, to see if it is possible to detain them Yes it is people from that area, we are working in coordination with the armed forces there."" The search for Meza Flores is not an entirely new development: previous reports have indicated that the army has executed operations to arrest him on three occasions, and has failed each time. Meza Flores' profile has rocketed in recent years, first as a rival to Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, and now, since Guzman's detention, as a potential replacement for the region's most prominent trafficking boss. Meza Flores is thought to be 32 years old, and was an anonymous Sinaloa operator in 2008 when he sided with the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) after it split with the Sinaloa Cartel. In the years thereafter, Meza Flores and his group became the most important Sinaloa-based allies of the BLO, allowing Hector Beltran Leyva to retain ties to his home state despite moving much of his organization south. Thanks in large part to the growth of the Mazatlecos in Guasave, Sinaloa Cartel rivals -- including the BLO, the Zetas, and the Juarez Cartel -- had a base from which to harass Guzman's forces. Meza Flores' group has retained its hold over much of northern Sinaloa despite persistent attempts by rivals in the Sinaloa Cartel to drive them out. Dating back to 2011, banners have appeared in Guasave, Meza Flores' hometown and the geographic center of his operation, taunting Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman for his inability to make inroads in the town. In the years since, similar reports regularly emerged of Chapo Isidro and his allies resisting Guzman and company in northern Sinaloa cities. The organization's profile spiked further in January 2013, when the US Treasury Department designated Meza Flores' gang a drug trafficking organization under the so-called Kingpin Act, giving the government added power to seize assets belonging to Meza Flores. The US accused Meza Flores of trafficking heroin, cocaine, and marijuana into the US, and also named a handful of businesses used as fronts by the Mazatlecos. Since then, Meza Flores has been among the most prominent of the younger generation of Mexican traffickers. As the Mexican underworld evolves in the post-Chapo Guzman era, Meza Flores' group has some substantial built-in advantages. His base in northern Sinaloa stretches from Guasave, just a few miles from the coast, to the Golden Triangle, the mountainous region where many of the nation's marijuana crops are produced, and which borders Chihuahua on the other side. Meza Flores is also younger than his rivals in the Sinaloa Cartel, whose current leader, Ismael Zambada, is in his 60s. And Meza Flores has had the good fortune to have grown in stature during a period in which the Sinaloa Cartel leadership has been devastated. As a result, the most potent and obvious counterweight to his group could be tottering. Of course this is largely, if not entirely, dependent on Meza Flores staying out of prison. The public declaration of government interest in Meza Flores in both the US and Mexico does not bode well for his survival. Unlike Guzman, for instance, who was rumored to have traveled around Latin America as he stayed a step ahead of the police for more than a decade, Meza Flores does not appear to have a far-flung network to fall back on. However, there is no public groundswell demanding his arrest, making it far more likely that government interest will eventually wane. And, as seen in the long hunt for Chapo Guzman, declaring a target to be a priority is a very different matter than actually bringing them into custody."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
US Cuts Anti-Drug, Military Aid to Latin America. The US State Department's proposed 2013 budget will reduce military and anti-drug aid to Latin America, including to the traditional largest recipients, Colombia and Mexico. US military and police aid for Latin America and the Caribbean will total $946 million for the 2013 fiscal year, according to a database kept by Just the Facts. This is a cut of about 10 percent from 2012. Of this, $432.4 million will come from the US State Department, according to the proposed budget. This includes $155 million for Colombia and $35 million for Mexico. US military and police funding for Latin America has been declining since 2010. One of the most notable cutbacks in aid has been to Colombia, which, according to El Tiempo , has seen a 50 percent drop in funds over the past five years. The US State Department has stated that this drop is meant to reflect security progress made in the South American country. Some countries in the region have looked elsewhere for counterdrug assistance. Brazil in particular has increased its security and counterdrug aid to Bolivia. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Pirates, Contraband, and Mega-Gangs in Venezuela. In this second article, Venezuelan journalist Javier Mayorca examines the evolution of organized crime in Venezuela, from the first manifestations of official corruption and contraband during colonial times and the influence of Italian groups, to when criminal organizations reached their peak after Hugo Chavez took power. This analysis also looks at the role of Colombian groups and the violent mutation of crime in Venezuela under current President Nicolas Maduro. In 2015, the Venezuelan Observatory of Organized Crime warned the country had entered a new stage in the development of criminal activity, with the emergence of so-called ""Mega-gangs."" These groups, owing to their number of members, variety of illegal activities, and geographical dispersion, marked a difference in what had been seen before. This article is the second in a series of two by Javier Mayorca exploring the evolution of organized crime in Venezuela. Read part one here. These structures -- which do have comparisons elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere -- respond to particular historical, political, economic, and legal conditions that give them specific characteristics. From this peculiarity, the mega-gangs have formed alliances with similar groups that migrated from Colombia, and they have formed national cells of the Rastrojos and Urabenos. This also happened previously, with the so-called Aguilas Negras (Black Eagles). In Apure state, the Bolivarian Liberation Forces have evolved from a group of cattle rustlers and kidnappers -- who burst onto the national scene during 1990s -- to build a political base, which has allowed them to form alliances with municipal authorities throughout the state. How did organized crime reach this level of development in Venezuela? New Alliances, Old Problems Venezuela's attractiveness for transnational organized crime increased in 1999 when the National Constituent Assembly, convened by Chavez, approved the ban on extraditing nationals. The proposal of attorney Hermann Escarra protected both born and nationalized Venezuelans, and was received by the other constituent participants without further discussion. In all subsequent cases of major criminal detainees in the country who had international arrest warrants, it was determined they had Venezuelan identification. Chavez began processes of formal rapprochement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) and the National Liberation Army ( Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) regarding the kidnapping of a young Venezuelan in 1999. The mission was entrusted to retired captain Ramon Rodriguez Chacin, who was later twice appointed as Minister of the Interior (MRI). [i] In 2007, the president formalized the role of ""liaison"" with the FARC, the largest Colombian guerrilla group, on the eve of the release of Consuelo Gonzalez, Clara Rojas, and her son Emmanuel. Rojas was kidnapped in 2002 during the campaign of then Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt. [ii] Rodriguez Chacin, who is on the Clinton List of major drug traffickers, is currently governor of Guarico state. Since the beginning of the Chavista regime relations with the FARC have been fluid and at various levels. On the one hand there was a public link, with, for example, territory being offered where supposed peace negotiations could be discussed. Meetings between the Venezuelan government and members of the FARC central command, known as the Secretariat, occurred regularly. The Venezuelan government also sponsored public events for organizations linked to the guerrilla group, such as the Coordinadora Simon Bolivar. [iii] On the other hand, there was a movement of drugs and weapons through the country that benefited the guerrillas. This was denounced in reports by the US Treasury Department. Documents found after the death of Luis Devia, alias ""Raul Reyes,"" confirmed that assessment. [iv] The Evolution of the Criminal Panorama The guerrillas also carried out kidnappings of high profile figures (bankers and ranchers), and the ransoms brought in millions in foreign currency. In the last known case the victim was vice president of financial group German Garcia Velutini. The victim's capture was allegedly carried out with the cooperation of members of the Venezuelan military. [v] Simultaneously, settling in the country were members of organizations that were apparent FARC rivals, such as the Rastrojos, Urabenos, and traffickers that became independent with the diaspora of the Norte del Valle Cartel. Their main allies were (and are) active and retired members of the military, as well as members of police forces. In principle, Venezuelans were serving as ""regulators."" That is, they determined what activities could take place in the country prior to payment, and which could not. But, since 2007, they had been directly involved in the transportation of bulk drug shipments. In Venezuela, as happened before the arrival of Chavez, negotiations between drug suppliers, brokers, and those who receive shipments at destination points were also being conducted. Former Italian prosecutor Francesco Forgione documented the transfer to Venezuela of representatives from the Cosa Nostra, the Camorra, and the Calabrian mafia ('Ndrangheta). [vi] In other words, the active presence of transnational criminal groups in the country became diversified, a result of the perception they could operate with relative impunity. After the extradition ban, the Venezuelan government made several decisions that helped make the country an ideal territory for foreign criminals. In 1999, reconnaisance flights to detect illicit crops were banned. In 2005, Chavez ordered the cessation of cooperation agreements with the US State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affiars (INL), which had as an immediate consequence the expulsion of representatives from the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). And, in 2008, he threatened to remove Venezuela from the international police system (Interpol), although this did not materialize. These decisions were justified by a rhetoric of protecting national sovereignty. But, in practice, the effect was that the country's security became compromised more easily by certain groups considered allies of the regime. Chavez knew the armed forces were displeased with the warming of relations with subversives, whom they attributed as responsible for the majority of service deaths of soldiers and officers. In his eyes, the possibility of betrayal was confirmed in April 2002 when senior commanders ordered their troops to withdraw and not interfere with mass demonstrations demanding his resignation, in clear contempt of an order given by him directly. The Chavista Legacy and The Emergence of Los Colectivos After that experience, the president ordered all available resources into the creation, and in other cases the consolidation, of small armed groups known as ""colectivos,"" whose activities had until then been restricted to 23 de Enero (January 23) neighbourhood of Caracas, in Libertador municipality. The collectives replaced the so-called ""Bolivarian circles"" and were entrusted with the armed defense of the political process. Chavez's successor, Nicolas Maduro, would be one of the beneficiaries of this process beginning in January 2014. After a televised order, these groups moved against protesters in major cities that were demanding Maduro's resignation. The official death toll of these confrontations was 43, including Juan Montoya, the head of the colectivos secretariat in Caracas, presumably at the hands of his peers. Official support multiplied the number of armed groups emerging throughout the country. In 2014, the Ministry of Internal Affairs censused more than 90 groups of this kind in the Capital District during an ambiguous disarmament initiative. The groups, however, are generally are not considered criminal gangs, although some of them are known more for extortion and drug trafficking than for defending the regime. Along with them, a new type of grouping has emerged: the ""mega-gang."" These are distinct in that they have no political purpose. They are criminal structures through and through. The first major mega-gang in Venezuela has been operating for about four years in the territories of Aragua and Guarico. Its leader, Jose Tovar Colina, a former member of an elite Navy unit, is now an internationally wanted criminal. [vii] But the main factor that spurred the emergence and consolidation of mega-gangs was a program called ""Zones of Peace,"" the implementation of which began in September 2013 under the oversight of Deputy Minister of Internal Policy Jose Vicente Rangel Avalos. The logic of these zones was that the police and military had become a determining factor in driving homicidal violence in the country. Therefore, withdrawing them from certain areas would decrease violence. Simultaneously, economic growth in these areas would be encouraged through credit lines granted by a governmental foundation. The police and military could not enter these areas unless they had a specific court order. This directive is not supported by any documents, but police chiefs on various occasions have said the Ministry of Interior verbally reiterated this order. Criminal groups began using the Zones of Peace as a place to hide kidnap victims, according to a report from Bolivarian National Guard (GNB). Simultaneously these groupings were growing in strength and geographic coverage until they extended their criminal operations to places that were not protected by the ministerial program. [viii] In the immediate term, the Peace Zones were a factor that spurred violent crime. As described in this work, the regime itself seems to be working for the destruction of its own institutions. According to Carlos Tablante and Marcos Tarre, at least one-third of the homicides in Venezuela (the second most violent in the world according to the United Nations) are the result of organized crime, whose groups are protected by chronic impunity. This problem has not yet been fully recognized or appreciated by the regime, because to do so would mean admitting mistakes that would eventually result in the complete loss of power. Still, the result of the December 2015 elections indicates that the majority of the Venezuelan population has begun to take steps towards rescuing institutions.

"Risks for Mexicos Public Transport Workers Growing in 2019. Two public transport vehicles were robbed and then set ablaze in Mexico City due to the failure of workers to pay extortion fees, illustrating how public transport workers and their passengers are on the frontlines of extortion-related violence in Mexico. On August 1, Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum announced that criminal groups were extorting the city's public transportation workers, Milenio reported. The same day, the state's attorney general declared that investigators had identified two criminal groups responsible for extorting, robbing and burning buses, according to Excelsior. The first group is led by Miguel Angel N, alias "" El Monterrey ,"" who reportedly has a history of extorting and killing bus drivers. The second unnamed group is said to attack buses entering the capital from neighboring Mexico State. The announcements follow a sharp uptick in violent attacks on public transit in Mexico City. The capital is currently averaging 28 assaults per day on public transportation, nearly triple the amount seen in January of 2018, according to the National Public Security System (Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Publica - SNSP). An average of 800 attacks took place in May and June this year -- 100 more than during the first four months of 2019. Transportation workers have demanded the government respond to rising insecurity. On July 16, following the violent deaths of two of their colleagues earlier that month, public transit drivers blocked two major highways, holding signs with messages that read: ""Enough, no more blood behind the steering wheel,"" and ""AMLO, they're killing us."" Although drug trafficking often dominates headlines when it comes to insecurity in Mexico city, extortion is a far more immediate threat to the 6.1 million people estimated to use public transport daily. Historically considered one of the country's safer cities, the capital accounted for about a quarter of the 16,543 assaults that occurred on public transport nationally in 2018. Nearly all of these attacks ended with bloodshed. Of the 4,769 attacks on public transport within the the first six months of 2019, just 30 cases were non-violent. Yet criminals are rarely punished. Government data shows that 99 out of every 100 assaults on public transport in Mexico goes unreported. Authorities seem to recognize this. Government officials recently dedicated 6,600 police officers to protecting public transport, in addition to promising to install security cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking devices and panic buttons in public transit vehicles. In the meantime, as robberies become increasingly violent and deadly , some Mexico City transportation providers have temporarily suspended service. In the Central American countries of El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras , bus operators have tried similar tactics to protest attacks from street gangs, which have long extorted the public transport sector. But little has come from these efforts. Assaults of buses and taxis continue to take passengers' lives and make drivers' jobs some of the most dangerous in the world."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

"Mexico State Leads Country in Homicides as Govt Launches Intervention. Rising homicides, a high-level capture and a bloody military battle point to growing insecurity in Mexico State, which borders the capital, months after the federal government announced a plan to improve security in the state. Between January and May this year, Mexico State, known as Edomex (Estado de Mexico), has seen the greatest number of homicides, violent car thefts, extortion cases, rapes and bank robberies in the country, reported Vanguardia. The state, which is the most populous in the country, registered 838 homicides during the first five months of 2014 -- nearly 14 percent more than the same period in 2013 -- significantly higher than violent states such as Sinaloa, with 484 homicides, or Michoacan, with 464. Mexico State was also the site of the recent capture of a reported Familia Michoacana cartel leader. Mexican officials confirmed the arrest of Jose Maria Chavez Magana, alias ""El Pony,"" on July 2 and identified him as one of the individuals responsible for an increase in violence in some areas of the state. At the time of his arrest, Magana's group was allegedly embroiled in a fierce internal conflict in addition to fighting against the Knights Templar (Caballeros Templarios) and Guerreros Unidos criminal groups for control of the state. Magana had reportedly been in charge of the Familia Michoacana's criminal activities in Mexico State since October 2011. The violence in Mexico State has called the attention of the federal government, which announced a ""strategic plan"" in March to improve security in the state, including doubling the number of federal police. The federal government's engagement can be explained in part by the fact that President Enrique Pena Nieto was, until 2011, the governor of Mexico State. Earlier this week, current Governor Eruviel Avila said that violence had gotten out of hand and the state needed support from the federal security forces. The recent spike in violence in the state can be attributed to battles between rival cartels for control of the territory as criminal groups migrate from the neighboring states of Michoacan and Guerrero in response to security crackdowns there. Guerreros Unidos, a splinter group of the Beltran Leyva Organization, is one of the contributors to the insecurity. The group recently made international news when a battle with a military patrol left 22 members dead. According to BBC Mundo , Guerreros Unidos has only minor drug trafficking operations and relies mainly on kidnappings and extortion to generate profits. Unlike drug trafficking, these are inherently violent activities, which rely on widespread fear in order to make a profit."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Peru Capture Further Evidence of Italian Mafia Expansion in LatAm. Authorities in Peru have arrested an Italian accused of being a major cocaine trafficker for the 'Ndrangheta, further evidence of the growing reach of the Italian mafia into cocaine source countries and transshipment points across Latin America. Pasquale Bifulco, alias ""Spaghetti,"" was arrested in Lima following two years of investigations into his activities in the country. He is wanted by not only by the Italian authorities, but also those of Brazil and Spain, and is allegedly one of the principal cocaine providers for the 'Ndrangheta's European market, reported La Republica. In addition to reportedly leading operations that moved large amounts of cocaine from Peru and Brazil to Europe via cargo ships, authorities discovered through intercepted phone calls that Bifulco had bought a 35 percent stake in a gold and iron mine in Peru to launder drug money. According to La Republica, Bifulco's sister Florinda and his Peruvian girlfriend -- both of whom are under investigation -- headed up the financial end of his operations. Bifulco allegedly maintained operations in 12 countries, and had managed to evade capture on at least two recent occasions -- in January 2012, he was followed and nearly arrested in Rome, while an operation in March this year led to the detention of numerous of his collaborators, along with the seizure of over two tons of cocaine. The 'Ndrangheta, who authorities say are responsible for up to 80 percent of cocaine moved to Italy, have long had a presence in Colombia, where they collaborated with the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) in the 1990s and the Medellin Cartel before that. They have also developed significant business relationships with Mexico's cartels. Bifulco's arrest comes amid a number of signs that the 'Ndrangheta and their Sicilian counterparts, the Cosa Nostra, are expanding operations to other countries in the region. The brother of an alleged leader of the Cosca Alampi -- a smaller mafia group linked to the 'Ndrangheta -- was arrested in Ecuador last November , while a Cosa Nostra boss was apprehended in Venezuela in 2012. There have also been reports of an Italian mafia presence in the Dominican Republic since 2007 , and an alleged key 'Ndrangheta operative was recently captured on the island, which is a major cocaine transshipment nation. Meanwhile, the March operation that nearly caught Bifulco was the product of an investigation that had uncovered an 'Ndrangheta-led operation trafficking cocaine out of Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. By expanding into Peru and Brazil, the group could be looking to reduce the role of middlemen; if they operate throughout the region, they can secure product closer to the source and personally oversee trafficking through the various transshipment points."	1	0	1	0	0	0	1
"Juarez to House Police in Hotels After Cartel Threats. Juarez may spend $2 million to house the city's municipal police force in several hotels with heightened security, after a drug cartel appeared to be acting on threats to kill one police officer a day. Last week banners known as ""narcomantas"" began appearing throughout Ciudad Juarez, signed by a group calling itself the New Juarez Cartel, thought to be a faction of the Aztecas street gang operating under a new name. The banners accused Police Chief Julian Leyzaola of colluding with the New Juarez Cartel's rivals and vowed to kill one policeman per day until he either steps down or stops targeting the group. Eight Juarez policemen have been killed this month in increasingly brazen attacks, including one shoot-out which left three suspected hitmen dead. Juarez Mayor Hector Murguia came out in support of Leyzaola, claiming that he will leave office before he allows Leyzaola to step down. For his part, Leyzaola blamed Johnny Morales Gonzales, alias ""El Tin Tan,"" for the violence, urging citizens to turn the alleged New Juarez Cartel leader in. Leyzaola mistakenly distributed a photo of Morales, which later turned out to a potrait of a resident in El Paso, El Diario de Juarez reports. The city treasurer said they have set aside a 25 million peso budget (about $2 million) to house off-duty police in two hotels over the next 90 days, according to El Diario. The police are receiving a discounted rate on the rooms. A common tactic seen in Juarez is the assassination of police believed to be working for a rival cartel. Since the Sinaloa Cartel began open warfare against the Juarez Cartel for control of the city in 2008, a reported 175 municipal police officers have been killed. The public threats by the New Juarez Cartel seem like a new spin on this strategy. Their accusation that Leyzaola is working with another criminal group may just be a calculated bid to detract from Leyzaola's perceived legitimacy as one of Mexico's most effective police officials. But the threat has now increased the pressure on both Leyzaola and Juarez Mayor Hector Murguia to stem the killings; if they don't, they could be blamed for the loss of more police officers. These developments cast more doubt on the effectiveness of the police force. Police are supposed to protect the local population; diverting resources to ensure their security implies less protection for the citizens of Juarez. And with Juarez holding the title of the hemisphere's most dangerous city -- until it was recently surpassed by Hondras' San Pedro Sula -- its residents need all the security they can get.

"US Treasury Designations Point to Beltran Leyva Revival. The US Treasury has added two figures linked to the Beltran Leyva Organization to its ""Kingpin List,"" another sign the once ailing drug cartel is restoring its influence in Mexico. The Treasury designated Arnoldo Villa Sanchez and Miguel Loza Hernandez as specially designated narcotics traffickers (SDNT), along with security firm Sistemas Elite De Seguridad Privada, in which both men have shares. Villa, who also uses the name Erick Rene Calderon Sanchez, is the head of security for Hector Beltran Leyva, current leader of the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) and has carried out various acts of violence on his behalf, according to the press release. Loza, meanwhile, was singled out for his links to Villa and the security company. As a result of the decision, any assets owned by the men or company in the United States are frozen and US citizens are forbidden from doing business with them. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Director Adam Szubin said the designations come in the face of a ""resurgence"" of the BLO. These new designations reinforce the notion of the BLO's recent revival. Originally led by three brothers, Arturo, Hector and Alfredo Beltran Leyva, the once powerful allies of the Sinaloa Cartel had been reeling following the January 2008 arrest of Alfredo and December 2009 death of Arturo at the hands of Mexican marines. Alfredo's arrest caused an acrimonious split from the Sinaloa Cartel, while Arturo's death saw the group descend into disarray and infighting. However, Hector Beltran Leyva has gradually rebuilt the organization, forging strong links with the Zetas to battle a partnership of the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels. The BLO was thought to be instrumental in the Zetas' successful battle for the northern city of Monterrey -- a key drug trafficking territory. The organization has also never been eradicated from the Pacific coastal city of Acapulco, where an ongoing territorial war has claimed some 600 lives this year, according to state police sources consulted by InSight Crime. The BLO was also linked to an attack on CIA agents last year , while its reach seemingly extends beyond Mexico's borders, with Panamanian intelligence sources earlier this year naming it as one of four Mexican cartels operating in Panama."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Councilor Threats Reveal Perilous Democracy. Almost half of all Colombian councilors have reported threats over the course of the year, revealing the extremely fragile nature of Colombia's supposedly strong democracy. Edgar Polo Devia, executive director of the National Councilors Federation (Fenacon), announced that 5,300 of Colombia's 12,243 councilors had received threats in 2013, reported El Colombiano. Of those, just 2,800 are receiving government protection. One councilor who was being ""protected,"" Donaldo Sanchez Lizarazo, was fatally shot at a gas station under a fortnight ago, Polo pointed out, after reporting threats from guerrilla group the ELN. The assassination prompted a mass resignation of almost 80 other councilors in the department Arauca, where Sanchez worked, citing ""a lack of guarantees to be able to do our job."" A total of nine councilors have been killed so far this year. The national Protection Unit, created to provide protection for government officials, is ""negligent and apathetic,"" failing to even send condolences when a councilor was killed, said Carmen Lucia Agredo, president of Fenacon. ""We need answers,"" she said. ""We haven't received any kind of support."" At a meeting with US President Barack Obama in Cartagena last year, Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos spoke of his country's ""incredibly strong democracy () that has been recognized by the world as a whole."" Obama congratulated the ""incredible transformation of this nation."" The new Fenacon figures clearly demonstrate how misrepresentative such narratives really are. Colombia's democracy, long praised as one of Latin America's best, is in reality incredibly fragile. The nation has a decentralized political system in which regional councilors have significant control over federal state resources. As the basis of the democratic system at the local level, it is difficult to say democracy is flourishing when half of them are unable to do their job properly for fear of being assassinated. Worryingly, this figure represents a significant increase on last year, when by July just 10 percent of councilors had reported threats. Even during 2011, a regional election year making threats more likely, only around 3,500 councilors were threatened, according to Fenacon. Exactly who is behind the threats remains unclear, with many of the country's disparate illegal organizations focused on maintaining a firm grip over the territory where they operate. But what is clear is that Colombia's transformation into a modern democracy is very far from complete -- based on these figures it may even be going backwards."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Guatemala Election: Corruption Claims Bring Back Bad Memories. As Guatemala's elections approach, allegations of corruption have gathered around the UCN party. Such concerns are particularly worrying in a country awash with criminal groups, which have often enjoyed impunity thanks to their ties with those in power. The Union of National Change (Union del Cambio Nacional - UCN) has Mario Estrada as its candidate for the presidential election, set to be held in September. Allegations of misdeeds have been swirling around the party; in addition to Estrada's connections with disgraced former president Alfonso Portillo, a number of the UCN's candidates have been implicated in corruption scandals. According to Guatemala's Siglo XXI, Estrada is a major regional powerbroker in the eastern department of Jalapa, where he served as a legislator for the Guatemalan Republican Front (Frente Republicana Guatemalteca - FRG) from 1999 to 2006. During the second round of the 2007 presidential elections, Estrada's endorsement was instrumental in drumming up support for current President Alvaro Colom's campaign. In exchange, Colom appointed people close to Estrada as governors of Jalapa, Chiquimula and neighboring El Progreso departments. Controversially, Estrada has also been linked to former President Alfonso Portillo, who was recently tried for allegedly embezzling $15 million from the Defense Ministry's pension fund. Although he was acquitted in May , Portillo is still fighting an extradition order from the United States, where he is wanted on charges of money laundering and embezzlement of charity donations. During Portillo's time in office, he named Estrada to head the newly-created Secretariat of Social Development, a position that lasted only 10 months before it was closed amid corruption allegations. On top of this, the Guatemalan paper said it had discovered that Estrada owns a number of private corporations that exist only on paper (one of which is co-owned with Portillo); a favored tactic of money launderers. Estrada is not the only candidate with a questionable record that the Union of National Change (Union del Cambio Nacional - UCN) has backed. In the municipality of Villa Nueva, Salvador Gandara is the UCN mayoral pick, despite the fact that he has been jailed for money laundering charges. Although an electoral court recently banned him from officially registering as a candidate, the UCN has not given up on him, and continues to lobby for his release. While the UCN is not one of Guatemala's major political parties (according to a June poll published by Prensa Libre , Estrada has only 2.6 percent of the popular vote), these findings are important in that they highlight a deep and pervasive level of corruption, made worse by the weak state of the country's institutions. As InSight Crime has reported, the Guatemalan armed forces have admitted that some of their members trained and armed the Zetas , while the justice system is infamously defective. In a recent interview with Spain's El Pais , President Colom said that Guatemala was experiencing an ""invasion"" of foreign drug traffickers, and accused the two previous governments (led by Portillo and Oscar Berger, repectively) of colluding with criminal elements to ""hand the country over"" to criminals. As proof, Colom said that 12 military outposts in Peten, the embattled region currently being used by the Zetas as a major operations base, had been dismantled by the then-authorities in order to leave the way open for drugs to be transported into Mexico. He also claimed that the impunity enjoyed by the three major crime families in the country was a sign of their influence over Guatemala's political system. ""Everybody talked about the Lorenzanas, the Mendozas, the Ponces but nobody touched them. The impunity was total,"" said Colom. Still, Guatemalan authorities have made significant progress against the country's homegrown criminal groups this year. In March, top drug capo Juan Alberto Ortiz Lopez, alias ""Juan Chamale,"" was arrested in Quetzaltenango. A month later police captured Waldemar Lorenzana, who headed a criminal dynasty based in the west of the country. These arrests, combined with the rising threat from their Mexican competitors the Zetas, have placed increased pressure on these organizations to attempt to build political clout in the upcoming September 2011 election. As InSight Crime has reported , this campaign season has been stained by at least 20 political murders so far, a figure which is expected to climb as election day approaches. "	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
Cocaine Haul Shows Sophisticated Trafficking Route Through Honduras La Mosquitia. Authorities in Honduras arrested four Colombian citizens caught in an attempt to smuggle over 100 kilograms of cocaine into the United States through a remote region of the country's eastern coast, an example of increased drug flow through Honduras. Agents from Honduras' Technical Criminal Investigation Agency (Agencia Tecnica de Investigacion Criminal de Honduras - ATIC) seized 110 kilograms of cocaine and arrested the four suspects during an anti-drug sting in the department of Gracias a Dios, the Attorney General's Office announced in an April 6 press release. The four men, identified as Francisco Antonio Fuentes Arce, Clayton Humphries Brand, Will Hooker Rivera and Darwin Forbest Pacheco, fled in a motorboat and were pursued by Honduras navy personnel until they ran aground on a reef. The Colombians belonged to a transnational criminal structure while the shipment was to be received by a group based in Honduras, according to authorities. Further details about the groups behind this operation were not revealed. This trafficking operation was based in La Mosquitia, a region of dense rainforest and swamps, which is almost inaccessible by land. It extends along Honduras' Caribbean coast as far as Nicaragua and has been a strategic spot for the smuggling of drugs by plane and boat from South America to the United States. Criminals have used the remote area of La Mosquitia as a trafficking spot for years. But the role Honduras has played as an international drug-trafficking transit point has grown steadily in relation to the increase of Colombia's cocaine production. While South American narcos have exploited the Caribbean trafficking route for years, the cocaine corridor in Central America has been revitalized. As a result, countries like Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama are widening their role in the international drug trafficking. These increasingly important roles have also generated a rise in corruption among security forces and government officials. In Costa Rica, for example, security forces have been involved in the handling of their own drug trafficking networks. In Panama, drug smuggling groups depend on corrupt port officials to provide security in the drug shipments and hide illegal merchandise. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"US Helps Fight Trafficking of Natural, Cultural Resources in Mayan Jungle. The US Embassy in Guatemala City is hosting a workshop to help authorities from Guatemala, Mexico and Belize improve cooperation against the trafficking of natural resources and cultural artifacts from the Mayan jungle. Officials from the US Departments of State and the Interior, as well as the Agency for International Development, are working with their counterparts from the three countries on fighting the illegal trade in natural resources and cultural artifacts from the region, as Prensa Libre reports. Cynthia Perera of the Department of the Interior noted that the meeting was "" the first time that there has been a dialogue with reprensentatives of the agencies of environment, culture, prosecution, and police of these nations,"" according to another report from the newspaper. According to a 2010 presentation ( download .ppt ) by the US Ministry of the Interior, the Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala is threatened by a range of criminal activities, including illegal ranching, drug trafficking, human trafficking, and looting of archaeological sites. The report notes that the government of Guatemala has stepped up its efforts to combat these threats since 2009. The networks of artifact smugglers are sometimes connected to those of drug traffickers. In 2009, four Mexican and three Costa Rican citizens were implicated in a plot to smuggle cocaine hidden within panels of Egyptian marble. The panels were labeled as cardboard box tops when they entered Costa Rica. What's more, there is evidence that Mexican drug trafficking organizations have expanded their operations into the illicit trade in religious artifacts. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) estimates that the global illicit trade in cultural items is worth $8 billion a year. "	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"What an Ex-DEA Official Gets Wrong About Mexico. A former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) official says Mexico's next head of state should escalate President Felipe Calderon's fight against organized crime, but he addresses none of the justifiable sources of criticism of Calderon's approach. The message of Robert Bonner's op-ed , ""Cracking the Mexican Cartels,"" published in the New York Times on April 15, is clear: Calderon's strategy has proven extremely successful. Such a conclusion is at odds with much of the recent analysis of Mexico's crime policies, and indeed there are serious flaws in Bonner's logic. The first problem is that Bonner, who served as an administrator in the DEA under former President George H.W. Bush, views the situation in Mexico as a binary choice between winning and losing, stating early in his piece that ""Calderon has made huge gains toward defeating"" the gangs. The article makes multiple references to winning and losing, when in fact, in the military or athletic sense of the word, there will be neither victory nor defeat in Mexico. There will never be a decisive triumph over the drug gangs, nor are the criminals capable of or interested in defeating the government. For the foreseeable future, organized crime will always exist in Mexico, and the range of possible outcomes is not qualitatively different from today. Improving public security and imposing the rule of law is a permanent slog rather than a race to the end zone, and the perpetual goal is marginal improvement from one year to the next. Any analysis seeking signs of a decisive victory or defeat is necessarily flawed. Bonner cites several institutional reforms that supposedly illustrate Calderon's success, but this depiction is also misleading. Of the police, he writes: ""To win this war, Calderon needed cops he could rely on Fed up with the corruption of the AFI [Federal Investigations Agency], he abolished the agency in May 2009 and created an entirely new force under the secretary for public safety and security."" While there are certainly some promising elements to the recent improvements in the federal police, Bonner ignores that every Mexican president for a generation has embraced sweeping police reform. The AFI for example, was created under Calderon's predecessor. In its time, it was supposedly a permanent replacement to the corruption-riddled Federal Judicial Police. Simply creating a new police body is in no way the mark of a transformational president. Furthermore, while there were some purges of AFI commanders under Calderon, this was not an ""entirely new force,"" it was more like a reshuffling, with many of the old AFI rank and file continuing to serve under the new agency. Bonner goes on to say that one of the most significant oversights of Calderon's strategy is the lack of an aggressive asset-seizure program. But like many advocates who say fighting money laundering is the key to a safer Mexico, Bonner neglects to explain how this will decisively tilt the playing field against the drug traffickers. As InSight Crime has noted , a handful of factors make it unlikely that targeting dirty money will radically change the landscape. One problem is that the size of the drug trade relative to the economy as a whole is quite small. The most credible estimates for Mexico drug export revenue range between $4.7 and $8.1 billion, yet Mexico's GDP is roughly $1.2 trillion , and trade with the US measured $460 billion in 2011. Against this backdrop, with or without the proper legislation, the odds are always stacked against finding dirty money. And even conceding that asset-seizure programs could be more effective, taking several of his boats away won't suddenly make Joaquin Guzman, alias "" El Chapo ,"" a non-threat. Indeed, attacking his money and his assets only incentivizes further criminal activity. If a drug trafficker's profit margins drop from, say, 20 to 15 percent on the average shipment of cocaine, the rational gangster will look to recover that lost income by trafficking more or by engaging in other activities, from oil theft to extortion. In this sense, drug trafficking is fundamentally different from terrorism, which is often pointed to as a model for how cracking down on money laundering can bear fruit. Limiting terrorists' access to cash reduces their ability to pull off attacks. With drug traffickers, however, attacking their assets doesn't prevent them from otherwise harming society; the harm is already done once the money has been earned. In short, while there's nothing wrong with going after the gangsters' ""houses, ranches, airplanes, boats, vehicles, and otherwise legitimate businesses"", it's hard to see how it can be the ""essential element"" to a more effective approach, and could even perversely incentivize further crime. Bonner has long been a vocal proponent of the so-called ""kingpin strategy ,"" through which the government targets the leading figures in the most notorious groups. He once more voices support for such an approach in his op-ed, saying that Calderon ""has waged an increasingly effective campaign against the cartels by employing what is known as the kingpin strategy, which Colombia used to defeat its drug cartels in the 1990s."" While arresting wealthy and violent gangsters is a necessary function of any effective police force, this alone is not enough. Unfortunately, Bonner makes little mention of the insufficiency of this approach, nor its negative side effects. Contrary to his assertion, kingpins are frequently easily replaceable, and the gang that suffers the loss rebounds without much upset. Meanwhile, the decline of one group, be it the Medellin Cartel or La Linea, inevitably leads to its replacement by others. As many analysts have pointed out, this process, for which there are literally scores of examples, is necessarily destabilizing and typically violent. Bonner points to Colombia as an example of the kingpin strategy successfully deployed, yet close to 13,500 people were killed in 2011 , good enough for a murder rate of roughly 30 per 100,000 residents. In Medellin, the supposed site of a historic public security miracle brought about in part because of the application of the kingpin approach, more than 1,600 people were killed in 2011, a larger figure than in Juarez. In contrast, Mexico, for all its notorious travails with criminal groups, had a rate of about 20 murders per 100,000 residents last year. If Colombia's ""victory"" is actually a model for Mexico and not just a convenient comparison, why is the state of public security in the former nation so precarious? Bonner's piece has other weaknesses, but most glaring is that he makes no mention of Mexico's recent spike in violence whatsoever, though he does refer dismissively to the ""negative headlines"" early in the piece. His point seems to be that the violence receives too much attention, and that bloodshed notwithstanding, Calderon's strategy has proven very effective. But while may be an easy argument to make while living in Washington, the case is rather more difficult to make in Juarez, Acapulco, or Torreon, and Bonner never examines the counter to his point. The two perennial goals in security policy -- in a nutshell, weaker gangs and safer streets -- are often in conflict, and reasonable people can disagree as to which of the two is more important in a given moment. However, no reasonable analysis entirely ignores either objective, which is precisely what Bonner has done here. As far as we can tell from his piece, spikes in violence don't matter, period. Given that the historic increases in murder, extortion, kidnapping, and other crimes in Mexico provoke no self-reflection from Bonner, it's worth asking if there even exists a threshold at which Bonner would begin to question the soundness of Calderon's approach. It appears that there is not, which, to anyone who has followed Mexico with an objective set of eyes over the past five years, is simply baffling. "	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
Uruguay Set for Record Homicide Rate in 2012. Uruguay is on course for its most violent year on record, according to a new report, suggesting that organized crime may be increasing its presence in one of Latin America's historically more peaceful countries. The Proposal Foundation (Fundacion Propuesta - FP), an organization that monitors security in Uruguay, released figures putting the country on course for a homicide rate of 9.19 per 100,000 in 2012. This marks a jump from 6.27 per 100,000 last year, and means that 2012 will be Uruguay's most violent year on record, reported EFE. Nearly half of the 259 homicides so far this year were the result of fights, assaults and robberies, according to the FP, which collects its statistics from press reports of killings throughout the country. While a homicide rate of less than 10 per 100,000 people is still low for the region -- neighboring Brazil had a rate of 21 per 100,000 in 2010, for example -- the jump of nearly 50 percent in a year is cause for alarm. What's more, given that the FP collects its statistics from newspaper reports, it is possible that the real figure could be higher. In January, InSight Crime noted that a spate of gang shootouts and murders in Montevideo pointed to increased organized criminal activity in the country, with officials admitting their concern over rising violence, which they attributed to warring drug gangs. According to the US State Department, drug traffickers from Colombia, Mexico and Bolivia are increasingly using Uruguay as a transit point for narcotics. Uruguayan officials are also concerned that Brazilian gangs may be using their country as a haven from the attention of Brazilian authorities, and that criminal organizations may even be shifting cocaine production operations to the country. It was recently announced that the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) would re-open its office in Uruguay , 18 years after it was closed, underscoring the country's growing importance in the international narcotics trade.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Mexico City Airport Shooting Suspects Claim Conspiracy. Two of the three fugitive suspects in last month's shoot-out between federal police at Mexico City airport have claimed that it was the officers who died, not them, who were part of a drug trafficking ring. The two fugitives, Daniel Cruz Garcia and Zeferino Morales Franco, contacted Proceso to give their version of the story. They contend that the other officers had, over the course of several months, attempted to coerce them into joining the trafficking ring. According to the men, the commander of the federal police in the airport tried to persuade them to join, telling them he was asking on behalf of the regional head of the federal police, Luis Cardenas Palomino. The two officers claim that they refused to participate, and the pressure turned into direct threats, especially after they said they would report it to their superiors. According to Cruz and Morales, the threats culminated in the June 25 shootout. They claim that the three officers, including their direct superior, Enrique de Jesus Pacheco Valdez, approached them in the food court in Terminal 2, and the ensuing confrontation boiled over when one of the others shot Morales in the leg. According to Morales, the third fugitive suspect, Bogard Felipe Lugo de Leon, was on shift at the time of the argument and came over to tell the group to calm down, unaware of the nature of the disagreement. Cruz Garcia and Morales Franco accept responsibility for the deaths of the other officers, but deny any charges related to drug trafficking. They told Proceso that they planned to turn themselves in after a full investigation has been carried out, but not to the Federal Police, in whom they have lost trust. Authorities claim the three suspects were among more than 180 people identified as part of an 18-month investigation of cartel operations in the airport. According to their account, on June 25, the three officers who died were attempting to arrest the suspects in the food court when the shooting broke out. At a press conference, Cardenas presented video evidence of an agent identified as Morales spending 11 minutes in the bathroom that morning near the arrivals gate of a flight from Lima, and exiting with a package under his jacket, which they claim was filled with cocaine. Cruz and Morales raise some interesting questions about in the official story. Firstly, they maintain that on the day of the shooting their boss, Pacheco, turned up at the airport in civilian clothes and carrying a gun, even though he was supposed to be on vacation. They also contend that an operation to arrest two armed federal officers identified in a counter-trafficking operation would involve more than just three officers. Finally, they point out that no surveillance camera captured the shooting, despite the fact that there are 430 closed-circuit cameras in Terminal 2. The airport in Mexico City is an important hub for international trafficking. As InSight has reported , it is easy for traffickers to hide illicit shipments, including methamphetamine precursors and cocaine, among the annual 28 million passengers and 409,000 tons of cargo. 	1	1	0	1	0	0	0
"In Lead Up to World Cup, Govt Reports Fall in Murders in Pacified Rio Favelas. Statistics from Rio de Janeiro's Police Pacification Units (UPP) show a fall in the murder rates in the shantytowns where they have a presence, but some other crimes have increased. According to statistics released by Brazil's Institute of Public Security (ISP) and the Pacification Police of Rio de Janeiro Coordination on 30 of the city's so-called ""favelas"" where the UPP operate, the number of homicides between 2012 and 2013 dropped 26.5 percent from 36 to 49, reported Folha de Sao Paulo. Aggravated assault also decreased 14 percent. Nevertheless, street theft went up by 7 percent to 213 cases registered in 2013, while car theft rose by 5.8 percent. The number of drug seizures also increased by 23.2 percent. It's hard to know why some crimes go up while others go down, but for Rio, this could be a good sign. In the best scenario, it means that petty crime is replacing larger criminal operations. In the worst scenario, it is a temporary lull. The UPPs have been a controversial topic since their inception in 2008. Though welcomed by some, their widespread use of excessive violence has provoked mass protests among citizens and international reprobation. The ISP has also reported that the number of police-related deaths rose 69 percent between 2013 and 2014, while 80 percent of Brazilians would fear torture under arrest, according to Amnesty International. There have also been steady reports of street crime being on the rise. According to official figures, in 2013 muggings in Rio de Janeiro went up 19 percent compared to the previous year, including a 49 percent rise in tourist areas. But the pacification project has also been credited with a 65 percent drop in homicides and doing something that no previous program ever had: creating a permanent police presence in the favelas. Still, there are complaints that there is little to no policing at night. What's more, as InSight Crime highlighted in a recent report , Brazil has failed to address the social problems at the core of crime. Some critics go further , claiming that the recent boost in the state's security efforts is merely a public relations stunt ahead of the World Cup."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Extortion Shuts Down 1/3 of Businesses in Honduran Capital. Extortion has reportedly forced 30 percent of small businesses in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa to close, demonstrating the economic cost of insecurity in the country. According to an El Heraldo report, 30 percent of Tegucigalpa's small businesses -- some 10,800 -- active in the beginning of 2012 have closed due to frequent threats from criminals attempting to extort money. Some business owners have elected to move to Nicaragua, where they believe the government does a better job of providing security, reported El Heraldo, whose survey showed that there is a general distrust of the police in Tegucigalpa. Some Hondurans worry that corrupt police officers might even be assisting criminals in extortion schemes making victims hesitant to come forward to police for fear of retaliation. Tegucigalpa's Deputy Police Commissioner Elvis Bonilla Andara explained to the newspaper that steps have been taken to make reporting the crime easier. According to Bonilla Andara, Hondurans can now make complaints anonymously via telephone, a policy that has helped police to capture five alleged extortioners so far in July. In an attempt to combat extortion nationwide, the Honduran government passed legislation in March that increased prison terms for the crime from nine years to 20 years, making the penalty one of the highest in the region for extortion. Honduran security forces also launched an operation that month to patrol the most dangerous bus and taxi routes to help protect drivers from extortion gangs. Other Central American countries struggle similarly with the crime. In Guatemala, police arrested seven people in June for allegedly extorting close to $500,000 from bus drivers in the capital. This phenomenon reached such levels in El Salvador that bus drivers went on strike in August 2011 to put pressure on their government to increase security against gangs' extortion demands. Extortion is not just a threat to security, but to development as well. El Heraldo's report notes that extortion has adverse long term effects on the Honduran economy, causing rising bankruptcy, unemployment, and capital flight. 	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Mexico Sees Many Captures, Few Trials. More than 70 percent of all federal arrests in Mexico never reach trial, highlighting deficiencies in the justice system which are at least as important as issues like police firepower when it comes to tackling organized crime. Mexico's Attorney General's Office (Procuraduria General de la Republica - PGR) released a report earlier this week saying that authorities were able to bring to trial only 28 percent of federal arrests in 2010, reports Excelsior. The rest of the more than 106,000 people detained went free. In a majority of these cases, this was due to insufficient evidence against the accused, or cases that were sloppily put together. The PGR report highlights serious problems with the criminal justice system, both in the ""ministerios publicos"" which head up investigations and prosecutions, and in the judges who decide criminal cases. The integrity of these officials has been called into question on numerous occasions in recent years, and other examples of institutional incapacity abound. One famous case is the so-called ""michoacanazo,"" the mass arrest of dozens of state and municipal politicians in the state of Michoacan in 2009. The arrests were hailed at the time as a historic step forward in attacking official corruption, but, by early this year, every single one of them had been released from custody without charges. Cases related to organized crime -- from drug trafficking to possession of military grade weapons -- are typically dealt with in the federal system, so its shortcomings have serious implications for the government's ongoing war against drug cartels. Despite the evident bottlenecks in the judicial system, much analysis of Mexican public security issues has, in recent years, focused on the supposed firepower and hardware gap between law enforcement and drug gangs. For the most part, the difference is exaggerated. The Mexican armed forces have tanks, artillery, fighter jets, and warships; drug gangs do not. But the perception persists. For this reason, American aid via the Merida Initiative has focused primarily on outfitting Mexican agencies with top-of-the-line gadgetry, from Bell helicopters to CASA coastal patrol planes. Helped by all this technology, the number of arrests on drug charges has spiked during the Calderon presidency, a fact often pointed to as a sign of his government's dedication to tackling organized crime. According to government figures released in February, 30,000 people have been arrested in Mexico for drug charges since Calderon's term began in December 2006. But, of course, a massive increase in the number of arrests means very little if the state can't convict them. (Indeed, such a cycle is arguably worse than failing to apprehend anyone in the first place, in that the arrests concentrate dangerous criminals in short-term facilities ill-equipped to handle them, thus creating anarchic ""universities of crime."") Calderon has made a similar point in the past. Last year, for instance, he complained, with a heavy dose of sarcasm, of the crumbling michoacanazo, ""Now it turns out that nobody has done anything here, nothing is wrong; now it turns out that everything is just fine."" Some of those arrested for federal offenses and then released without trial have gone on to commit notorious crimes. One recent alleged example is Julian Zapata, a suspected Zeta who, following his 2008 arrest and subsequent release in 2010 for lack of evidence, stands accused of participating in the shooting death of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Jaime Zapata in February. The hallmark effort to address this bottleneck in the criminal justice system was the 2008 judicial reform, which established provisions for the presumption of innocence and oral, public trials. However, many elements of the reform, which is to be implemented over an eight-year period through 2016, have been limited both by spending cuts and rampant insecurity. Mexico's focus on improving police technology and capacity to track and capture criminals should not come at the expense of the slower work of building institutions. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Are Foreign Criminal Gangs Driving Honduras Land Conflict?A bloody and long-running land dispute in Honduras has claimed dozens of lives, and some parties to the conflict claim that drug traffickers and foreign armed groups are involved. Violence broke out in Bajo Aguan, a region that lies in the northeastern provinces of Colon and Yoro, when 11 people died in two incidents in mid-August. Like so much about the conflict in that region, the facts of the deaths are unclear -- in the first incident, the government said that six private security guards were killed in an attack by a group of armed peasants who were attempting to take over a farm. The next day, five civilians were apparently murdered in a revenge attempt, despite having no connection to the land reform movement. Days later, Secundino Ruiz, head of the Authentic Peasant Protest Movement of Aguan (MARCA) was shot by masked men riding a motorbike. They made off with a large sum of money he was carrying, causing officials to say it was probably a robbery. However, the style of the attack, combined with the current highly charged situation in Bajo Aguan and the victim's place as leader of a prominent land reform movement, suggest that it was more likely a hired kill. The next day, the vice-president of another peasant body, the Unified Peasant Movement of Aguan (MUCA), and his wife were gunned down in their house, providing further backing to the theory of that the killings were linked to the struggle for land. The region has been in the throws of a violent land conflict for more than two years. Some 37 people have died since December 2009, 15 of them guards and 17 peasants, according to newspaper El Heraldo. Peasant organizations date the roots of the conflict back to the early 1990s, when change to the law temporarily made it legal for landowners to buy up large tracts of land -- a previous law had banned the ownership of more than 300 hectares. Honduran businessman Miguel Facusse, owner of the company Exportadoras del Atlantico, took the opportunity to purchase thousands of hectares of palm oil farms from peasant cooperatives that had run the land since a previous reform process in the 1960s. In 2009, MUCA claimed that the sale had been illegitimate and demanded the return of the territory, first through legal channels and then by occupying the farms, which they held from December 2009 to February 2010. In June 2011, after more than a year of talks, Honduran President Porfirio Lobo announced that he had reached a solution to bring an end to the crisis, with a plan to purchase more than 4,000 hectares of palm oil cultivation from Facusse and grant it to peasant organizations. This deal has reportedly fallen through following the latest round of violence. Now the government has sent in another round of reinforcements, bringing the number of troops and police officers in the region to 1,000, and says they will remain there permanently. Local authorities, and the national government, have gone to great lengths to pin the conflict on outsiders and link the peasants to organized crime. The commander of the army taskforce sent into the area blamed ""infiltrators"" from Venezuela and Nicaragua who, he said, had come to the region arm and train the peasants, while Colon police chief Julio Benitez suggested that the groups might in fact be criminal gangs ""using the name of the peasants."" These allegations have been floating for some time; in February 2010 a leaked intelligence report, seen by newspaper La Prensa , said the peasant groups had ""support from leftist movements, training from Colombian guerrillas, and strategic funding from narco-traffickers."" Security Minister Oscar Alvarez said after the most recent round of violence that, ""These groups call themselves peasants [but] may be groups of drug traffickers who want to establish themselves in this region and scare people away."" The head of the armed forces, Rene Osorio Canales, threw another nation into the mix, suggesting that Salvadorans could also be involved in fomenting violence in the region. The evidence for these multi-national conspiracy theories is at best sketchy. Drug traffickers are certainly a powerful presence in Colon, but other reports have tied them to palm oil plantation owners, rather than to the peasant movements. The state, located on the Caribbean coast close to Nicaragua, is a key transit location for trafficking groups moving drugs from South America towards Mexico and the U.S. A statement released by representatives of the Catholic Church in Honduras said that drug traffickers are in the process of becoming big landowners in the region, and that they dominate Bajo Aguan, flaunting their wealth. Similarly, the palm oil landowners have themselves been accused of using foreign firepower, with allegations after a series of killings in November 2010 that Facusse had hired 150 Colombian paramilitaries to form a private army and attack the peasant movements. Land conflicts in other parts of Latin America, driven by the accumulation of land to grow monocrops such as palm oil, have tended to feature organized criminal groups on the side of big landowners, rather than on the side of the peasants. In the 1990s and 2000s Colombia saw mass displacements carried out by paramilitary groups, who would remove peasants from their land on behalf of big agribusinesses like palm oil. Palm oil, which comes from African palm trees, has long been a profitable crop, used in food products. Demand has surged in the last decade, as it has become popular as a source of clean energy. In the two decades since 1990, the area under palm oil cultivation worldwide went up 43 percent. This has made it even more profitable to plant vast plots of the trees in countries across Latin America, often worsening the situation in areas already in dire need of land reform. One of the things driving the massive displacement of small-scale farmers within Colombia was the influx of drug money as the country became a world hub for narco-trafficking in the 1980s. Land ownership was a convenient way to launder vast sums of dirty money, as well as to help a gangster with aspirations to take a step up the social ladder. In Honduras, where land reform has a long and dark history, and where drug gangs are increasingly moving to grab power and influence, the situation could be just as explosive. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Narco-Jet Deliberate Plot Against Me: Chinchilla. Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla has suggested the scandal surrounding her use of a jet linked to a Colombian drug trafficking suspect could be revenge for her attempts to push legislation allowing for the extradition of suspected Costa Rican criminals. Revelations last week that Chinchilla flew to former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's funeral and to a wedding in Peru on a private jet loaned by Gabriel Morales Fallon -- a Colombian who is under investigation by Costa Rican authorities for possible involvement in drug trafficking and by Colombian authorities for money laundering -- seriously embarrassed the president and led to the resignation of her security chief, communications minister and a senior aide. President Chinchilla told Colombian newspaper El Tiempo Wednesday that she had been let down by her security team, who had ""not asked the questions they were obliged to ask"" and had exposed her to risk, while pointing out that all allegations remained unconfirmed. Referring to a recent El Tiempo report revealing an agreement between the US Drug Enforcement Administration and Colombian authorities to relocate Morales to Costa Rica in return for information on criminal activity, Chinchilla said, ""These facts have come out after I announced, with great determination, something that no one has ever dared do in Costa Rica: push for the extradition of Costa Ricans wanted by international justice."" Asked if the situation could have been engineered as a reprisal, she said she would ""not rule out any hypothesis. ""I can't confirm it, but I want to say to anyone who thinks that this will frighten me, because it is going to affect my image, what you are doing is the opposite."" Speaking to Colombian television network RCN on Tuesday, Morales denied any criminal activity and said he had no links to Chinchilla. ""I do not know the President of Costa Rica, I have not seen her personally, I have not spoken to her personally,"" he said. The jet had been loaned to public figures and politicians from other countries, including some from Colombia, he added. This does not look good. Either she did not know it was his airplane, which is bad. Or she did know, which is worse. President Chinchilla has made fighting organized crime a priority, as Costa Rica continues to grow in importance as a transit nation on international drug trafficking routes. Her latest moves to push for extradition legislation, increase prison terms for organized crime and make it easier for mysterious assets to be confiscated - proposals she has described as an ""act of bravery"" - could have persuaded some that is it time for her to go, making the theory of a trap and/or a smear campaign plausible. There is also a lot of extradition history in Latin America to consider. Most famously, the Medellin cartel led by Pablo Escobar waged a violent campaign against the implementation of an extradition treaty between Colombia and the United States during the 1980s. This year, two high-profile killings in Honduras have sparked fears a similar crusade is being launched there, where the government has taken steps to institute extradition."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Businessmans Release Points to Texis Cartel Impunity. A Salvadoran businessmen with links to the Texis Cartel has once again escaped punishment after his possession of illegal arms case was dismissed on a legal technicality, suggesting corrupt state institutions continue to protect El Salvador's criminal elite. Charges against Leonel Sandoval were dropped after a court ruled that he could not be tried for having an illegal arsenal of weapons because the arms were discovered while police executed a search warrant for documents pertaining to suspect business transactions, reported La Prensa Grafica. The case dates back to 2010, when a raid on Sandoval's house uncovered rifles, grenades and ammunition, including weapons legally reserved for the use of the armed forces. After posting $100,000 bail, Sandoval technically went on the run, not presenting himself at court appearances. However in reality, he was still conducting his business and living in his home. Sandoval was rearrested in June 2013 , but in August, a local court ruled the evidence collected was inadmissible as the weapons were not the target of the warrant. This ruling was overturned by a regional court and the case was sent to trial. However, with the trial court now deciding to uphold the original decision, Sandoval has walked free. The name of Leonel Sandoval appeared in the first investigations into the Texis Cartel -- one of El Salvador's most powerful criminal organizations, which is run by influential businessmen. The Texis Cartel's main activities are not related directly to moving drugs but more focused on laundering money. Sandoval is believed to have aided in this activity through real estate deals. Many of Sandoval's property deals raised suspicions, but investigations have made little progress -- likely because many of Sandovals dealings involved high ranking police and judiciary officials. Sandoval's web of influential contacts extends to his attorney, Manuel Chacon, who rose to prominence in getting dismissed the case of one of the country's top police officials, who was caught on video participating in a bank robbery in which eight people died. Chacon was a leading advisor to former Security and Justice Minister and current Minster for Defense, Daivd Munguia, whose term in his previous role was marked by a near complete absence of investigations into the Texis Cartel. ""This doesn't come as a surprise to me that this guy is now free because the cover of impunity of the Texis Cartel is so wide it has even been recognized by the United Nations,"" said Hector Silva, InSight Crime's El Salvador investigator. ""Yet again this is a show of impunity in my country"""	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
"El Salvadors Peaceful Month Not Due to Bukele Security Plan. Despite being one of the world's most violent countries, El Salvador enjoyed one of its most peaceful months in years in July, but President Nayib Bukele may be far too early in taking the credit. With a rate of five homicides per day, or 154 in total, July 2019 was the country's second least violent month of the 21 st century, only behind April 2013 with 143 homicides, according to police data cited in El Faro. Since January 2001, an average month in El Salvador has seen just over 300 killings. The country even capped off the month with a murder-free day on July 31, which has only happened eight times in the last 19 years. The last time was on January 13, 2017. Nayib Bukele, El Salvador's recently-inaugurated president, has been quick to attribute this success to his new security plan. That plan , known as the Territorial Control Plan (Plan Control Territorial), aims to boost military and police presence in areas under gang control, and is viewed by some as a return to the hardline policies implemented by past administrations. ""To be honest, we didn't expect the reduction to be so quick and so large,"" he told El Faro , although he admitted other factors had probably also had an impact. The decrease in the nation's elevated homicide rate marks the continuation of a trend which has seen a steady drop in killings since 2016. In the first half of 2019, El Salvador recorded 1,407 murders - a 12.2 percent reduction on the previous year. Although Bukele is claiming responsibility for the drop-off in killings, it is far too early to credit his recently implemented security plan for this success. His new strategy came into force on June 20 and this latest drop in El Salvador's homicide rate marks the continuation of a downward trend lasting several years. On the contrary, Bukele's apparent penchant for hardline security policies , known locally as ""mano dura,"" could undo El Salvador's recent progress in lowering its homicide count. Bukele's plan came into force on June 20 and centers on sending military and police forces to the streets to retake gang-controlled municipalities. So far, the president has ordered the deployment of 3,000 military troops to support security operations. The president initially promised to present a more complete security plan, but his proposals for tackling gang violence have thus far focused on tough measures - a staple of previous administrations. These strategies have repeatedly failed to make an impact in El Salvador, instead contributing to increasing violence. Bukele has also raised eyebrows by appointing police chiefs with a history of repression. The new director of the National Police (Policia Nacional Civil - PNC), Mauricio Arriaza Chicas, has previously been investigated by Salvadoran authorities for suspected human rights abuses, and during the prior administration oversaw special police units which reportedly contained gang extermination units. In addition, it is difficult for the government's statistics to be taken at face value after it recently announced that it would no longer register homicides resulting from confrontations between security forces and suspected gang members. Though the government appears to have backtracked on this policy by including 22 homicides committed by state security forces in July's figures, the announcement has sparked concerns that the state may seek to artificially reduce the country's homicide rate, or hide potential abuses committed by its security forces."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
El Salvador, Bolivia Have LatAms Most Overcrowded Prisons. According to a new report on hemispheric security released by the Organization of American States (OAS) El Salvador, Bolivia and Haiti have the most overcrowded prisons in the hemisphere. On October 1, the OAS Hemispheric Observatory released the 2012 Report on Citizen Security in the Americas (pdf) , a comprehensive analysis of government data on crime and violence in the hemisphere. One of the variables studied in the report is the issue of overcrowding, an unfortunate feature of penal systems across Latin America. The issue has attracted much attention recently in Venezuela , Mexico and Honduras , which have all seen prison riots with multiple casualties, blamed at least in part on the lack of adequate space for inmates. Surprisingly, however, none of these countries are among the top three Latin American nations with the most crowded prisons. According to the data for 32 countries in the region, at the top of the list is El Salvador (whose prisons are filled at 299 percent their official capacity), Bolivia (233 percent) and Haiti (218 percent). The reasons for prison overcrowding are complex, with budget restraints, tough anti-gang laws and high use of pre-trial detention contributing to the problem in countries across the region. All three conditions are in place in El Salvador, where decades of neglect have made the country's prisons recruiting grounds and operation centers for street gangs. While the report's figures are self-reported by OAS member states, and are thus subject to tampering for political reasons, they allow for interesting comparisons and suggest that overcrowding, in itself, may not be directly linked to prison violence. For instance, while official figures for 2010 cite Mexico's prisons as being occupied at 122 percent of their official capacity, the prison occupancy rate in the Dominican Republic (where the penitentiary system has gained praise as a model for others in the region ) for the same year was 183 percent.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Dominican Narco Alleges Ex-President Took Drug Money. One of the Dominican Republic's most notorious drug traffickers has claimed he financed the political campaigns of former president Leonel Fernandez in new revelations that go to the heart of connections between drugs and politics in the country. In comments to TV news program Hilando Fino, former Dominican army captain and convicted drug trafficker Quirino Ernesto Paulino Castillo claimed he financed the 2002 and 2004 election campaigns of ex-President Fernandez, who he said owes him nearly $4.5 million, reported El Nacional. ""He knew who I was and he knew the money I was giving him for his campaign was dirty,"" Paulino told journalist Salvador Holguin. Paulino also claimed he paid for a $200,000 power plant as a donation to Fernandez's Global Democracy and Development Foundation (FUNGLODE). The interview followed the publication of a letter Paulino sent to Fernandez, who left the president's office in 2012, but remains head of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD). In the letter , Paulino demanded the repayment of a $222,000 loan and criticized Fernandez for accepting his money then later approving his extradition to the United States. Paulino was released from a US prison last year after serving a reduced sentence for collaborating with the US authorities. He was extradited in 2005 after he was caught with 1.3 tons of cocaine he was planning to ship to the United States. The accusations made by Paulino are the latest twist in a case that has revealed the depths of corruption in the Dominican Republic and the level to which drug trafficking has infiltrated state institutions and politics. At the time of his rise in drug trafficking, Paulino was not only an army captain; he had also been working as a regional campaign manager and was a major donor for Fernandez's electoral rival, ex-President Hipolito Mejia. When Paulino was arrested, police also captured a lieutenant colonel from the national police , who was travelling in the cocaine-laden vehicle with him. While Paulino was captured over a decade ago, his alleged former allies are still heavyweights in the world of Dominican politics. Meanwhile, more recent scandals, such as allegations that the country's anti-narcotics police have been operating as a drug trafficking organization, suggest corruption is still endemic in the security forces."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Argentina Bust Points to Lucrative Underworld Art, Artifacts Trade. Argentina's authorities captured two separate contraband traders moving historic artifacts and stolen artworks across the Argentine-Uruguay border in a sign that the underworld art trade continues to thrive. The suspects -- who were captured by the Argentine customs agency (known by its acronym AFIP) in separate vehicles at a prominent border crossing -- were moving ancient books, weapons, musical instruments and paintings, among other items, Clarin reported. At least three of the books were printed by Jesuit missionaries in the 17 th Century; the artwork was more recent and included items from the Lebanese artist Bibi Zogbe?s collection of paintings, La Nacion said. Authorities believe the artifacts and art were headed to Europe via Montevideo, Clarin added. While seemingly only impacting elite collectors and museums, the underworld trade in art and artifacts is hardly benign. Drug traffickers long ago discovered the utility of laundering money through the purchase and sale of black market art. And gunrunners, among others, use it as collateral for weapons deals. One of the more infamous of these underworld figures was Fidel Castano. Castano created a feared right-wing paramilitary organization that was the precursor to the United Self-defense Groups of Colombia (AUC), and he was one of the founders of the organization known as People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar (PEPES), the paramilitary group that helped authorities track and eventually kill Pablo Escobar in December 1993. Castano was also an avid collector of paintings and sculptures. One of his favorites was the Ecuadorean artist Oswaldo Guayasamin, who he commissioned to paint his portrait. (See below) Castano -- who also owned vast numbers of cattle and had his hands in numerous other businesses -- once told his underworld cohorts that trafficking art was more lucrative than drug trafficking. While this claim is probably a stretch, the black market of art and artifacts is significant. And in this highly inter-connected modern world, the $6 billion trade in artifacts and stolen artwork shows little sign of abating in the Americas. From Peru?s patrimonial artifacts to Guatemala?s religious art , there is no shortage of contraband to be traded. Castano?s fate, much like the paintings he trafficked, remains a mystery. While his younger brother, Carlos, said that Fidel was killed in an ambush by leftist rebels, others claim he is still alive and living in Portugal , where he is supposedly an art dealer.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Colombia: Illegal Mining Should be Treated Like Drug Trafficking. Colombia's mining and energy minister said unlicensed mining ""should be given the same treatment as drug trafficking,"" due to the connections between armed groups and the mining trade. In an interview with El Tiempo , Minister Mauricio Cardenas said that police should destroy the machinery confiscated from unlicensed mines, in the same way that police destroy cocaine laboratories. In some mining-rich areas of Colombia, groups like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) are known to tax mining equipment. The typical fee in northern Antioquia is at least 3 million pesos (about $1,650) for each machine that enters the FARC's territory. As mapped by InSight Crime , in other parts of the country criminal groups like the Rastrojos are known to tax production on the gold or coltan mines they control. Colombia is currently seeing an oil and mining boom, with some 9,500 mining and energy exploration bids currently awaiting approval of their environmental license, Cardenas said. "	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"US Arrests Honduras Elite for Allegedly Laundering Corruption Proceeds. The US arrest of a man tied to a graft scheme involving one of Honduras' largest government institutions is a clear sign of the limits to Washington's leniency with its regional allies as well as a demonstration of the Honduran government's inability to prosecute corrupt elites. On May 1, the US Justice Department announced the arrest of Carlos Zelaya, who is accused of conspiring to launder more than $1 million from bribes and misappropriated funds from the Honduran Social Security Institute (Instituto Hondureno de Seguridad Social - IHSS). His brother, Mario Zelaya, the former president of the social security institute from 2010 to 2014, during the presidency of Porfirio Lobo, was arrested in September 2016 near the Honduras-Nicaragua border after living as a fugitive for seven months. In 2017, he was convicted of a series of crimes in connection with the embezzlement of more than $300 million from the IHSS, according to a report by La Prensa. Carlos Zelaya is accused of conspiring with his brother to launder more than $1.3 million through international electronic transfers that he then used to purchase property in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he had been living. Part of this money could be the product of a series of bribes paid by two Honduran business leaders to Mario Zelaya when he ran the IHSS. Carlos Zelaya is also suspected of having used his brother's position to benefit from lucrative Honduran government contracts and to have laundered that money in New Orleans as well. The bribes occurred during the administration of former President Porfirio Lobo, whose son, Fabio Lobo, was sentenced to 24 years in US prison for drug trafficking in September 2017. Moreover, Porfirio Lobo's wife, Rosa Elena Bonilla de Lobo, was detained in Honduras in February on charges including misappropriation of public funds, money laundering and conspiracy. In the US case against Fabio Lobo, Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, the leader of drug trafficking group known as the Cachiros, named former President Porfirio Lobo in his testimony. According to a report by El Heraldo, Rivera testified that the Cachiros gave the senior Lobo up to $500,000 in exchange for various favors, but the ex-president has yet to face charges in Honduras. Carlos Zelaya's arrest in New Orleans on money laundering charges illustrates the complex position the United States has had to adopt when its allies fail to bring successful corruption cases against their political elites -- particularly when those individuals go on to commit crimes in US territory. After learning of the arrest, the top US diplomat in Honduras, Heide Fulton, tweeted that the United States ""will not be a refuge for those who intend to flee from justice in Honduras, nor will [its] financial system be used to launder funds stolen from the Honduran people."" The Attorney General's Office in Honduras began its investigation into the IHSS at the end of 2013, later revealing that leadership within the National Party (Partido Nacional) of current President Juan Orlando Hernandez received at least $90 million from the institute via more than 10 ghost companies. As InSight Crime has reported , after Hernandez admitted in 2015 that businesses linked to the IHSS embezzlement had financed his campaign, massive protests took the country by storm. These protests were one of the main precursors to the creation of the Support Mission Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (Mision de Apoyo contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad en Honduras - MACCIH). However, despite accusations of links between his inner circle and organized crime, Hernandez is one of the US government's closest allies in the region. In fact, the United States supported Hernandez when his reelection at the end of 2017 was plagued by allegations of fraud and violent political repression. Meanwhile, the MACCIH has faced a series of roadblocks from the Honduran political elite, the most recent of which was the decision of three appeals court judges to dismiss some of the charges against former first lady Bonilla de Lobo. According to El Heraldo, the Attorney General's Office has criticized the decision and plans to appeal it."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Knights Templar Claim To Have Negotiated Drop in Food Prices. Mexico's Knights Templar are allegedly behind a series of ""narco-banners"" claiming the group has helped lower food prices across the state of Michoacan, the latest in a series of ambitious public relations efforts by the criminal group. According to news service Agencia Esquema, one banner read , in part, ""The Knights Templar are not narcos, much less a criminal cartel, the Knights Templar are are a brotherhood of citizens who respect the constitution in the past few days our brotherhood has invited the meat and tortilla vendors to lower their prices. An invitation accepted by our friends the merchants and recognized by the neediest people of our state. Keeping clear that for said action to occur there existed no pressure, nor blackmail, much less charging fees."" "" Narcomantas"" were reported in the cities of Morelia, capital of Michoacan state, as well as Zitacuaro, Lazaro Cardenas, Uruapan, Apatzingan, Ocampo, and Tuxpan. This series of ""narcomantas"" follows the truce called by the Knights Templar in advance of the Pope's visit to Guanajuato, a state neighboring Michoacan. The group, an offshoot of the Familia Michoacana , has, like its predecessor, cultivated a unique image through its use of banners and religious iconography, like the Roman-style helmets seized in late February. This latest round of banners appears to be another cynical ploy to shore up public support. It seems unlikely that the Knights Templar were able to convince vendors to lower their prices without offering some kind of incentive, whether a threat or a bribe. Additionally, despite their claims otherwise, v iolence was not completely halted in their stronghold of Michoacan during the Pope's visit to neighboring Guanajuato, calling into question the sincerity of their public announcements.

"Top 3 Security Challenges Facing Honduras Next President. As leader of the world's most dangerous nation, Honduras' next president will face a unique set of security challenges. His response to these may determine whether the country begins to make a turnaround or moves closer to becoming a narco-state. Juan Orlando Hernandez, a member of the same conservative National Party as current President Porfirio Lobo, will step into office on January 27, 2014. He has been president of Congress since 2010, where he has promoted measures including the creation of a military police force and a 2012 law authorizing extraditions. But the new president faces a security situation that has steadily worsened since a 2009 military coup that toppled leftist ex-President Manuel Zelaya and plunged the country into economic and political turmoil. Since then, it has grown to become the most dangerous country in the world -- the homicide rate peaked in 2011 at 91.6 per 100,000 , according to the Organization of American States (OAS). Hernandez also faces a country with pervasive poverty -- in 2010, 66.2 percent of the population lived in poverty, the highest rate of any country in the Americas with available data listed by the OAS. While the new president is considered a highly influential politician -- one Honduran analyst told Reuters that his power ""exceeds that of President Porfirio Lobo himself"" -- it remains to be seen whether he can or will successfully implement policies that begin to pull the country from this hole. His response to the country's security problems may determine whether elements that have prompted debate over whether Honduras could become a failed state -- including weak and corrupt state institutions, increasingly powerful criminal groups and epidemic levels of violence -- will further consolidate during his presidency or begin to change. Below is a discussion of three major security challenges Hernandez will face, and how he may handle them. Transnational Criminal Organizations and Extradition In interviews with InSight Crime, both former security minister turned Hernandez campaign aide Oscar Alvarez and Honduran security analyst Eugenio Sosa identified the growing presence of transnational organized crime as one of the principal security challenges facing the country. Honduras has become a major transit point for northern bound cocaine flights -- up to 87 percent of US-bound flights from South America pass through the country, according to the US State Department. Simultaneously, it has seen a growth in the presence of transnational criminal organizations including Mexico's Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel, and the evolution of domestic criminal groups such as the Cachiros, a drug transport group that liaises between Colombian and Mexican organizations. As Julieta Castellanos, director of the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH), told InSight Crime, the expansion of this presence in Honduras has seen a troubling evolution in modes of violence. These have included an increase in massacres and the dismembering of victims' bodies, patterns similar to what has been seen from criminal organizations in Mexico. Hernandez has promised to be tough on criminals as president, stating, ""I'll do what I have to do to get rid of crime,"" reported EFE. According to Alvarez, Hernandez has plans to take on this growth in trafficking, particularly by identifying and forcing down drug planes flying through the country's airspace. The outgoing administration appears set to facilitate this -- Lobo recently announced the purchase of $30 million in radars to detect incoming planes, and the Congress approved a shoot-down law for suspected drug planes. Improving the infrastructure will not be enough to slow the growth of criminal organizations. Sosa told InSight Crime that the country needed to put more energy into intelligence operations, and said the military police body promoted by Hernandez would be better focused on specialized border operations than street crime. Hernandez was also instrumental in pushing for the controversial extradition law , which in theory allows the fate of Honduran criminals to be placed in the hands of the US justice system. No criminals have yet been extradited under the law, though the Supreme Court recently announced it was processing five extradition requests , without giving names. Hernandez is likely to continue promoting extradition as a legal tool to fight organized crime, Alvarez told InSight Crime. ""We are ready to put those guys on the first plane out,"" he said, referring implicitly to members of the Cachiros drug transport group. However, the appropriateness of using extradition to bring criminal organizations to justice is highly contentious. This is an important debate at present -- the US is expected to request the extradition of high-level members of the Cachiros, from whom $800 million in assets were seized last fall. The use of extradition to address deficits in Honduras' justice system has been criticized as an outsourcing of justice, and a case of the country bending to the will of the US. According to Sosa, high-level corruption present in the country could also block the effective use of this mechanism. What's more, extradition may lead to violence. Drug traffickers have threatened the incoming government, according to Alvarez, and high-profile killings of a presidential advisor and the country's top money laundering prosecutor have sparked fears that organized crime may mount an effort reminiscent of Pablo Escobar's bloody political campaign in the late 1980s to outlaw extradition in Colombia. Maras and 'Mano Dura' Another major security challenge is the country's street gangs; this is where much of Hernandez's security discourse has focused thus far. The Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) ""maras,"" as well as other criminal gangs, are major perpetrators of kidnapping and extortion, wreaking financial havoc on businesses and communities in Honduras, as well as in the country's ""Northern Triangle"" counterparts, Guatemala and El Salvador. The region's maras are more than localized threats -- the MS13 was designated a transnational criminal organization by the US State Department in 2012. Honduras' maras have also developed deep community ties in response to government anti-gang laws , and make membership appealing by providing social benefits to members that they might not otherwise receive. In a recent press conference, Hernandez remarked : ""For the mara members, those who commit extortion, the dark party that has caused so much harm in this country has ended."" He added that those who choose not to voluntarily give up this lifestyle ""have the alternative of leaving the country, or if not, ending up in jail."" However, the kind of ""mano dura"" (iron fist) strategy Hernandez proposes has proven to have a perverse effect on violence throughout Latin America, filling the region's jails with easy gang recruits. It has also raised human rights concerns over the violation of civil liberties and the profiling of youth. Despite the characterization of his strategy as iron fist by analysts, Alvarez says Hernandez's proposals go beyond simply being tough on crime. According to the ex-security minister, he is planning a three-pronged approach that additionally involves economic and social measures. These include prevention programs to keep youths from gang involvement and an anti-poverty initiative titled ""Vida Mejor"" (Better Life). Political rhetoric, though, is cheap. And in order to make a dent into the gang problem, he will have to commit real resources to a long-term strategy that aims to improve infrastructure, economic opportunity and social programs in the same way that it tackles crime. Facing a fiscal crisis, Hernandez may find it impossible to find these resources. Institutional Reform and Purging Police A third, related challenge -- and arguably the central one facing Honduras -- is that of severely weak and corrupt institutions. As Sosa put it, ""If we don't have a functional state, there is no way to confront [the other] problems."" Castellanos, similarly, identified state weakness as a factor that has allowed cartels and domestic groups to become stronger in the country, setting up in areas where they are unlikely to be touched. Organized crime has also deeply penetrated state institutions, in Honduras and throughout the region, she said. The dysfunctional institutions include the judicial and penal systems. Impunity is rampant in the country , and various judges have recently come under investigation for impeding justice and issuing sentences that favor criminals. The Cachiros, meanwhile, are believed to have operated with the blessing of the country's economic and political elites. But the most urgent reforms are needed in the police force. Up to 40 percent of members have organized crime ties , according to one official, and the force has frequently been a direct actor in the country's violence. As Lisa Haugaard, executive director of the Latin America Working Group (LAWG), told InSight Crime, a key question is whether Hernandez will show the necessary political will in going after corrupt elements of the police. The country's two-year-old police reform process had led to just seven confirmed dismissals as of mid-January , though numerous officers have failed confidence tests. Alvarez said Hernandez would likely expedite the process, stating: ""He said that whatever makes the process more efficient, he is willing to try."" Sosa, meanwhile, said he doubted a systematic and comprehensive cleansing and reorganization of the force would occur. A major tenet of the president's strategy for filling this hole in the security forces is the continued use and expansion of the Military Police of Public Order (PMOP), which was approved and began operating during his time as head of Congress. The unit is composed of soldiers that will be deployed to the streets to combat crime, and is set to grow to 5,000 members. Hernandez recently called on the Congress to give the military police constitutional status and increase their range of responsibilities, reported El Heraldo. He has also expressed plans to keep the force in operation until the national police force has been completely purged of corrupt officers under the ongoing reform process, reported EFE. According to Sosa, the militarization of security, for instance to combat gangs, may bring positive results in terms of the perception of citizens that the government is facing down the problem. It may even have a short-term positive effect, he said, but the strategy is unlikely to be sustainable over the long term, in part because of the government's extremely limited resources. Castellanos called the blending of police and military roles a problematic and ""risky"" strategy, not just in Honduras but throughout the region, and said it was not an appropriate substitute for comprehensive police reform. In addition, as noted by Haugaard, the strategy of placing the military on the streets as reinforcement for an ineffective police force fails to get at the root of the problem -- the corrupt links at the top. The strategy -- which is set to involve close collaboration between the PMOP and the police -- also runs the implicit risk of ""contamination"" of the military by corrupt police elements, said Sosa. The security challenges are numerous and immense, and Hernandez's policy proposals thus far are incomplete and controversial. Hernandez is also off to a rocky start before his term even begins -- his win left a bitter taste in the mouths of Libre and Anti-Corruption Party supporters, who called it election fraud. He will first have to pull together a divided Congress if his administration is to accomplish its aims democratically, while simultaneously dealing with a crippling fiscal deficit."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Fuel Trafficking Costs Honduras $230 Mn per Year. Honduras is losing $230 million per year in revenues because of fuel smuggling, a practice driven by criminal groups capitalizing on Venezuela's fuel subsidies. According to Honduran Minister of Industry and Trade Adonis Lavaire, illegally imported fuel costs the country the equivalent of ten percent of its annual fuel imports, which he said stand at $2.3 billion, reported El Heraldo. On September 26, the Honduran navy reported capturing a boat carrying 40,000 gallons of illegal fuel headed for the Caribbean coastal town of Puerto Castilla, having apparently departed from the island of Curacao. The haul takes Honduras' total illegal fuel recoveries to 190,000 gallons in less than a week, after a ship originating in Venezuela was captured off the country's Caribbean island of Roatan carrying 150,000 gallons. According to Proceso , the fuel originates in Venezuela, where it is produced and where government subsidies make it lucrative for criminal bands to smuggle the product to other countries. As reported by Proceso, Honduras has been particularly vulnerable to fuel smuggling since the 2009 ousting of former President Manuel Zelaya, which saw the country suspended from Petrocaribe -- an alliance between Venezuela and various Caribbean nations which provides members with subsidized Venezuelan fuel. Large hauls of illegal fuel have already been recovered this year and while in August it was reported that Honduras would begin receiving subsidized fuel again in September, as Proceso reports, so far none has arrived. This leaves Honduras open to organized criminal groups importing cheap fuel, with Proceso reporting that they also tamper with the product so that vehicles and machinery end up damaged. Mexico is also an important point of origin for illegal fuel destined for Honduras and Mexican cartels are known to be involved in the activity. Venezuela has a particular problem with fuel theft, something which it pledged to combat this year , however with contraband fuel pouring over the border into Colombia, as well as out to sea, and with corruption deeply ingrained in Venezuelan security forces, how it will effectively address the situation remains unclear.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
In Rare Move, Bolivia and Chile Cooperate in Drug Ring Bust. In the one of the first acts of cooperation since Chile and Bolivia had a spat over the arrest of Bolivia's former top drug czar, the two countries collaborated in an operation targeting a money laundering and drug trafficking ring. With support from Chilean police, Bolivia's Special Force Against Drug Trafficking (Fuerza Especial de Lucha Contra el Narcotrafico - FELCN) carried out twelve simultaneous raids across the country in efforts to dismantle the criminal group, which is active in both countries, reports La Razon. Five people were arrested on drug trafficking and money laundering charges, while police seized at least thirteen properties, 40 vehicles and more than $70,000 in cash in the cities of Cochabamba, Santa Cruz and La Paz. Los Tiempos reports that the crackdown was intended to impact the Vilque Soria family, believed to run drug trafficking networks in Bolivia and Chile, laundering the proceeds through various front companies. The FELCN commander in Santa Cruz, Fernando Amurrio, confirmed that the investigation was prompted by the seizure of over 800 kilos of cocaine in Chile in July 2010. Police traced the shipment back to Betzabe Vilque Soria, owner of the international shipping company Udebol. Vilque Soria is believed to be one of the main ringleaders of the gang. This is one of the first signs of collaboration between Chilean and Bolivian security forces, ever since the arrest of Bolivia's former top anti-drug official raised tensions between the two countries. The international warrant for the arrest of retired police general Rene Sanabria was issued thanks to Chilean intelligence, who did not inform the top levels of the Bolivian government first. President Evo Morales later criticized the move. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"The Role of Women in Guatemalan Extortion Gangs. A report from Prensa Libre highlights the key role that women play in extortion gangs in Guatemala , carrying out recruitment and gathering intelligence on victims, with the advantage that they are less likely to attract the attention of the police. According to the newspaper , of the 532 people arrested so far this year by the Special Anti-Extortion Task Force, 150 were women. Women rarely hold leadership positions in the groups, Prensa Libre reported, but they do take an active role, recruiting members and gathering intelligence on extortion targets. Women draw less attention than men, making it easier to carry out these operations, Guatemalan Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla told the paper. Lopez added that women are often drawn into the extortion gangs because of family or romantic ties with male members. Such was the case in the recent arrest of seven Guatemalans who had been extorting nearly $320 per week from various bus companies over a three-year period. Four of those arrested were female family members, including the 51-year-old mother and 23-year-old sister of an Barrio 18 gang member who directed the extortion operation from prison. Women often work as underlings in Latin America's drug trafficking organizations, as with the extortionists in Guatemala, but there are several cases where women have gained powerful positions within drug cartels. One of the most famous is Colombian Griselda Blanco , who was one of the biggest traffickers of cocaine into the US during the 1970s and 80s, and an alleged mentor to Pablo Escobar. Mexico 's National Women's Institute and military have both stated in recent years that women are taking on more important roles in organized crime in the country. According to recent reports, a woman may be in line to become head of Mexico's Gulf Cartel following the arrest of its leader Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez, alias "" El Coss ,"" in September. The authorities dismantled a Zetas training camp in June last year and found that half of the trainees were females."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Report Highlights Mexicos Chaotic Prison System. A new report from Mexico's National Commission on Human Rights documents the deplorable conditions in the nation's prisons, highlighting a fundamental obstacle to improvements in security. The National Commission on Human Rights (CNDH) recently published its annual examination of Mexico's prisons and jails, and the 585-page report offers a detailed radiography of the system's many ills. The CNDH measured the state and national prison facilities according to five categories: how well a facility protects the physical and moral condition of an inmate; whether it guarantees a dignified stay; the facility's governability; its success in preparing inmates for societal readaptation; and whether it protects at-risk groups, like HIV-positive inmates. The state prisons secured an average rating of 6.02 out of ten, their lowest rating in the past four years. There was a great deal of variation in the scores, from a high of 7.59 in Guanajuato to a low of 3.66 in Quintana Roo. There was little correlation between a state's ties to organized crime and the condition of its prisons. Violence riddled northern states like Sinaloa, Guerrero, Tamaulipas, and Nuevo Leon were all among the eight lowest scorers, but equally chaotic states like Chihuahua and Baja California both scored well above the national average. Similarly, some of the most peaceful states were among the worst performers. The federal prisons, known in Mexico as ""ceferesos,"" generally scored higher and saw lower variation from one center to the next. The average score was a 6.83 out of ten, ranging from a score of 5.59 in a Ciudad Juarez prison to an 8.18 for a federal prison in Morelos. While their scores were more constant, the federal prisons showed an enormous amount of variation in the populations housed within. Some of the most notorious prisons were drastically overpopulated, a long-term problem in Mexico. One prison in Sonora was designed for 2,520 inmates, but was housing nearly 3,500 the day of CNDH's visit. The Juarez prison that stands at the bottom of the CNDH's rankings was built for 848 inmates, but was home to 1,150. The Altiplano prison, from which Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman escaped earlier this year , has 1,140 people living in a space designed for 836. As Alejandro Hope has written , any prison that is so dramatically above its residency capacity has no hope of actually providing maximum security against escapes, massacres, or criminal activity within the prison, notwithstanding the label. At the same time, many other federal prisons are nowhere near capacity. Mexico's chaotic prison system remains one of the foremost obstacles to a safer nation. The most glaring example of the system's defects is Guzman's escape, but such cases are legion. In 2010, 191 prisoners slipped away from jails in Tamaulipas in two separate incidents. Thirty inmates escaped from a prison in Nuevo Leon during a 2012 riot, in which 44 prisoners lost their lives. In perhaps the most notorious recent incident prior to Guzman's escape, more than 50 alleged members of the Zetas were filmed walking out of the front door of a Zacatecas prison in 2009. Escapes are hardly the only manifestation of the jails' breakdown. Mass killings inside the prison have been regular occurrences in recent years. In addition to the Nuevo Leon riot, since 2009 dozens of prisoners at a time have died in riots in Gomez Palacio on two occasions ; in Juarez on two occasions; in Durango ; in Mazatlan ; and in Tamaulipas. No system that has hosted so many bloodbaths in such a short time period can be fulfilling its goals. Inmates often control the prisons to the degree that they can continue carrying out criminal activities from behind bars. Many virtual kidnapping rings -- which falsely attempt to convince their targets that a loved one has been kidnapped so as to secure a ransom payment to be deposited into a bank account -- operate from behind bars. There are also several examples of top drug kingpins retaining control over their empires despite living behind bars, which has been one of the justifications for increased extraditions to the United States in recent years. Unfortunately, there has been little sustained effort to improve Mexico's prisons. Former President Felipe Calderon pushed to construct new prison facilities, but it does not appear that his efforts actually led to a substantial increase in capacity nationwide. It also seems that prison reform lacks any dedicated support within the Pena Nieto administration. Unfortunately, as the CNDH report makes clear, there is lots of work left to be done."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Argentina Case Highlights Growing Sophistication of Domestic Gangs. The prosecution of 35 members of the Rosario-based Los Monos drug gang has provided an inside look at a sophisticated operation that has infiltrated state structures and appears to be involved in drug production, in one example of Argentina's evolving organized crime landscape. The case is a result of investigations that began in September 2012 following the murder of Martin Paz, alias ""Fantasma,"" a member of Los Monos who fellow members accused of using the gang's money to start his own drug business in Rosario, reported L a Nacion. Paz bought 80 kilos of coca paste in Bolivia to process in Rosario, but the drugs were seized en route by Argentine authorities. Among those being prosecuted are the son of a leader of the group, Ariel Maximo Cantero, and the representative of Buenos Aires soccer player Angel Correa, whose links with the gang came under investigation last year. Eleven members of the Santa Fe provincial police, a federal police agent and a member of the navy are also accused of ties to the group, reported Clarin. Los Monos is run by the Cantero clan. The two main leaders, Ariel Cantero and Ramon Machuca, have been on the run for nearly a year. The group's structure includes a network of hired assassins and money launderers, and the gang operates with the protection of corrupt police. In addition to micro-trafficking, the gang is involved in extortion, money laundering and the sale of private security services, according to Clarin. The gang members are currently being processed for illicit association, but the case is set to be brought to federal courts so they can be tried for drug-related crimes. Los Monos' ability to draw in corrupt police, involvement in drug production and multi-layered structure are all signs of a sophisticated operation, and are representative of a general evolution taking place in Argentina's drug trade. Once a cocaine transit nation and major consumer market, Argentina has now become a center of production for Mexican cartels, and the country's street level drug trade has also evolved. Rosario is the city that has most strongly felt this change. Lying at the end of the Ruta 34 highway -- a major transit route for moving cocaine from Bolivia to Argentine cities -- it has become a hub both for drug trafficking and production, with the country's biggest cocaine factory yet discovered nearby last year. Fighting between Los Monos and other drug gangs for control over the local drug market, has caused Rosario's homicide rate to soar. Last year saw a record number of homicides in Rosario , with 264 registered killings -- 76 percent more than in 2012. As the gangs have grown, they have also begun to use methods typical of larger groups, including the intimidation of political figures and the employment of ""sicario"" (hitman) networks ."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Gangs Spread Tentacles Across World. Mexico's drug gangs are increasingly developing ties to mafias around the world, from Japan to India, Russia, and Western Europe. Mexico's drug gangs have exploded into a frenzy of violence in recent years. Less visible, but just as significant, is their increased power in the international drug market, and connections to foreign criminal organizations. As Contralinea reports, while Mexican groups like the Sinaloa Cartel have long had close links with Colombian cocaine suppliers and U.S. drug wholesalers, they are now establishing their presence across the world. In the process, they are carving out links with some of the most established groups in southeast Asia, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent. While reports of Mexican groups being mixed up in drug rings in places as far afield as Malaysia and West Africa is nothing new, recent evidence points to a more substantial, enduring presence in strategically important foreign nations. Not only are they buying and selling large shipments of cocaine, they are setting up shop in local retail markets and carving out toeholds in newly important regions like West Africa and India. The ""Mexicanization"" of the international drug trade has an impact on Mexico. For the governmental agencies charged with combating these gangs it is bad news. Increased profits and new sanctuaries abroad can reduce the gangs' vulnerability to local prosecutions, while also increasing their financial capacity to corrupt. Indeed, one source contacted by Contralinea speculated that the expansion of Mexican drug gangs is being orchestrated by legitimate government office-holders, though he offered zero evidence to support such a charge. Contralinea's map of Mexican drug gang connections abroad The following is InSight's translation of extracts from the report. Their bilateral investigations [by Italian and American authorities] have revealed that the Gulf Cartel maintains links with the 'Ndrangheta, the criminal organization that controls the region of Calabria and, in the international scene, traffics drugs to New York and Europe. The binational operation Reckoning was the first antecedent for American and Italian authorities regarding the drug-trafficking links between [Italy] and Mexico. The operation showed that the Mexican traffickers exported cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana in large quantities to Italy. With information from Japanese authorities, the report [from the State Department] indicates that ""methamphetamine is illegally smuggled in principally from Iran, Mexico, and Africa. The exporters of marijuana are Canada and the United States, while the domestic cultivation of marijuana is rising, though it is of small scale."" The report adds that more than 80 percent of the arrests for drug trafficking are related to methamphetamine, a market that continues to be the greatest threat for the anti-drug efforts of the Japanese government. Researcher Daniel Marquez points out that international drug trafficking ""is a business of $400 billion annually."" With the phenomenon of the globalization of crime, he offers two hypotheses linked to the role of the intelligence agencies in the traffic of drugs and the role that illicit substances play in corrupting officials: ""If all that money is moved, someone necessarily must control it and maybe they aren't the big cartels or those big criminal groups -- the Zetas, the Beltran Leyvas, the Familia Michoacana, the Valencia Valencias, the Gulf -- but maybe there is a higher level of decision making."" American authorities point to Peru as the second largest producer of cocaine in the world and a big importer of precursor chemicals used for the production of that drug. It is estimated that, across the country, some 40,000 hectares are dedicated to the cultivation of coca. At the same time, they identify Mexican traffickers as some of their principal clients. According to American investigations, the links detected thus far involve the Peruvian mafia and the Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas. Furthermore, the Council of the European Union says that the erstwhile hegemony of the Colombian cartels in the drug business in Colombia is presently shared with the Tijuana, Sinaloa, Juarez, and Guadalajara Cartels. Along with the Russian mafia and the Chinese triads, the Mexicans are one of the three principal mafias of transnational organized crime, PRI Deputy Maria de Jesus Aguirre Maldonado said on March 6, while presenting a bill to consider organized crime a threat to national security. According to Europol, the presence of Mexican cartels in European markets is growing. ""The growth of the cocaine traffic from Mexico to Spain and Portugal is striking. This could indicate a new trend in the importance that the European Union, along with the predominance of the Mexican cartels in the illegal drug markets in the United States and the levels of violence linked to their activities. In the assessment mid-term review and regional indicative programme 2011-2013 for Latin America, the European Union warns that the Mexican cartels have begun to replace the Colombians in drug trafficking, principally in the world cocaine market, ""seemingly as a result of successful actions against the Colombian mafia."" According to Annex 6 of the report, ""Central America and the Caribbean are two of the principal regions for cocaine transit. In 2008 alone they represented 15 percent of all world seizures."" It adds that in Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, cocaine production has increased. ""This reflects the growing importance of these countries in traffic of that drug, to satisfy internal demand and to export drugs to Europe (principally through West Africa), Africa, and the Pacific region.""

"Honduras Minor Latest to Inherit Drug Empire in Latin America?A judge has unexpectedly released the son of a leader of Honduras' Valle Valle drug clan, who allegedly took the reins of the family business following the capture and extradition of the group's leaders. A juvenile court in the western department of Copan has released the underage son of drug kingpin Luis Alonso Valle Valle following his arrest on suspicion of murder, El Heraldo reported. Valle Valle's defendant stated that ""there was a lack of evidence that the youth participated in the assassination of three people."" Unidentified sources told news outlet El Heraldo that the minor is currently the Valle Valle clan's second-in-command and runs drug trafficking operations in various locations around the country. The Valle Valle's top leaders -- brothers Luis Alonso and Miguel Arnulfo -- were arrested and extradited to the United States on drug trafficking charges in 2014. The Public Ministry (Ministerio Publico - MP) announced that it will appeal the judge's call for the temporary suspension of proceedings. ""We are surprised by the judge's decision,"" the MP statement reads. ""For the first time in a case of its kind, [the judicial official] did not admit as evidence the telephone recordings, which demonstrate [the suspect's] participation in the crime."" Members of the military police and Technical Criminal Investigation Agency (Agencia Tecnica de Investigacion Criminal - ATIC) detained the minor, whose identity cannot be revealed for legal reasons, on September 9 after an arrest warrant was issued against him. Two other people were captured in the operation in the western department of Comayagua, and firearms were seized from the suspect's vehicle. Although still unverified, reports that Luis Alonso's son has taken the reins of his father's criminal group are certainly plausible. The Valle Valle's cocaine trafficking activities were largely a family-run operation, and the youth could be the clan's natural successor. Nor would he be the first son of a powerful crime boss to follow in his father's footsteps. The sons of Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, Jesus Alfredo Guzman and Ivan Archivaldo Guzman, have both been blacklisted by the US Treasury ""for their criminal activities on behalf of their father, Chapo Guzman, and the Sinaloa Cartel."" Jesus Alfredo has been described as one of his father's right-hand men. Ivan Archivaldo was arrested in Mexico for money laundering in 2005, and later released. Both were in the headlines recently after they were allegedly kidnapped by a rival cartel. El Chapo's main partner in the Sinaloa Cartel, Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias ""El Mayo,"" has reportedly been preparing his sons to take over his business for years. A number of El Mayo's children have already been arrested , and at least one has been extradited to the United States for trafficking multiple tons of cocaine into the country. Following the demobilization of the paramilitary umbrella group United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC) in the 2000s, it emerged that sons and other relatives of extradited paramilitary chiefs were taking over a new generation of drug trafficking organizations known as ""bandas criminales,"" or BACRIM. In 2009, for example, authorities arrested Hernan Giraldo Ochoa, alias ""Rambo"" -- the son of paramilitary boss Hernan Giraldo Serna -- for being the second-in-command of "" Los Nevados ,"" a trafficking group born out of his father's demobilized paramilitary bloc in northern Colombia. Several sons and daughters of the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, who ran the now-defunct Cali Cartel, have also been accused of laundering drug trafficking profits for their fathers. And Guatemalan kingpin Walther Overdick 's son Kevin Paul Overdick Barrios was arrested in July 2011 at a ""narco-party"" on suspicion of being a member of the Zetas criminal organization."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Is Organized Crime Behind Uruguays Homicide Uptick?After a spate of homicides in Uruguay, there is growing concern that violence is connected to organized crime groups, an assessment that could be premature and lead to an ineffective policy response. Authorities in Uruguay recorded 218 homicides during the first half of 2018, representing a 66 percent increase from the 131 homicides that were recorded during the same period last year. Officials said 40 percent of these homicides were related to fighting among criminal groups. ""We are convinced that the increase in violence in Uruguay is not the product of the strengthening of criminal gangs but of confrontation between them,"" Interior Minister Eduardo Bonomi said in comments to El Observador in April. Authorities are reportedly investigating 20 criminal groups with international connections for allegedly supplying drugs to be resold in Uruguay. International drug trafficking groups have also long used the capital city of Montevideo and its port -- one of South America's major commercial ports -- as transshipment points for drug loads en route to markets in Europe and Asia, while also taking advantage of the country's porous borders with Argentina and Brazil. In the past, authorities have raised concerns that this dynamic could potentially lead to an increase in the domestic consumption of drugs and related violence stemming from disputes over control of the local and international criminal markets. Authorities in Uruguay have been quick to link the recent uptick in homicides to criminal groups operating in the country without offering much corroborating evidence. And while the increase is significant, there are probably a variety of factors contributing to it. As we know from other parts of the region, authorities regularly use organized crime as a scapegoat when there are upticks in violence, but the detailed and time-consuming analysis needed to make such a connection is often absent. ""The increase in Uruguay's homicide rate is far too complex to narrow down to one single cause,"" Geoff Ramsey, a research and communications associate at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) think tank, told InSight Crime. Ramsey said he would be ""skeptical"" of those linking Uruguay's homicide rate solely with organized crime groups because while there are criminal networks in the country, Ramsey says they are mostly ""small, unsophisticated street gangs that operate in the periphery of major cities."" This rush to judge can at times go hand-in-hand with the implementation of security policies aimed at beefing up security force budgets in the short-term, at the expense of long-term social and economic projects. Indeed, authorities are reportedly preparing to expand Uruguay's security budget in response to the recent violence, which could lead to the use of more heavy-handed strategies that have proven ineffective elsewhere throughout the region. Recently approved legislation will also expand the military's ability to carry out surveillance and other security tasks in the country's border regions, likely in an effort to prevent criminal groups from using the country's porous borders to move drug shipments but also as a means to increase the military's role in the war against crime, which is more often the purview of civilian authorities. This comes as authorities in Uruguay are facing rising public pressure to militarize the fight against organized crime groups, which in part prompted Uruguay President Tabare Vazquez to announce plans to increase coordination among security institutions. The legalization of marijuana in Uruguay in 2013, followed by the start of legal sales in 2017, raised concerns about the black market and increased drug consumption and how this might affect violence between criminal groups vying to control this market. However, Ramsey, who recently co-authored a report examining marijuana legalization in Uruguay, told InSight Crime that the percentage of Uruguayans who say they've used marijuana in the last year has increased by just one percent, making it unlikely that marijuana legalization has had an impact on levels of violence. ""This is especially true now that so much of the cannabis market is being regulated, and thus taken out of the hands of criminal networks,"" Ramsey said. Even with the recorded increase in homicides so far this year, Uruguay is still one of Latin America's safest countries and often the country of choice for criminals searching for a safe haven rather than a battleground."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Police Convict Chile Drug Trafficker After Discovering Secret Code. Authorities in Chile have used a secret code belonging to drug dealers to convict a suspect, in a case showing that, while criminal methods are constantly evolving, the most basic techniques can still throw authorities off the trail. In 2010, Chile's national police, the Carabineros, arrested Leonardo Yanez Sepulveda with 80 grams of cocaine in Santiago. In his wallet, they found notes that detailed a coded language used by the traffickers to communicate via text messages, reported La Tercera. The notes contained a full explanation of how to use the coded alphabet, and how to decipher incoming coded messages (click on La Tercera's image below to see full-sized original). The notes state: ""The idea is to avoid using spaces, so it will be impossible for the investigative police (PDI) to decipher. They won't know that we are communicating, and it will be impossible to understand, unless they get this piece of paper, which you can't just have anywhere; you have to hide it."" Prosecutor Macarena Canas said that for the authorities who analyzed the note, the find was completely novel. ""It's like the Rosetta Stone; you have a complete dictionary,"" he said. Four years later, on February 4, 2014, this same code was used to convict Yanez for drug trafficking and sentence him to three years in prison. There are plenty of examples of the ever-changing modalities used by drug traffickers to avoid detection. Trafficking methods can include converting cocaine to liquid form , hiding it in consumable products such as pastries , and having ""mules"" swallow liquid capsules. Major drug trafficking organizations often use coded language over radios tuned to special frequencies to communicate and track security force movement, and the equipment can be quite sophisticated. This case in Chile, which evokes thoughts of an old mystery novel, takes things back to basics, illustrating that the simplest strategies can also still be used effectively at the local level. (While the case is not explained in detail, the fact Yanez was carrying only 80 grams of cocaine and received a relatively short sentence suggests he was little more than a street dealer.) It is also noteworthy that Chilean authorities managed to use this code, once they deciphered it, to achieve a conviction. The majority of criminal trials in Latin America continue to be dependent on witness testimony , which can be unreliable or hampered by fear and intimidation, disrupting justice in major cases."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Attorney General: Two-Thirds of Homicides Gang-Related. Gang-perpetrated violence accounts for two-thirds of homicides in El Salvador, according to numbers from the Attorney General's Office, but the government data is confusing and does not tell the whole story. El Salvador's Attorney General's Office has announced the results of a year-end analysis on crime, stating that 65 percent of homicides in 2015 were committed by gang members, reported La Prensa Grafica. The data from the Attorney General's Office also pointed to the enormous growth of violence and criminal activity over the past year. In comparison to 2014, this year saw a 74 percent rise in homicides. El Salvador has now surpassed Honduras in terms of violence, stated El Diario de Hoy , with a rate of 90 homicides for every 100,000 citizens. The report also highlighted the rise in ""multiple homicides,"" cases in which there are two or more victims. Since last year, the number of multiple homicides rose almost 200 percent, up to 450 cases in 2015. The attorney general's emphasis on the gang-related violence is not surprising. The government has taken a hard-line against gangs, and put them front and center in its fight against crime. However, the data eminating from the government is also a little unclear. In November, a police study suggested that nearly 70 percent of murder victims in El Salvador had no gang connections. This subverted the government's traditional narrative that most of the country's violence is related to conflicts between gangs, and does not affect civilians for the most part. What's more, police and other suspected vigilante groups are have been connected to massacres of suspected gang members and civilians. And many analysts have noted an uptick in that type of violence as well. Nevertheless, the numbers from both the police and the attorney general suggests that gang violence is having an increasingly wide impact. Alongside civilian casualties, gang violence has increasingly targeted police, military and public security forces, as the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) street gang seeks to gain further control of drug trafficking operations, according to a recent Center for Strategic & International Studies report. Gang violence against security forces has also increased, as the MS13 and rival gang the Barrio 18 have allegedly ramped up efforts to pressure the government to restore the 2012 truce and reduce anti-gang initiatives. All of these factors put together have contributed to levels of violence not seen since El Salvador's civil war in the 1980s."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"El Montanero Capture Shows Power of El Mesa Crime Group in Colombia. Authorities in Colombia have captured a crime boss who began as a gang leader on Medellin's outskirts and came to control a massive criminal enterprise in the region. Luis Rodrigo Rodriguez, alias ""El Montanero,"" the head of the El Mesa crime organization, was captured by police on October 26 at a rural estate in the municipality of Aranzazu, in the Caldas department in northwest Colombia. The Public Prosecutor's Office against Organized Crime had issued a warrant for Rodriguez's arrest by on charges of conspiracy, extortion and drug trafficking. He is also accused of murder and forced displacement. President Ivan Duque announced the capture via his Twitter account, stating that Rodriguez's arrest represents a blow to the criminal group. Yet this is not the first time Colombian authorities have arrested Rodriguez. According to the newspaper El Colombiano , he was imprisoned on three separate occasions: first in 1998 on charges of attempted murder, and then again in 2001 after having escaped prison a year earlier. He was released shortly after his rearrest. Rodriguez was then arrested in 2003, when he and some 20 gang members took part in the armed robbery of a truck in Bogota, which ended in a gun battle with authorities that left two dead, including a police officer. He was sentenced to nearly 27 years in prison but freed ten years later in 2013. He also managed to acquire three legal identities, with the help of corrupt notaries in the National Registry. This kept him off a wanted poster in April after authorities said that he could not be properly identified. The capture of El Montanero shows the trajectory and reach of El Mesa, which has long been considered a lower-level street gang but has emerged quietly as a major player in Colombian organized crime. El Mesa formed more than three decades ago in Bello, a municipality just north of Medellin. It originally operated in the neighborhood of Mesa. It strengthened under its links to the Oficina de Envigado , a confederation of smaller mafias that has controlled Medellin's underworld since the 1990s. During the last decade, the group has gained a foothold in Bogota. It can count on some 300 members and is involved in street-level drug sales, murder-for-hire operations, and extortion rackets. It also extended into areas in north and northeast Antioquia by forming alliances alliances with other groups operating in the region, including La Oficina, El Tapon, Los Chatas, Niquia Camacol, guerrillas from the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarios de Colombia - FARC) dissident cells. The group was able to spread and to gain power, in part, because authorities never conducted a targeted operation against the El Mesa, viewing it as a gang with little reach. But the group is, in fact, a structured criminal organization, ""with a boss and (other) leaders that run each of its zones,"" organized crime prosecutor Claudia Carrasquilla told El Colombiano in 2018. SEE ALSO : Colombia Town Outside Medellin Sees Murders Rise, Then Drop As a boss, Rodriguez has a long history in the underworld and is ""well respected among the criminals of Bello,"" another prosecutor said. Meanwhile, gang violence erupted in Bello this year after a street war broke out among three major gangs: La Mesa, Los Pachelly and Niquia Camacol. During the first six months of 2019, the municipality tallied more than 100 murders, up from 38 in the previous year. It is now believed that the groups have agreed to a truce to reduce violence. The capture of El Montanero, however, could lead to internal conflicts in El Mesa, breaking the tense calm within Bello. It wouldn't be the first time the group has fractured. A faction that allied itself with ex-members of Los Pachelly took on the larger EL Mesa gang in 2016, unleashing a wave of violence."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"New Report Offers Details on Cocaine Traffic to Europe. A new report provides insight into how traffickers move cocaine to the lucrative European market, including the key trafficking routes and smuggling techniques criminal groups have adopted to skirt drug interdiction efforts. The recently released 2016 EU Drug Trafficking Report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and Europol explains Latin America's role in the European cocaine industry, and the different routes and methods used to traffic the drug across the Atlantic (see map below). Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela are singled out as ""key departure points"" for Europe-bound cocaine, from where the drug is smuggled out in vessels, private yachts or by air, among other methods. According to the report, the increasing importance of Brazil suggests that Bolivia and Peru are expanding their role as suppliers for the European market. The traffic of Colombian cocaine into Venezuela across a ""porous border"" has similarly increased. From Venezuela, criminal groups use both flights and maritime routes -- capitalizing on the busy traffic off the Venezuelan coast -- to send the drugs to Europe. Despite data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) suggesting otherwise, the report adds, Colombia is likely to continue being a key shipment point for cocaine heading to Europe, as evidenced by its growing production figures and continuing seizures. Ecuador and Argentina are also mentioned as departure points for the drug. The Caribbean and West Africa are reportedly the two most common transit zones for cocaine moving across the Atlantic, and Central America appears to be becoming an increasingly important stop-off point. The Caribbean Sea's main trafficking hubs are the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, although there have been reports that some activity has shifted to Caribbean countries further east. Central America and the Caribbean was the only area to see a rise in cocaine seizures in 2013, with confiscations nearly doubling to 162 metric tons from 78 metric tons a year earlier, according to the EMCDDA. Behind the increase was a 800 percent spike in Dominican Republic seizures, which reached 86 metric tons in 2015. The apparent escalation of illegal trafficking through the Caribbean is described as a possible result of recent crackdowns in Mexico and Central America. West Africa's Bight of Benin -- between Ghana and Nigeria -- as well as the islands of Cape Verde, Madeira and the Canary Islands, make up the second major transit zone for cocaine heading to Europe. Nevertheless, the report points out that the Bight of Benin may be have lost importance in recent years. Once on the other side of the Atlantic, cocaine continues its journey by sea, land or air, principally to western or southern Europe. In 2014, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Italy reportedly accounted for 80 percent of the 61.6 metic tons of cocaine seized in the European Union. The largest ports on the continent -- Rotterdam in Holland, and Antwerp, Belgium -- are thought to be key entry points for cocaine. Dutch police estimated that 25 to 50 percent of all cocaine filtered into Europe through Rotterdam, following the seizure of 10 metric tons of the drug at the port in 2013. Of the 11 million containers that pass through the Rotterdam annually, only 50,000 are scanned (0.45 percent). Other key entry ports are Algeciras and Valencia in Spain, and Hamburg in Germany. The EMCDDA expressed increasing concern over the use of existing trafficking routes for other drugs to move cocaine, including cannabis corridors in Morocco and Algeria and heroin corridors in Tanzania. The report warns that Tanzania may emerge as a new cocaine route to Europe, given an increase in seizures in East Africa and as a consequence of the Panama Canal's expansion. The vast capacity for moving drugs and diversity of routes offered by maritime transport makes it the preferred option for cocaine traffickers to Europe. Traffickers are increasingly hiding cocaine in shipping containers aboard commercial vessels, which makes it harder to detect. Seizures involving containers have reportedly gone up sixfold since 2006. Colombian and Italian organized crime networks reportedly continue to dominate the cocaine trade in Europe, in cooperation with Dutch, British, Spanish and Nigerian groups. The Netherlands and Spain are primary distribution centers. One of the most interesting trends highlighted by the report is that traffickers prefer to transit through the Caribbean rather than Central America on their way to Europe. While this may appear to be the easiest route, in the past organizations were known to send drugs to Central American countries before crossing the Atlantic. The theory that the Caribbean is re-emerging as a popular drug route as Central American traffic declines has been suggested since at least 2010 , and evidence over the years has both supported and refuted this theory. There is a general consensus that tougher interdiction in Central America and Mexico is behind the supposed revival of the Caribbean corridor that had been popular in the 1980s, although such predictions have mainly be applied to drug trafficking to the United States. Still, it appears that the Caribbean route is more significant for Europe-bound cargo, as Central America remains the main trafficking corridor for northbound narcotics. Another revealing takeaway from the report is the evolution of trafficking techniques used by criminals to skirt interdiction efforts. The growing use of shipping containers to move cocaine demonstrates how criminal organizations are taking advantage of increasing global maritime traffic to run their business. Part of this trend is the increasingly popular ""rip-on/rip-off"" technique, which relies on the use of corrupt port officials to slip drugs into legitimate containers by breaking and replacing the security seal at the point of origin. Concealing cocaine with perishable goods also ensures the drugs pass through controls faster. It is unsurprising that traffickers should take advantage of shipping routes -- maritime trade handles tremendous volume and is a sector often overlooked in the fight against organized crime, providing the perfect cover for drug smugglers. In addition, corruption, informality and a lack of resources in many departure ports makes it easier for groups to smuggle their drugs onto ships. Such is the case in Peru, where Mexican traffickers reportedly control Pacific drug routes to Europe. The report illustrates how criminal groups must be consistently creative to survive, noting new smuggling techniques used by drug mules that include ingesting liquid rather than powder cocaine, and concealing drugs in breast implants. Europe's relevance to the global cocaine trade is not to be underestimated. High profit margins for traffickers and a saturated US market are likely to increase its importance in the coming years."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Is Slain Drug Boss El Chayo Still Alive?Testimony from a captured leader of a Mexican drug gang contradicts the official story of the death of Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, alias 'El Chayo,' fueling rumors that the Familia Michoacana leader is still alive. After arresting Mario Buenrostro Quiroz, the alleged leader of a Mexico City-based drug gang known as ""Los Aboytes,"" local police videotaped an interrogation session with the suspect, which is standard procedure for law enforcement officials in the country. The interview (see below) proceeds routinely at first, with Buenrostro identifying several others who participated in a drug trafficking plot, until he begins to talk about his experience with the diminishing Familia Michoacana drug gang. After identifying himself as a member of the Familia, Buenrostro declares that Moreno , who federal officials claimed to have killed in a firefight last December, is still alive. Additionally, Buenrostro says that Moreno is now at the head of the Familia splinter group known as the Caballeros Templarios, and has named Servando Gomez, alias "" La Tuta ,"" as the group's second in command. This is not the first time that Moreno has been rumored to be alive. In June of this year, a series of narco-banners were hung up in three municipalities in the state of Guerrero, all of which bore messages proclaiming that Moreno was alive and in charge of the Caballeros Templarios. These rumors have been staunchly denied by the government, which maintains that Moreno was killed on December 9. In all likelihood, the rumors are part of a propaganda campaign on the part of the Caballeros Templarios. The group has been feuding with the Familia in recent months, so by claiming that group's founder as a member, they could be attempting to win more prestige for their organization. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Mexico Army Rescues 20 Hostages in Monterrey. The army freed 20 kidnap victims from a house in Monterrey, north Mexico, after receiving an anonymous tip. The hostages were found on Saturday. They were hand-cuffed, gagged and showed signs of torture. According to reports , some of hostages had been held for 11 days while their captors demanded between 5,000 and 50,000 pesos in ransom ($425 to $4,250). Security forces arrested a man guarding the victims, and handed him to Nuevo Leon state prosecutors. The army rescued another seven hostages in Monterrey in June , along with one man who had been beaten to death. Monterrey, a long-time drug trafficking hub, has been hit by high levels of violence since 2010 , when the Gulf Cartel split from their former security wing, the Zetas. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Report Reveals How Venezuela Gangs Control Their Turf. A recent report sheds light on the level of control that some Venezuelan gangs wield over their territory, and is also indicative of how some gangs may continue to receive local support in the face of police violence in certain communities. According to Spanish news agency EFE , 2016 has seen at least two cases of criminal bands enforcing a curfew and ordering local residents to stay home. At least one of those cases was apparently prompted by the alleged killing of a youth at the hands of Venezuela's investigative police (Cuerpo de Investigaciones Cientificas, Penales y Criminalisticas - CICPC), EFE reported. On February 4, fliers appeared in parts of Maracay, Aragua, warning residents to stay home and close their shops in protest of the killing. The flier was attributed to a local gang leader, alias ""El Chino Pedrera."" The flier also accused security forces of being corrupt. ""We are doing this publically because they call us delinquents, when many officials from supposedly moral institutions don't act morally,"" the flier stated. A similar incident took place on January 25 in the city of Porlamar, located on Margarita Island. After a prominent prison gang leader was killed , his allies issued an order that city residents stay inside while his funeral procession moved through the city, EFE reported. Roberto Briceno Leon, director of the Venezuelan Violence Observatory (Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia - OVV) told EFE that ""the level of criminal organization in Venezuela is replacing the state in some areas."" According to Briceno Leon, the ability of criminal groups to amass significant financial resources has allowed them to obtain powerful weaponry, take over territory, and control local populations. The cases described by EFE illustrate the amount of power wielded by gangs in parts of Venezuela. However, part of the reason criminal bands have come to control swathes of Venezuelan territory is the failure of officials and police to provide adequate security for communities. This is especially true in Caracas , where some residents have turned to private security or vigilante groups to help offset Venezuela's current security crisis. Exacerbating the issue is the Venezuelan police's frequent use of excessive force , fomenting distrust within communities exposed to abuses at the hands of government officials. For instance, allegations of extrajudicial killings by police have frequently surfaced, contributing to a cycle of retaliatory violence between criminals and security forces that catches innocent bystanders in the crossfire. An OVV survey also suggests many Venezuelans believe security forces themselves are involved in criminal activity , fueling an increasing sense of insecurity among citizens. Indeed, that criminal bands have become so well armed is partly due to corruption among security officials. For instance, two Venezuelan soldiers were recently arrested for partaking in the criminal theft of over 20 firearms and 2,400 bullets from a military arsenal in Aragua state."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Poised to Seize Record $1 Billion from Narco Brothers. The record seizure of hundreds of millions of dollars of assets in Colombia has raised the question of how two brothers linked to the Norte del Valle Cartel built up such power while remaining under the radar of the authorities. The case of the Alvarez Meyendorff brothers, apparent allies of some of the most notorious drug traffickers in Colombia's recent history, has cast suspicions on several top Colombian politicians, and demonstrated that it is not always the most famous players who wield the most power in the international drug trade. According to reports, Ignacio Alvarez Meyendorff -- all but unknown to the public until his arrest in Argentina in 2011 -- and younger brother Juan Fernando, who turned himself over to US authorities in April, worked closely with now-imprisoned drug traffickers including Daniel ""El Loco"" Barrera, leaders of the Rastrojos drug trafficking organization, and Victor Patino Fomeque, a key player in the defunct Cali and Norte Del Valle cartels. Yet the full extent of their influence was unknown until the recent confiscation of over 200 properties across ten of Colombia's 32 departments , with an estimated value in excess of $700 million, leading the official responsible for the raids to describe it as ""the biggest blow inflicted in the history of the Attorney General."" With 80 more properties coming under scrutiny, as well as 65 in Argentina, the total value of the brothers' assets could exceed $1 billion. Among those to appear on the titles of confiscated properties is former Senator and former President of Congress Dilian Francisca Toro , currently under detention amid an investigation into alleged money laundering and links to Patino. Other implicated politicians include former Senator Otto Nicolas Bula, who appears on the titles of two luxury properties, and Jorge E. Gomez, a former senator and well-known religious leader, who appears on six. The Meyendorff brothers are reported to have emerged in the Colombian underworld during the 1990s under the guidance of Victor Patino. This explains their links to the Norte del Valle Cartel and the Rastrojos, which both owe their origins to the Cali Cartel. By the 2000s, the Meyendorffs were working alongside Luis Agustin Caicedo Velandia, alias ""Don Lucho,"" and, according to El Espectador , operating ""on the same level"" as Daniel Barrera, prior to his September 2012 arrest in Venezuela. Alongside Don Lucho, Barrera and emerald trader Julio Lozano Pirateque, the brothers formed the so-called ""El Dorado Cartel,"" described by US authorities as a ""drug trafficking board of directors,"" which was apparently responsible for shipping up to eight tons of cocaine to the US and Europe each month. Ignacio has been described as the ""financial brain"" of the pair, while Juan Fernando, known as ""Mechas,"" was responsible for overseeing drug shipments and apparently pioneered the use of ""narco subs"" to move drugs northwards. The manner with which the two brothers were able to escape the notice of authorities for so long will be of some concern to both Colombian and US law enforcement. The pair joined the thriving community of expat drug lords living in Argentina in the mid-2000s, as the security forces cranked up the pressure on the drug trade within Colombia. Until his arrest, Ignacio had openly lived with his family in an upscale neighbourhood of Buenos Aires since 2005, where he built up and managed an extensive portfolio of business interests used to launder money. In 2008, he faced money laundering charges in Colombia but, according to Clarin , wrangling over how to process the case prevented its progress. The trail leading investigators to the Meyendorffs apparently began to emerge once an investigation into the finances of Bogota soccer club Santa Fe led to Don Lucho, arrested in June 2010, who had also been living undetected in Argentina. It has since been suggested that Don Lucho was the real power behind Barrera. It is unclear whether Don Lucho gave the brothers up, or whether investigators had been building a case against the Meyendorffs for some time. What is certain is that, alongside Don Lucho, the brothers remained largely unnoticed as they laundered up to $1.5 billion through Colombian soccer clubs , while Juan Fernando is accused of overseeing the shipment of some 68 tons of cocaine to the US between 2005 and 2010. Following his April 2011 arrest at an airport in northern Argentina, Ignacio was deported back to Colombia, where he awaits extradition to the US. Juan Fernando evaded capture until handing himself over to DEA agents in Haiti this year. While it is difficult to say exactly how the brothers amassed such wealth undetected, their move abroad was likely a key factor. It is possible that they saw other major Colombian drug traffickers elect to leave the country, and were savvy enough to follow suit before becoming major targets. It is also possible that the assets recovered by Colomba's Attorney General's Office were not all purchased with their own funds, but were intermingled with Patino's. The property incriminating former head of Congress Dilian Toro has been linked to both Ignacio Meyendorff and Patino, raising the possibility that Patino used Ignacio's low profile to cover some of his own illicit profits. Also unclear is the extent of the brothers' political connections. With prominent political figures already exposed by the investigation, it remains to be seen who else might be dragged into the limelight once Ignacio arrives in the US and begins talking to prosecutors."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"FARC Step Up Extortion; Multinationals Targeted. The recent arrest of the FARC 's alleged ""extortion mastermind"" shows that the guerrillas are intent on expanding a revenue stream which will make Colombia 's government very nervous: the extortion of multinational companies, with a special focus on the oil sector. Fardy Edilson Parra, alias ""Brayan,"" was reportedly arrested with more than 130 letters, addressed to a wide range of Colombian and multinational companies. He is accused of organizing extortion schemes for the Eastern Bloc of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), active in Colombia's richest oil-producing regions, including the departments of Caqueta and Meta. The papers found in Parra's possession appear to consist of a stock letter, each copy addressed to specific businesses and stamped with the FARC's logo. The text reportedly asks ""businessmen, oilmen, palm oil traders and ranchers"" to ""collaborate"" with the FARC's ""002 Law;"" a euphemism for extortion. Victims were told they had to send ""economic support"" of 200 to 500 million pesos (between $111,600 and $279,000) to the muncipality of La Uribe, the epicenter of the Eastern Bloc's activities in Meta. Recipients would have included the Colombian offices of international chains like Microsoft, Nike, and Toyota (presumably addressed to the companies' central offices in Bogota, if they were actually addressed at all). Others are reportedly local Colombian companies, ranging from beauty salons to lawyers' offices to transport companies. These include one of the FARC's most popular targets of extortion schemes: bus services like Flota Macarena and Expreso Bolivariano, whose vehicles are frequently burned and attacked when traveling through guerrilla territory. Flota Macarena, which serves Colombia's Eastern Plains, the stronghold of the FARC's Eastern Bloc, has reportedly had at least five buses destroyed while en route to Meta this year. The rebels are reportedly demanding that the company pay about 400,000 pesos (about $223) per bus, and another 400,000 pesos for each year that President Alvaro Uribe was in office (eight), during which, according to El Tiempo , the bus company paid the rebels nothing. But the FARC's intimidation of bus companies -- as well as extortion threats directed against other Colombian businesses and multinationals -- are nothing new. Extortion was the original money-earner for the FARC, long before the group moved into kidnapping and the drug trade in the late 1970s. Companies who are slow in paying the FARC's ""war tax"" feel the effects: Occidental Petroleum's Cano-Limon pipeline, for example, was bombed 170 times in 2001 alone , as the FARC and the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) attempted to extract payoffs from the multinational. What does appear new about the FARC's latest round of extortion efforts is the viciousness behind them. In one especially worrying development, a road bomb planted by the FARC killed one employee of a local subcontractor, GeoEnergy, and injured another five , after a company vehicle hit the explosive on August 3. The attack took place in San Vicente del Caguan, center of the FARC's safe haven during the 1999-2002 peace process.* It's unlikely that this attack was an accidental case of a improvised explosive device (IED) hitting the wrong car. One of the FARC's most experienced military units, the Teofilo Forero Column , is active in San Vicente. If an SUV belonging to an energy company hits a roadside bomb in this area -- a tactic which, so far this year, the FARC have used exclusively against the security forces, not civilians -- it was because the FARC were sending a deliberate message: pay up. There are plenty of signs indicating that the FARC intend to continue their campaign against oil multinationals, including mass kidnappings and* burned vehicles. But if this campaign turns more violent and we see an increase of similar IED attacks against oil company personnel, it won't necessarily be because the FARC want businesses to pay higher-than-usual ""vacunas,"" or extortion taxes. Rather, the intent seems to be to increase the pressure on President Juan Manuel Santos' administration, riding the wave of Colombia's current oil boom. Production is rising steadily and may hit one million barrels per day by the end of the year. Accompanying the surge is increased public resentment against the oil drillers in boomtowns like Meta's Puerto Gaitan, where oil subcontractors abused the labor force, sparking a wave of aggressive protests in late July. In some ways, the rebels' targeting of the oil trade is meant to hit the government where it hurts: that is, one of Colombia's fastest-growing (and most profitable) industries. It is also an attempt by the rebels to curry favor with sections of Colombia's progressive left, who by and large have no interest in establishing links to the rebels, but are hostile towards the increased rate of mining and oil exploration carried out by multinationals on Colombian ground. If oil production in Colombia wasn't entering such a golden age, it's doubtful that the FARC would have intensified their attacks against the sector. It's also doubtful that the extortion schemes allegedly carried out by alias ""Brayan"" were the rebels' real moneymakers. Letters to Colombia's local Nike office will probably yield the FARC few, if any, ""vacuna"" payments. The harassment and kidnapping of oil workers -- and the burning of company vehicles due to unpaid ransom -- is likely a great deal more effective, and something we may see more of, as Colombia's oil continues to gush.

"Top UN Rep Says Prisons Have Abandoned Rehabilitation. Prisons in Latin America have abandoned any notion of rehabilitating inmates, warned the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Torture, highlighting how penitentiary systems fuel insecurity and criminal groups across the region. Responding to video footage released last week showing decapitations inside a Brazilian jail, the UN's Juan Ernesto Mendez told Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper that prisoners left jails worse than when they entered. ""In Latin America () the situation is: put them in jail and close the door,"" he said. ""Many countries, like Brazil, have abandoned the idea of recuperation. We should all think it is a grave error to abandon social and moral recuperation."" Nations could not blame their lack of resources for their poor jails, said Mendez, because there were other countries in the world ""that have an exemplary and dignified penitentiary system [despite the fact] there is little money."" Staff at Pedrinhas jail in Brazil's northeastern state of Maranhao gave Folha de Sao Paulo a video last week showing prisoners posing next to decapitated bodies. A total of 62 inmates were killed inside Pedrinhas jail last year, reported CNN. Horrific violence and scores of prisoner deaths are par for the course every year in severely overcrowded and underfunded penitentiary systems across the region, which are frequently run by the inmates themselves. These so-called ""rehabilitation centers"" have mostly abandoned any notion of helping their prisoners re-enter society and do little to improve security. In Latin America, prisons more often become training and regrouping zones for organized crime. As Mendez points out, resources are only one issue that needs to be addressed. While the severe underfunding of Latin American prison facilities is a major cause of why they have gotten so out of control, a lack of political will to truly address the problem and a failure to understand what an effective prison system really entails, are perhaps the overarching roots of the issue."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Corruption Makes Peru Prison a Good Place to Commit Crimes. Prosecutors in Peru say a criminal group co-opted police and judicial officials so that it could continue running its operations from behind bars, an illustration of how corruption has helped turn prisons into hubs for illicit activity throughout Latin America. Anti-organized crime prosecutors allege that the criminal group known as ""La Gran Familia"" (""The Big Family""), a gang involved in an assortment of criminal activities, corrupted members of Peru's National Police in an attempt to obtain intelligence information and recover seized assets, reported Diario Correo. The prosecutors are asking for an oral trial of 37 suspects thought to belong to the group. Wiretaps conducted as part of the criminal investigation also revealed that the group penetrated the National Penitentiary Institute, which prosecutors say enabled the gang to smuggle in drugs, cellphones and other prohibited items. In addition, the Gran Familia's incarcerated leader, Angel Roman Leon Arevalo, alias ""Viejo Paco,"" allegedly established contacts within the Supreme Court for the northern city of Lambayeque in order to obtain favorable sentences for the group's members. Numerous Gran Familia operatives have been arrested, but at least two prominent members are still wanted by the authorities, according to Diario Correo. The group has also reportedly cultivated connections with extortion gangs in Colombia and Ecuador. Running operations from inside a prison offers criminal groups in Latin America a number of advantages. For one, criminal groups often gain de facto control over the facilities, which enables them to consolidate their organizational structure without facing violent reprisals from rivals. Prison-based groups have also managed to project their influence onto the streets; criminals want to be on good terms with the incarcerated bosses since they know there is a good chance they will have to share the same confined quarters at some point in the future. In the case of the Gran Familia, it appears the group relied on corrupting the authorities in order to protect their financial interests and ensure access to items like cellphones, which are often used to make extortion calls and conduct other illicit business. But the group is hardly alone in using this tactic, as a large number of extortion calls in countries from across the region emanate from within prison walls. Brazil's ruthless prison gangs, the incarcerated leaders of El Salvador's ""mara"" street gangs and Venezuela's "" pranes ,"" or prison bosses, are all examples of how organized crime has ironically flourished in institutions set up to punish and reform criminal behavior."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Honduras Top Cop Killed for Cachiros: US Prosecutor. Revelations from a drug trafficking case in New York illustrated the depth of police collusion with criminal groups in Honduras, which included murdering rivals and safeguarding drug loads. The information emerged in the case against Carlos Alberto Valladares Zuniga, a former Honduran police official facing sentencing in the Southern District of New York. As part of the accusation, Assistant US Attorney Emil Bove said Valladares --who was a regional commander of the special criminal investigations unit (Direccion Nacional de Investigacion Criminal - DNIC) in San Pedro Sula-- committed murder for the once powerful Cachiros drug trafficking organization, reported La Prensa. ""The defendant's conduct was not limited to simply helping transport narcotics or providing information to drug traffickers,"" Bove wrote in a September 10 letter addressed to the judge in the case. ""The defendant participated in several murders in furtherance of the drug-trafficking conspiracy."" On one occasion in October 2011, Valladares mounted a death squad partly composed of police officers to assassinate a Cachiros' rival known as ""El Sapo,"" or ""The Toad."" The former Honduran cop drove the then-Cachiros leader Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga ""so they could witness a mass attack on rival drug traffickers,"" reads Bove's letter. In a scene resembling that from a Hollywood movie, after arriving at the point of attack, the two men watched from a safe distance as a firefight left six dead. ""You're about to hear what war sounds like,"" Valladares told Rivera Maradiaga, according to La Prensa. Valladares, who pleaded guilty in May 2018 and admitted to conspiring with the Cachiros for nearly a decade, also recruited between eight and ten police commissioners for the Cachiros, according to El Heraldo. Once on the Cachiros' payroll, these commissioners were tasked with ensuring the safe passage of drug shipments. Valladares is among several former Honduran police officers to face US charges stemming from the testimony of Rivera Maradiaga, whose cooperation with the DEA has rocked Honduran elites and landed the son of former President Porfirio Lobo in jail. Last month, in a letter to the judge in charge of the case, Valladares' defense attorney admitted that his client ""made the terrible mistake of doing favors for the people who controlled drug trafficking with the active assistance of the Government of Honduras."" But the attorney argued that there was ""no turning back"" once the initial mistake had been made and asked for a lighter sentence of five years, rather than the 14 to 17.5 years the government prosecutor Bove recommended. ""It is clear that if he did not continue to work with Leonel Rivera and his associates, he would have been deemed a security risk and murdered,"" the defense lawyer's letter reads. The depth of corruption revealed by Bove's letter and the case, in general, is striking. By using even the highest ranks of the national police as recruitment pools to carry out the Cachiros' dirty work, Valladares illustrated what could be considered the deepest possible level of collusion between police and organized crime. Valladares' is not an isolated case. In 2014, the government shut down the entire DNIC and suspended its 1,400 employees due to suspected collusion with criminal groups. SEE ALSO : Honduras News and Profiles Such profound corruption has not disappeared in recent years. A special commission has purged over 5,000 police officers since 2016, many on suspicion of corruption. Omar Rivera, the head of the commission, recently told InSight Crime that police ties with organized crime in the country were ""historically institutionalized."" Rivera called it ""a fraternal relationship."" Despite the gravity of the situation, the political will needed to lastingly deal with corruption appears lacking. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez had promised to tackle the issue during his campaign in 2017, but his contested reelection has left him with little political capital. What's more, Hernandez' own brother has been implicated by Rivera Maradiaga's court testimony."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Is Mozambique Set to Become Africas Next Hub for LatAm Cocaine?A recent report has highlighted the increasing role of the East African nation Mozambique in the international drug trade, adding weight to warnings that the influence of Latin American criminals in Africa is no longer limited to a handful of west coast countries. The investigation, by Think Africa Press , explains how Mozambique's porous borders, extensive coastline and patchy governance have made it an increasingly popular transshipment point for international drug traffickers. Cocaine is typically smuggled into Mozambique by drug mules travelling by plane from Colombia and Brazil, while some also arrives by sea. Capture and seizure patterns at the airport of capital city Maputo indicate the majority of these mules are South African, Mozambican, Nigerian or Tanzanian nationals. Much of the cocaine then continues on to South Africa, which the report labels as the major regional consumer market, or is flown out to Europe and East Asia. The local sale of cocaine to Mozambican citizens and tourists has also growingly become a by-product of the drug trade. Some believe that efforts by authorities to thwart drug trafficking activities are compromised by corrupt security and government officials, and a lack of resources. The other main drugs transited through Mozambique are heroin, mandrax (a sedative) and marijuana, which are mainly shipped over from South Asia. In recent years, Africa has emerged as a popular transshipment point for Latin American cocaine traffickers, who take advantage of corrupt and ineffective security controls and the continent's proximity to the increasingly important European market. The West African nation of Guinea-Bissau has become the most notorious African drug hub, as top level corruption has turned the country into a bona fide narco-state. However, there have been warning signs that the presence of trafficking is expanding, with a 2013 report by the African Center for Strategic Studies (ACSS) highlighting how other countries in the region such as Mali, the Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and Mozambique, also risk falling into the clutches of the global drug trade. Mozambique's location on Africa's eastern coast makes it a less obvious option as a transit point for cocaine arriving from the Americas, particularly for drugs arriving via maritime routes. However, the information from the Think Africa Press report suggests traffickers are using different methods than those employed on the west coast, employing commercial flights and container ships rather than moving product themselves. In a report issued in late-2013 , Americas police association Ameripol highlighted the use of the coast of East Africa by traffickers, as part of a route passing through the Suez Canal. It is unclear whether the traffickers using Mozambique as a transit point are Latin American or African. While Latin American groups pioneered the use of the continent for trafficking, African organized crime groups -- particularly Nigerians -- are believed to be playing an increasing role in the cocaine trade.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Seizes 12 Tons of Cocaine Bound for Mexico+L438. Colombian authorities discovered 12 tons of cocaine in a container headed for Mexico, most likely a shipment from Colombia's Rastrojos to a Mexican cartel, while police simultaneously seized $2.8 million in cash, believed to be payment for a previous drug consignment. The cocaine, seized in the Caribbean port of Cartagena , was mixed with brown sugar, but detected by sniffer dogs. There were between 12 and 16 tons of the drug in the shipment, said the head of naval operations, Admiral Roberto Garcia Marquez. The exact amount will only be determined once chemists have finished analyzing the percentage of cocaine to sugar in the 33,450 blocks found in the container. The sugar came from Valle Del Cauca, the stronghold of the Rastrojos , one of Colombia's most powerful drug trafficking organizations. The anti-narcotics police believe the drug shipment belongs to Rastrojos boss Luis Enrique Calle Serna, alias "" Comba ."" The consignment was bound for Veracruz, Mexico's largest port on the Caribbean. This has traditionally been an area under the influence of the Gulf Cartel or the Zetas , although the Rastrojos have been linked to the Sinaloa Cartel in the past. When $27 million was found in a container in the Colombian port of Buenventura in 2009, on a ship that had arrived from Mexico, police believed it was part of a payment for drugs that the Rastrojos had sent to the Sinaloa Cartel. This haul is worth an estimated $360 million wholesale in the U.S., and its seizure represents a major blow to the drug trafficking organization behind the shipment. It is also one of the biggest interceptions of drugs in recent years, as traffickers now tend to move smaller shipments and often employ submarines , which are very difficult to detect. The last comparable seizure was in 2008, when 10.5 tons of cocaine were found in the nearby Caribbean port of Barranquilla. The use of a Caribbean port, away from the Rastrojos' principal area of operations along the Pacific coast, may signal a switch back towards the Atlantic seaboard, or show that the Rastrojos have managed to gain a foothold in Cartagena. While police in Cartagena were analyzing the cocaine-sugar mix, police at Bogota's international airport intercepted a Mexican carrying $2.8 million in cash , thought to be a payment for a previous cocaine shipment. The captured man, Jesus Ochoa Lugo, is from the city of Culiacan in Sinaloa, and authorities believe that the money is from the Sinaloa Cartel and its leader Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias "" El Chapo. "" The Mexican cartels have taken a more prominent role in the regional drug trade over the last ten years. Whereas historically Colombian cartels controlled much of the traffic, from coca plant to street distribution, the Mexicans now have a stranglehold on the trade, at least to the U.S. market. Colombian groups now tend to sell their product to the Mexicans, who are responsible for smuggling it into the U.S. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Task Force Takes Over Security in Honduras Troubled Colon Province. A hybrid military-police task force has been put in charge of providing security in Honduras' embattled northern province of Colon, home to strategic drug smuggling corridors and a violent land conflict. The Xatruch III Task Force, comprised of both military and law enforcement elements , assumed control over security in Colon on August 15, Proceso reports. Daniel Molina, official spokesperson for the task force, said that the operation involves the deployment of an unspecified number of additional security forces to the area. According to Molina, the task force is the brainchild of Honduras' controversial new National Police commander, Juan Carlos Bonilla. It will be led by national police commissioner Leonel Armando Alvarado. VIolence in the region has drawn the attention of Honduran lawmakers, who passed a law recently banning the public possession of firearms there. Colon is an important corridor for drug flights entering and leaving the country, and its roughly 150 kilometers of coastline along the Caribbean are frequented by go-fast boats transporting large amounts of cocaine. The province is also the site of a land struggle between small farmers and large land owners in the Bajo Aguan region. Human rights groups accuse private security guards and local police of waging a violent campaign against activists and small farmers there. At least 55 people have been killed , mostly farmers, in Bajo Aguan since 2009 as a result of the violence. Because police have been implicated as a party in the conflict, it is not clear whether the presence of more security forces will bring down violence in Colon. In reference to this, Molina said that the task force would take no sides in the conflict other than enforcing the law. ""This is to be a pacifying force,"" he said. ""We are a force that will hear both parties, to assist them in reaching an agreement on peaceful coexistence supported by us as in accordance with our responsibilities under the law."" But security forces themselves have come under attack by armed groups in Colon as well. A military convoy was ambushed by unknown individuals in March, seriously injuring five soldiers. Such attacks may increase with the addition of more troops to the area. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Kingpin Accused by US Will Turn Himself In: Reports. An alleged drug trafficker suspected of ties to numerous corrupt officials in Honduras is reportedly preparing to turn himself in, but just where he would be prosecuted remains an unanswered question. Citing an unnamed source with close ties to law enforcement, television network HCH reported on October 17, that Wilter Blanco, the alleged leader of the Atlantic Cartel, would turn himself in to authorities ""in the next 24 hours."" A spokesperson for the Honduran police, however, dismissed the report. ""We don't see support for that information that came out in the media,"" the spokesperson told La Prensa. ""We are following this case and any information is of utmost importance."" The report from HCH came the same day as a US federal court ordered the unsealing of an indictment charging Blanco with involvement in a cocaine trafficking conspiracy stretching back to at least 1999. The indictment of Blanco was originally filed on August 5, 2016, but it remained sealed based on prosecutors' belief that keeping it under seal ""would assist in arresting the Defendant."" However, the prosecution requested that the court unseal the document on October 12, saying, ""the Government no longer believes that keeping the Indictment under seal will help with the arrest."" The unsealing of the indictment and the reports of Blanco's impending surrender come just over a week after the US Embassy in Honduras made the extraordinary announcement that Blanco was under investigation for drug trafficking and corruption along with several other suspects, including members of the Honduran armed forces. In addition, local media outlets have reported that mayors, members of congress, judges, business owners and police officers in Honduras are also being investigated for suspected corruption tied to Blanco's alleged drug trafficking network, though this has not been officially confirmed. Perhaps most explosively, US authorities appear to suspect that Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernandez, the brother of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, is also involved in drug trafficking activities. A US embassy official who requested anonymity recently told InSight Crime that Tony Hernandez is a ""person of interest."" As of this writing, it does not appear that Blanco has handed himself over to authorities, nor has HCH's report been independently confirmed. While Blanco may turn himself in, it is not clear who will prosecute him. Undoubtedly, US authorities would seek his extradition, especially given the amount of information he may have on other suspects, including political and economic elites in Honduras. But an Attorney General's Office prosecutor told InSight Crime that Blanco is facing money laundering charges in Honduras and according to Honduran law, he would have to finish his case in country prior to being extradited. Given the pressure Blanco is facing in Honduras, it is possible that he may opt to negotiate his surrender in a third country. There is a precedent for this type of maneuver. Following increased pressure from the United States, the leaders of the Cachiros criminal group surrendered in early 2015 to US law enforcement. Local press reports subsequently suggested that the suspects were seeking benefits for their family members in exchange for providing information to US authorities, as well as a safe landing for themselves; one of their key associates had been murdered just days prior to their surrender. Within months of the Cachiros' surrender, the United States brought drug trafficking and money laundering charges against members of one of Honduras' wealthiest and most politically powerful families, the Rosenthals, who were linked to the Cachiros' operations. Other Honduran suspects in US custody already appear to have provided information related to the Blanco case. According to local media reports, five police officers extradited to the United States in July to face drug and arms trafficking charges have provided such information."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Must Break the Cycle of Impunity: UN Rep. The United Nations has it eyes set on El Salvador. In a period of a few months, four of its top experts visited the country, returning with largely damning assessments of the human rights impact of the government's harsh anti-gang policies. But questions remain as to whether Salvadoran officials -- who seem set on an ""iron fist"" approach to the country's increasingly volatile security situation -- will listen to these critiques. In the most recent of the visits by UN representatives, which ended last week, the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions, Agnes Callamard, said that El Salvador's program of ""extraordinary measures"" for prisons violates human rights , and that the country has been unable to effectively deal with increasing violence at the hands of its security forces. The measures -- which allow for prolonged isolation of prisoners, suspension of hearings and visitations, and blocking of phone signals around prisons -- went into force in April 2016 and have been repeatedly extended. Authorities are seeking congressional approval for another renewal, which is likely to pass due to widespread support among the two main political parties. The program is part of a wider set of heavy-handed security policies that prioritize repressive measures to tackle violent gangs. The government of President Salvador Sanchez Ceren claims these measures helped achieve a 21 point reduction in the country's homicide rate last year. Nevertheless, El Salvador still ranks as one of the most violent on earth, with 60 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2017. But local civil society organizations and UN experts have expressed reservations about the effect this approach is having on human rights. They said the extraordinary measures in prisons have caused a spike in cases of tuberculosis among inmates, and reported a concerning number of cases of sometimes deadly violence at the hands of security forces. A day after Callamard left El Salvador, officials from the national prison system said they were implementing some of the experts' recommendations, including separating gang members according to their ""level of dangerousness,"" and keeping gang leaders away from other prisoners. However, both Prisons Director Marco Tulo Lima and Vice President Oscar Ortiz said they did not agree with the proposal to suspend the ""extraordinary measures,"" and insisted the policies are having a positive impact on the security situation in the Central American country. After her 12-day visit to the country, Callamard spoke to InSight Crime about her preliminary conclusions, the potential short-term impact of upcoming elections on security programs, and the need to tackle deep-rooted impunity in one of the most violent countries on Earth. An edited transcript of the conversation appears below. InSight Crime: The United Nations seems to have its eyes set on El Salvador. Do the visits respond to a deteriorating situation? Agnes Callamard: El Salvador has been on my radar since I started as a Special Rapporteur [in August 2016] because of the allegations I have received of excessive use of force and extrajudicial killings. It is one of those countries that are battling unconventional violence and using possible excessive force in their responses. The country had been neglected by the United Nations in terms of its human rights monitoring for some time, and international human rights organizations were not very present, so I thought it would be important for me to go there. IC: You spent nearly two weeks in El Salvador, in the midst of a deepening security crisis, how would you describe what you saw? AC: I have found that the violence is endemic and systemic. That violence translates into real fear for people so there is this impression that repressive measures are the only way to respond to this situation. According to the polls I have read, society in general seems to prefer an ""iron fist"" strategy even though, so far, that strategy has not delivered any tangible outcome as far as the violence, peace and security are concerned. I found that some of the discourse that I have come across is borderline or full-on incitement to violence. I don't think there is enough discussion and space to debate alternative proposals, which I think is unfortunate. IC: Why do you think this is happening? AC: There is a hunger for solutions, but a very limited public space to allow for open discussion of the various options and possibilities. People fall back on what I find to be the same old policies predicated on militarization of policing and mass imprisonment. The political sector and other members of society should be able to talk about the country's security strategy and all of its dimensions, including in terms of rehabilitation and reintegration, in an open and informed fashion. But I have found these are very difficult topics, particularly in a pre-electoral context. [El Salvador will hold legislative and municipal elections on March 4.] IC: How would you evaluate the alternative solutions you have come across, and why do you think they don't fully resolve the problems El Salvador is facing? AC: I should say that the government has been brave in proposing at least two policies which, in my view, are breaking with the approach we have seen over the last 15 years: "" El Salvador Seguro "" [""Safe El Salvador""] which on paper has very good measures which are not aiming at repression, and the Yo Cambio [""I Change""] program of rehabilitation for detainees which is also very interesting. I think the government has been committed to exploring alternative solutions in parallel to the repressive measures. I suspect that there is a political understanding that repression alone cannot deliver tangible outcomes for the population as far as security is concerned. Unfortunately, for a range of reasons which were beyond the scope of my mission, those alternative measures are not well resourced and they are politically costly in that the population does not understand them and appears to be more geared toward ""iron fist"" responses. So this does not encourage the government to push for and resource these programs well. IC: Why do you think these programs are not fully resourced? AC: The political cost can be one of the reasons why these programs are not properly debated or resourced but I haven't investigated all the reasons for the lack of resourcing. We need to acknowledge that El Salvador has a small public budget and that difficult decisions need to be made about how to allocate it but I do regret the fact that 80 percent of the special taxes that were put in place to resource El Salvador Seguro, for example, has gone towards the police and the army. IC: You visited a number of prisons under the regime of ""extraordinary measures"" -- prisons not even the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has had access to. And you said they were some of the ""worst you had ever seen."" Can you tell us more? AC: The prisons are pretty hellish. I went to a prison under extraordinary measures, an old one and a newer one that is going through some changes. In the old prison the overcrowding is very striking. There are so many people there that many have to take turns to sit or sleep. They are not able to go outside for days and weeks, they do not have access to a stall, the diet is poor, some people are very ill and only have access to poor services, and there is a tuberculosis epidemic. The government is taking measures to tackle some of the tuberculosis, and when I visited the prison I could see some of the measures they were taking. We will have to wait until we get the final number in a month or two to see whether the death rate starts to go down. The second prison I visited was very different. There was no overcrowding, there were six inmates per cell and the cell had six beds. They were still not able to see the sun much or go outside, and as far as I understand the diet was not great either. But in those new prisons that have been built, the problem of overcrowding has been addressed with the exception of some cells. However, there are more measures that need to be taken with regards to access to the sun, exercise, a stall, a good diet and so on. I have called on the government to allow the ICRC to access all prisons without any kind of limits. I believe they will be able to provide the government and the prison authorities with a range of recommendations on how to tackle the impact of the extraordinary measures on the inmate's health and well-being. IC: The government claims the ""extraordinary measures"" in prisons are helping tackle violence. How would you respond? AC: From the short-term standpoint, in my view, the extraordinary measures are inhumane. And from a long-term standpoint, I suspect they are creating far more problems than solutions. Anyone under the prison conditions that I have seen is unlikely to get out a better person. Frankly, prison should aim at punishing for wrongdoing, but it should also give people the time and tools so they do not fall back into their old ways. The Yo Cambio program, which is being tested in a number of prisons, should be implemented in the prisons under extraordinary measures. Inmates told me they are very keen to be involved in Yo Cambio and to learn new skills. IC: The government says it needs to take back control of the prisons from gangs. Do you agree? AC: I have told the government repeatedly that I do not oppose the extraordinary measures that have a good security rational, including to controlling the prisons. I have not said anything about the need to control communications, for instance, because I understand the need on the part of the police to do so. I do question, however, the way in which those objectives are being implemented. Controlling the prison is a necessity but I think that some of the measures have no security proposes, but rather are aimed at dehumanizing the inmates, and that's where I draw the line. IC: Some people argue that the measures that dehumanize prisoners actually fuel criminal organizations, making them stronger. Is this criticism valid? AC: I don't know, I'm not an expert on that. I have not investigated the impact of the dehumanization efforts. I cannot comment on that. IC: One of the issues that has generated a lot of attention lately, and prompted your visit, is the allegations of extrajudicial killings. Have you found a state policy towards this? AC: I'm not suggesting that. What I'm saying is that there is a pattern of behavior amounting to extrajudicial killings or excessive use of force, and this pattern is reinforced or fed by the weak institutional responses, particularly at the investigative and judicial level. IC: You said that impunity fuels some of these allegations of abuse. Can you explain? AC: I think it's important to recognize that there is a high rate of impunity regarding allegations of police and army killings, but there is a high rate of impunity across the board in the country. So this is not dissimilar to the rate of killings you find, for example, for killings of women or for the killing of LGBTQI persons and for a range of other crimes. This is why I'm suggesting that the weak institutions -- both in terms of investigations and the justice system -- are feeding the behaviors I have identified. IC: How do you go about tackling the lack of a strong judiciary in a country that has faced endemic impunity for decades? AC: First of all, I would focus on the allegations of violence by the police and the army. I think this kind of violence presents specific challenges and characteristics. Of course there need to be very strong mechanisms to prevent violence from being used in the first place. This includes tackling the lack of resources for the protection of police officers, the fact that for example they don't have protective vests, some of the moral issues I have seen, the need for better training on techniques for confrontations with gangs, and so on. However, of course, tackling impunity is going to be key. The authorities need to really begin by ensuring that at least some of the cases that have been publicly reported have a proper review by judges. IC: Can you pinpoint where the main obstacles for justice are? AC: There have been a number of instances where police officers have gone to the sentencing stage but judges have shied away from sentencing them. So at some level, investigations have delivered, at least in 50 percent of the cases that have gone through the investigative judges, there have been missed opportunities as well as missed opportunities at the sentencing level. It's not as if there haven't been cases going to court. But in my view, there is an impunity bottleneck beginning at the entry point, at the first investigation. From a systemic standpoint, authorities really need to understand this bottleneck and they need to address it. But in the meantime, they should be able to process at least one case seriously to demonstrate that this kind of abuse of power will not be tolerated, and continue to progress form there. IC: That will take a long-term commitment from the authorities and the country as a whole. Do you think it's possible? AC: There is no quick fix for this problem. If we insist on a quick fix we are going to fall into the same pattern that we have seen with the response to the violence. It needs to be addressed systematically, with solutions geared towards the institutions themselves. Whether or not there needs to be special judges appointed for the kind of allegations related to the police or to the army, that is something that could be explored. I believe that the resources to investigate the military and the police should be increased. And of course these are difficult decisions, not very popular to explain. But in my view, whenever the state institutions in charge of security or some of their members act in a rough fashion, this is a very dangerous path for a country. IC: What other recommendations are you looking to put forward to the authorities? AC: I don't have all my recommendations yet. The final report will be done in a month or so, at which stage I hope to have more detailed recommendations in terms of how the judicial and investigative institutions should respond to the impunity. But ultimately it is about providing good evidence, having judges that are not afraid of indicting police officers, protecting these judges from very unpopular decisions and ensuring that internally within those institutions there are mechanisms that allow the gathering of the required evidence to demonstrate extrajudicial executions or excessive use of force. IC: Do you think that there is the will and environment that will allow at least some of these changes to take place in El Salvador? AC: I think we will have to wait for the post-election period. At the moment, all political actors are focusing on the elections. The political will is hard for me to assess. During my mission, I saw a range of measures to address some aspects of the extraordinary measures. I was shown a number of initiatives that seek to provide rehabilitation and reintegration, particularly in the prisons. Whether of not this was done for my visit, rather than a more committed response to the abuses that have taken place as part of the official response that I cannot tell. The management of the expectations of society will be very crucial but the definition of madness is to keep doing the same thing and expect a different outcome. I hope that in El Salvador, people will move away from going mad because repeating the same iron fist policy will not deliver a different outcome than it has over the last ten years. IC: You talked about ensuring justice on one case and learning from it as a path to a solution. How would that work? AC: We are only one step, one good decision away from breaking the cycle of impunity. It's clearly not enough to solve one case, but it is at least enough to break this cycle and to send a signal that killings by security personnel are not acceptable. Clearly one case is not enough, but it is where we start. IC: Do you think the current environment in El Salvador will allow for this cycle of impunity to be broken and some of these issues tackled? AC: I think there is hope. The transition process after the civil war has taken a long time but right now there are signs that things are moving. I hope we will not have to wait another 30 years for some justice. I think there are good people of good will. Civil society and the legal community are really trying to build strong cases, they need the support of people including from the international community to really build those cases in a way that it makes them bulletproof in the judicial system. There are judges committed to upholding the rule of law. They also have a role to play and they need to be encouraged to do that."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Busts Over 100 FARC Cocaine Labs. Colombia has destroyed over 100 cocaine laboratories and stripped a FARC faction of $10 million in potential earnings, exposing the huge criminal finances that promise to keep many guerrilla fighters in the field even if a peace deal is reached in the near future. Colombian police have destroyed 104 clandestine laboratories capable of producing over 75 metric tons of cocaine per year in the remote eastern region of Guaviare department. The structures were run by the 1st Front (or ""Armando Rios"" Front) of guerrilla organization the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), Caracol Radio reported after visiting the jungle region. The FARC faction would have allegedly earned around $10 million from the laboratories over the course of the year. During the five-day operation, 120 members of the Anti-Narcotics Police and Air Force seized 1.7 metric tons of coca base, 38 metric tons of coca leaf, 5.5 metric tons of chemicals and 16,000 gallons of gasoline, ingredients essential for making cocaine. Caracol Radio reported that local coca farmers were forced to sell their product to the guerrilla group. For every kilogram of cocaine sold, the front's leadership received 150 grams' worth of the profits. From Guaviare, the cocaine was smuggled into Venezuela and Brazil before being trafficked around the world, according to the police. In northern Guaviare, the 1st Front has business deals with Brazilian, Peruvian and Venezuelan drug trafficking groups, as well as the Colombian organizations known as the Urabenos and the Puntilleros -- the latter referring to former paramilitary groups operating in the country's Eastern Plains region. Caracol Radio added that the value of coca base in Guaviare surged from $161 per kilogram to $805 following the police operation, and will continue to rise. The bust is part of new government strategy that aims to weaken the early production stages of the drug suply chain, reported Reuters. The 1st Front has been emblematic of the problems the FARC's criminal empire pose as the guerrilla group nears a final peace agreement with the Colombian government. In July 2016, the faction declared that it would ignore eventual orders to demobilize, claiming its insurgents would continue ""fighting to seize power for the people."" But this huge seizure is strong proof that -- as had been widely suggested -- the 1st Front's resistance to the peace process has more to do with the criminal profits it would lose out on rather than an ideological struggle. SEE ALSO : Coverage of FARC Peace Following the 1st Front's announcement, specialists pointed out that the group makes a significant amount of money from drug crop cultivation, laboratories and trafficking routes into Venezuela, as well as illegal mining. The FARC leadership was quick to distance itself from the breakaway faction, stating that it was using ""political arguments with the aim of disguising the clear influence of financial interests that are averse to the end of the conflict."" The recent anti-drug operation in Guaviare appears to be part of a recent shift in Colombia's anti-drug policy, which looks to increasingly target cocaine laboratories rather than coca fields. The bust may also serve as a show of state force against other dissident factions of the rebel group. President Juan Manuel Santos has repeatedly said that the only options for fighters who refuse to demobilize will be prison or the grave."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Official Signals Shift Away from Militarized Security Strategy. Mexico's Interior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong recently said that long-term security gains in the country will depend on improving socioeconomic conditions, signaling a possible shift away from the heavy-handed anti-crime strategy the government has pursued for years. According to a government press release , Osorio Chong said Mexico is moving away from all-out combat against criminal groups and toward policies aimed at creating a ""strong social fabric"" and generating ""effective opportunities for individual and collective development."" Osorio Chong made the comments at the Second Mexico-European Union Public Security and Law Enforcement Dialogue. The Interior Secretary also highlighted the importance of improving human rights protections, reforming the judicial and penal systems, and strengthening local security institutions. Osorio Chong's comments come as Mexico experiences an increase in criminal violence. A recent report from the Mexican organization Semaforo Delictivo documented a 15 percent increase in murders related to organized crime during the first four months of this year. Kidnappings and extortion, on the other hand, fell slightly during that time period. Osorio Chong's remarks seem to indicate an acknowledgement that dealing with Mexico's complex security challenges will require taking a holistic approach. This is more easily said than done, however, especially given the deeply-ingrained nature of the country's current security strategy. As a recent report from the New York Times points out, Mexico's military has played a key role in combating the country's drug cartels for nearly a decade. But the involvement of the armed forces in anti-crime efforts has been marred by well-substantiated allegations of serious human rights abuses including torture and extrajudicial killings, for which accountability has often proven elusive. The head of Mexico 's National Defense Secretariat recently called the deployment of troops to take on drug traffickers a "" mistake ."" And yet, Mexico has struggled to reduce the military's role in domestic security. Despite promising a greater focus on so-called ""softer"" approaches such as violence reduction and crime prevention, President Enrique Enrique Pena Nieto has continued to rely on federal troops, especially in areas with a strong organized crime presence. The reasons for the continued militarization of Mexico's internal security are manifold , but at the top of the list are the country's weak and corrupt police forces. According to a 2014 report from the Wilson Center citing Mexican government statistics from 2012 ( pdf ), most Mexican citizens have little or no trust in federal, state and local police. Politicians are therefore encouraged to choose short-term solutions such as troop surges rather than more sustainable security strategies."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Admits that its Drug Gangs Are in Bolivia. Colombia's government has confirmed the presence of Colombian drug trafficking organizations in Bolivia, saying that it will work with the neighboring government to tackle this phenomenon. Speaking in the Bolivian city of Tiquipaya, Colombian Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin said that her government knew of the presence of Colombian groups in Bolivia, but that she could not name which groups they were. She said that Colombia's success in fighting trafficking could sometimes have a negative impact on other countries, and for that reason the country had a policy of working with others to help them combat the drug trade, reports AFP On Tuesday, the two countries signed an agreement to support one another in matters of defense and in fighting drug trafficking, reports Bolivian newspaper La Estrella del Oriente. Bolivia's government has repeatedly denied that foreign drug trafficking groups have a presence inside the country, arguing that they may have ""representatives"" but not a permanent, militarized presence which qualifies as a cartel. However, according to Senate testimony by a US anti-drug agent , both Mexican and Colombian traffickers are increasing their presence in the country. Last year, an anonymous Colombian intelligence official claimed that there were up to 3,000 Colombian drug traffickers in the east Bolivian department of Santa Cruz. These groups are likely drawn to the neighboring country because of its status as an important coca producer and its strategic location between Colombia and Brazil, an export hub and cocaine consumer. Another reason for Colombian traffickers to relocate to Bolivia is pressure from the security forces in their home country, as Holguin suggested. The security improvements in Colombia in the last 10 years have caused many top capos to relocated operations abroad, in a manifestation of the ""balloon effect,"" in which victories against the drug trade in one country or region simply cause it to expand elsewhere. The issue is particularly sensitive, as the US has accused the Morales government, which supports the cultivation of coca for traditional purposes, of failing to do enough to fight the cocaine trade.

"US Senator Injects Uncertainty Into Guatemala Anti-Corruption Fight. In a move that could imperil anti-corruption efforts in Guatemala, US Senator Marco Rubio said he has halted funding for the United Nations-backed judicial body, CICIG. The extraordinary decision by Rubio (R-FL) -- who is the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, and a member of the Appropriations Committee -- was dated May 4. The US Senator said the decision -- which his office says is ""a hold"" on $6 million in funding -- was related to the role the International Commission Against in Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG) played in helping to prosecute the Bitkov family in that country. The Bitkovs, who are Russian millionaires, were connected to the so-called ""Migration Case,"" in which 39 people were sentenced as part of a vast illicit scheme to furnish fake and doctored identification. Three members of the Bitkov family were found guilty of obtaining false papers and forging others on numerous occasions in order to establish and maintain residence in Guatemala since 2009. The Bitkovs say they were victims of a criminal ring, and in April, Guatemala's Constitutional Court partially reversed the verdict , forcing prosecutors to re-establish grounds to try the family in Guatemalan court. Rubio -- and others , including Bill Browder , a US businessman who made significant sums of money while living in Russia, and Mary Anastasia O'Grady of the Wall Street Journal -- have suggested the CICIG was manipulated or possibly even working with the Russian government of Vladimir Putin, who the Bitkovs say persecuted them in Russia. ( Prensa Libre, citing Russian press , said the Bitkov family may have defrauded its company's stockholders of as much as $6 million and fled potential prosecution.) The CICIG did not respond to Rubio's statement, but in a detailed description of its role in the Bitkov matter issued days before, the commission said it only entered as a ""joint plaintiff"" in the Migration Case in 2014 and has had no connection to the Russian government. ""The Commission acts with full independence, adherence to its mandate and respect for Guatemalan law,"" the commission's explanation reads. ""CICIG's investigations are not conditioned by their donors or any other external entity. Please note that the Russian Federation is not -- and has not been is the past -- a donor to this Commission. CICIG has had no relation with the Russian Federation."" The statement by Rubio and potential hold on the commission's funding is a serious escalation of the battle between the forces of anti-corruption in Guatemala like the CICIG and the Attorney General's Office, and their foes, which include President Jimmy Morales and others, who like Morales have come under investigation for corrupt and criminal practices. Rubio followed his statement with a letter to Morales, asking him to keep a close eye on the Bitkov family and the CICIG. ""I am troubled by the role of the International Commission on [sic] Impunity in Guatemala [CICIG] in this affair,"" he wrote. Morales may read this as a green light to continue his overt efforts to rid himself of the Commission, which has helped push cases against him, his family and his political party. The CICIG has operated as a super-technical assistant to the Guatemalan Attorney General's Office on high level corruption and crime cases since 2007. It has assisted prosecutors in jailing top officials of current and past governments, including two former presidents and a vice president, whose cases are ongoing. The US government has traditionally provided close to half of its estimated $15 million annual budget, and has regularly lauded its efforts over the years, as well backed it up when corrupt leaders have tried to shelve the body, including in recent weeks when the US Ambassador to Guatemala took a photo with the CICIG's Commissioner. "" EEUU apoya con firmeza a la CICIGgt y al Comisionado Ivan_Velasquez_ "" EmbArreaga pic.twitter.com/l2enWeu1Mc -- US Embassy Guatemala (usembassyguate) February 6, 2018 Even one of Bitkov's lawyers does not agree with Rubio's interpretation of role of the CICIG. ""Some people are taking advantage of us,"" Jose Rolando Alvarado told Nomada days before Rubio's statement. ""We are not against the CICIG."" The irony is also thick considering Rubio's stated concerns about how criminal and terrorist groups can take advantage of lax and corrupt migration systems in Central America. According to the CICIG's statement on the Bitkov matter, the Migration Case was ""internationally praised for having dismantled a large network that posed a risk to national and regional security."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Overview of Violence Against Social Leaders in Colombia. Social leaders across Colombia were murdered at an almost unprecedented rate in 2019, and for a wide range of causes. Criminal gangs seeking to protect their illegal economies, such as drug traffickers and illegal mining, have been the main culprits. But demobilized guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), politicians, land defenders, and Indigenous leaders have all been targeted, making specific reasons difficult to pin down. Below, InSight Crime looks at these murders in Putumayo, Narino, Antioquia, Cauca and Norte de Santander, the five Colombian departments most impacted by this spike in violence, as well as the difficulty in knowing exactly how many leaders have been targeted. Uncertainty About the Numbers A number of organizations monitor this issue closely, including Colombia's Attorney General's Office, the United Nations and a range of civil society groups. But due to the difficulty in gathering reliable information about how and when these murders occur, statistics can vary widely. A total of 872 social leaders and human rights defenders were killed in Colombia between January 1, 2016 and September 8, 2019, according to the Institute for Development and Peace Studies ( Instituto de Estudios para el Desarrollo y la Paz -- INDEPAZ). This breaks down to 132 murders in 2016, 208 in 2017, 282 in 2018 and a slight drop to 250 reported killings in 2019. But according to Diana Sanchez, director of the human rights organization Programa Somos Defensores (We Are Defenders Program), the phenomenon is actually under-reported. ""We have detected a trend of underestimating the number of murders. A few years ago, they were explained away as matters of passion or territory disputes. Then they were related to coca crops and drug trafficking. Now they say that they [those killed] were not social leaders or human rights defenders,"" Sanchez commented to Deutsche Welle. This disparity in the numbers has meant that a lot of attention has been placed on the statistics , detracting focus from why these killings were happening in the first place. The motivations are related to the work done by Colombian social leaders to promote the implementation of the 2016 peace accords between the government and the FARC, as well as their efforts to stem the flow of illegal economies within their territories. In many cases, the leaders killed were involved in efforts to offer alternatives to coca farmers, such as crop substitution programs or land redistribution. They are also attacked for defending their territories' natural resources, particularly in standing against illegal mining or logging, or defending their use of water sources. As a result of the compromise reached as part of the peace agreement, many former FARC combatants have also become the targets of threats, murders and other forms of violence on the part of different armed groups and state forces. Among the reasons behind these attacks are refusing to return to illegal activities, promoting crop substitution and the mistrust of armed actors operating within the same territory. During an interview with the newspaper El Pais , Martha Mancera, director of the Unit to Dismantle Criminal Gangs within the Attorney General's Office, stated that 2019 closed with 132 murders of former FARC combatants, nine of whom were victims of forced displacement, 107 were homicide victims and 16 were classified as attempted murders. Additionally, at least 41 family members of demobilized FARC fighters were also murdered within the same time frame. In 2017, 15 instances were reported, while 11 were reported in 2018 and 15 in 2019. While this violence has reached different corners of Colombia, the criminal dynamics in the following five regions have intensified the most over the past year. Bajo Cauca: A War Zone In this region of Antioquia department, made up of the municipalities of Zaragoza, Nechi, Caceres, Taraza, El Bagre and Caucasia, Colombia's war hasn't let up since 2016. Even before the signing of the FARC's peace agreement in 2016, Bajo Cauca was one of the most troubled areas in Colombia. Two groups are responsible for the incessant homicides and forced displacements: El Bloque Virgilio Peralta, or the Caparrapos , and the Urabenos. There are also reports of the presence of dissidents of the FARC's 18th and 36th Fronts, as well as the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional -- ELN ). The dispute is currently being waged between the Urabenos and the Caparrapos -- which broke off from the Urabenos at the end of 2017 -- to ensure control of illicit economies like illegal mining, drug trafficking and extortion in areas like Taraza. The burnt vehicle in which the body of mayoral candidate Karina Garcia who was found in Suarez, Colombia, on September 2, 2019 About 30 homicides occurred in Bajo Cauca within just the first 20 days of January 2020, with Taraza and Caceres being the municipalities most affected. Two of these victims, killed in the rural Guaimaro de Taraza settlement, were community leaders. Pedro Alexander San Pedro and Carlos Andres Chavarria belonged to the National Comprehensive Program for the Substitution of Illicit Crops (Programa Nacional Integral de Sustitucion de Cultivos Ilicitos -- PNIS). Norte de Santander: The Coca Stronghold According to a recent report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) , with 33,568 hectares of coca crops, Norte de Santander has the second greatest coca crop coverage in Colombia after Narino. This has made it a highly demanded corridor for smuggling drugs and contraband in and out of Venezuela, with which it shares a border. In its northern region of Catatumbo, the ELN's Northeastern War Front (Frente de Guerra Nororiental), the 33rd Front of the ex-FARC Mafia, the Popular Liberation Army (Ejercito Popular de Liberacion -- EPL ) and the Rastrojos all have a strong presence. The ELN and the EPL have been fighting a particularly bloody war there. Following the signing of the peace agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC in 2016, 42 social leaders and human rights defenders have been murdered here, according to statistics from INDEPAZ. The motivation behind these murders is largely related to the realignment that has taken place within all these groups, which are vying to benefit from coca, contraband, extortion and arms trafficking. Despite the national government having regularly increased its military presence in the region, there are no signs of the violence decreasing. Two social leaders have already been assassinated in 2020 alone: Cesar Tulio Sandoval Chia in Tibu and Fernando Quintero Mena in Convencion. Cauca: The Murder Epicenter The department hardest hit by the assassinations of social leaders in 2019 was Cauca, with 36 cases as of October. In the first three weeks of 2020, at least three victims were reported, with the most recent murder taking place in the municipality of Guapi. While the situation is critical across the department, the dynamic of violence is different in each area. Northern Cauca is under the control of FARC dissidents, specifically the Dagoberto Ramos Mobile Column, led by ""El Indio,"" and the Jaime Martinez Mobile Column, led by alias ""Mayimbu."" The latter i s allegedly responsible for at least two massacres in November 2019, including the high-profile murder of mayoral candidate Karina Garcia in Suarez municipality. Both groups maintain a non-aggression and cooperation pact in the department, where they run illegal mining and drug trafficking operations. They also control important routes, such as one heading down from Jamundi in the Valle del Cauca towards northern Cauca and the Naya River corridor leading to the Pacific Ocean. Unlike the municipalities close to the Pacific, where violence has not been as severe, the situation in northern Cauca has intensified due to Indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities opposing their lands being used for coca crop cultivation and illegal mining. Groups of "" Indigenous guards "" in municipalities like Toribio, Corinto and Caloto have arrested several dissidents and seized and destroyed large quantities of weapons and drugs. In areas like Suarez, Buenos Aires and Santander de Quilichao, the Afro-Colombian communities have also spoken out about the use of mercury and heavy machinery for mining, which has severely polluted local rivers. Relatives of mayoral candidate Karina Garcia, who was killed in southern Colombia, cry as they embrace one of her political banners, in Suarez, Colombia, However, the FARC dissidents are not the only ones responsible for the violence in Cauca. The presence of the ELN's Jose Maria Becerra Front has also been reported towards the center and south of the department, in municipalities like El Tambo , Popayan, Sucre and Mercaderes. Attacks on civilians in areas like Argelia have been attributed to the group. Narino: Land Mired in Conflict As the country's top drug-producing region, Narino is a criminal paradise. It offers plentiful opportunities for illegal gold mining and numerous departure points for drugs along its southern border with Ecuador. Narino's strategic location has seen the armed groups operating there constantly fighting for territorial control. This has had a profound impact on local communities. Between 2016 and October 2019, at least 75 social, community, agricultural and human rights leaders were killed in Narino. In the municipalities connecting the Pacific Ocean to the interior of the department, the violence is largely due to clashes between ex-FARC Mafia groups, namely the United Guerrillas of the Pacific (Guerrillas Unidas del Pacifico -- GUP) and the Oliver Sinisterra Front (Frente Oliver Sinisterra -- FOS), while drug trafficking mafias like Los Contadores also operate in the area. While the municipality of Tumaco has reportedly seen a non-aggression pact brokered between the FOS and the GUP, there have been intense clashes between the groups throughout the rest of the region. The FOS also continues to face off with Los Contadores and, more recently, a splinter group known as the Alfonso Cano Eastern Bloc. Fights with the latter have resulted in numerous forced displacements. Meanwhile, towards the mountain ranges in the northeastern part of the department, the ELN's Manuel Vasquez Front, the FARC dissident group known as the Estiven Gonzales Front, and the Urabenos's Heroes de la Cordillera, all maintain a presence. Putumayo: Silent Violence According to the UNODC , Putumayo has the third-largest coverage of coca crops in Colombia, but this is but the tip of its criminal iceberg. Putumayo lies on the border of both Ecuador and Peru, it has access to the Caqueta and Putumayo rivers that connect the region to the eastern part of the country, and it is a hotbed for arms and drug trafficking, extortion, homicides and forced displacements. Drug trafficking continues to be the engine of war in Putumayo. Dissidents from the FARC's former 1st Front continue to operate in the municipality of Puerto Asis. In this area, as in Puerto Leguizamo, there is a war between a FARC dissident group called the Carolina Ramirez Front, and the criminal alliance known as the Sinaloa Mafia. The Sinaloa Mafia maintains a criminal alliance with La Constru, a structure that controls microtrafficking activities in the municipalities of Puerto Asis, Orito, La Hormiga, San Miguel and Valle del Guamuez. But what is most concerning to authorities and local communities is the rampant rate of murders in the municipality of Puerto Guzman, particularly in the first few weeks of 2020. On the night of January 6, hitmen on a motorcycle killed Gloria Ocampo, a recognized leader that supported crop substitution programs in the region. Her murder represented the first act of violence registered against social leaders and human rights defenders in 2020. According to civil society records , at least 27 social leaders have been murdered since the start of the new year, or almost one murder per day. Just two days after Ocampo's death, two more leaders, Gentil Hernandez and Oscar Quintero , met similar fates in the rural areas of El Mango and Cano Zabala. A week later Yordan Tovar , the head of a union for rural workers in Putumayo ( Sindicato de Trabajadores Campesinos Fronterizos del Putumayo) was also killed. The deaths of leaders like Gloria Ocampo, Gentil Hernandez, Oscar Quintero and Yordan Tovar are all included within what is being referred to as a ""death caravan"" of killers who roam around the municipality at night on motorcycles, knock on the doors of their victims and call them by name before killing them without hesitation. This is a common modus operandi seen throughout Colombia. Cocaine Colombia ELN Ex-FARC Mafia Extortion FARC peace Featured Homicides Human Rights Infographics "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Promoter of Talks with El Salvadors Gangs Loses Faith (Part 2). The following is part two of El Faro's interview with Raul Mijango. In the interview, Mijango -- a former guerrilla turned politician turned gang negotiator -- explains why he thinks the US shoulders some of the blame for the end of the truce, what role the media played in demonizing the process, and what he is going to do now that he is no longer working on forging a gang truce. Returning to the chronological story of the end of the truce. Was there a trigger that led the government to, almost overnight, rule out dialogue as an option? In the months after Sanchez Ceran came to power and until the end of the year, rumor had it that the US government was pushing to close the option for dialogue. There was a huge demand to return gang leaders to the Zacatecoluca prison's newly built , and much stricter, Sector 6. Which the United States had funded, and was why they were urging the government use it. You give credit to these theories? They came to me to say that. Then, there is the element of pressure for the Fomilenio II funds. Then came the pressure over resources that the United States was offering through the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle [Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras]. In that sense, to the extent that the US increased its offering of resources, it has forced the government to have a policy that pleases its main financier. Do you think that the US Embassy had a role in the boycott of the truce? Of course! To the extent that the United States has demonized me. This is part two of a story that originally appeared in El Faro's Sala Negra , a version of which was translated and reprinted with permission. See part one here. Spanish original here. Demonized? They denied you a visa, just like they deny thousands of Salvadorans? To me, my ex-wife I recently went to Europe and, when I was already on the plane and about to take off, some gringo officers suddenly came for me, and they began taking photos of all the documents I was carrying, including invitation letters. And when I came back, I couldn't get into Panama because the United States said so. So I had to stay waiting at an airport in Europe, and I had to change my route to land in Costa Rica, because in Panama I could not (land). But I accept it, because all my life I've been a man willing to pay the price of my decisions. And the US is prosecuting me for the truce we started. It affected the work of the FBI in the Salvadoran jails. How did it affect the work of the FBI? They had gang informants in the prisons, and some (of those informants) told the FBI to go to hell. These leaders told them that for years they had been given barely anything, and that supporting the process was more useful for the country. They stopped talking so much that there were times when FBI officials asked us to mediate so former informants would receive and talk with them. What happened then? The prisoners themselves told me that I was no jackass, and not to help the FBI because, during the the time they had spoken, for fifty minutes the FBI were asking about me, looking for ways to fuck me over. Amongst these behind the scenes maneuvers that you've told us happened during the truce, what was the role of Attorney General Luis Martinez? I think that images speak louder than words. When they dismissed David Munguia Payes as Minister of Security after the ruling of the Constitutional Chamber [that Munguia Payes, as a military officer, could not hold a position designated for civilians], the first photographs that Minister Perdomo sought to take were of him surrounded by US Ambassador Mari Carmen Aponte and Attorney General Luis Martinez. That's a message! I saved that picture. Would you say that, at least on the issue of the truce, the attorney general has been an operator of US interests? Operator I don't know, but the stance the attorney general has had against the process has been consistent with the position of the US Embassy in El Salvador. And Ricardo Perdomo? The same. You have identified Sanchez Ceren's speech in January as the final straw of the government. Would you say that the national bus strike symbolizes the same on the part of the gangs? No. As far as I know, the first day of the transport strike was a coordinated action by all the gangs, but the other days it was only supported by the Barrio 18 Revolucionaries. So I do not think the comparison works because not all the groups participated. It was a strong act but not necessarily a response to the speech by President Sanchez Ceren. Is there an action or event that represents the final blow by the gangs? I don't think so What I see is a process of escalating levels of confrontation between gangs and the State. And that has been reflected recently with increasing fighting and casualties on both sides. The truce had two components: the cessation of hostilities between gangs, and the gangs' commitments with the government. When the latter disappears, do the agreements between the gangs do as well? No. After the truce I saw them working in some ways together, coinciding at least in thought. On the ground level there will be clashes, but, at more strategic levels, yes, there is more synergy today than before the truce. When you say there are 700 structures in pure anarchy, does that mean that the leaders who handled the truce no longer have control? I would not say so. I would say that there is no longer a peace process, and as such palabreros [leaders] are not giving speeches aimed at reducing violence. The doubt was whether the current cycle of killing is due to a weakening of the leaders or, on the contrary, because they are ordering violence to be unleashed. There is more autonomy now because you no longer have the incidence level of the gangs' leadership with the territorial actors seeking to resolve problems. This no longer exists, and now no one is asking them to reduce violence. With the gangs, when there is someone in authority calling your attention and telling you not to do something, you are automatically endorsing what they do. Can you elaborate? Before, what happened was that, due to the truce, there was a higher level of centralization, which even allowed the identification of someone when they jumped the yard [committed an error]. Today, as there is more looseness and more autonomy in how to behave, there is a leadership vacuum. They do not restore order because they do not feel the need to restore order. In this anarchy that you point to, what do you make of the idea of the ""Mara 503,"" a super-structure that in theory would bring together the Barrio 18 and MS-13? How is it possible to give credence to this idea with 700 uncontrolled cliques and mutual hatreds that have become entrenched over decades? First, I must say that this is an initiative of theirs! I do not know if you've seen the videos that have been appearing on YouTube where they have been calling for the gangs to unite, which is the expression of that debate: ""Here we are facing the same challenge and it is necessary to unite."" Those videos contradict the reality that they are still killing each other. Yes, but the fact that they are having this discussion is qualitatively important because it could radically transform this whole phenomenon that continues to evolve and mutate. In what direction is it mutating? Towards a conflict that is increasingly having political overtones, which it previously did not have but does now. I do not know if they have determined in all the discussion that today they have some gang alliances. Have you not felt more class conflict? There are people in the government that hold you responsible for certain actions that get to this point: that you are a kind of political and strategic advisor to gangs. [Laughs] For the knowledge that history has allowed me to have of the gang phenomenon, I have developed a capability that I did not have, which is foretelling where things are evolving on this issue. I remember when you asked me what would happen if the truce failed what did I say? That there would be many more murders. It's simple logic! It should be viewed in a proactive sense: I came warning what will happen if things continue in the wrong direction. Why? Because unfortunately, as opposed to some, I have one advantage: I have already lived an entire conflict, and I know how things evolve. Some have said, ""What you are doing is telling the gangs what to do."" But no. It's simply that my experience allows me to predict where things are going, because they are experiences I have already lived. Why have I done this? To try to sensitize those with decision-making powers to reflect, to convince them that it is not true we are on the right track. Do you believe the government cannot win the declared low intensity war against the gangs? In war there are different concepts of victory. One of these is the Pyrrhic victory. It is when you, to obtain a result, have paid a much larger share than what you won. Of course the act of genocide can, somehow Genocide is a big word We have 700 dead people every month. But many of those are victims of the gangs themselves. But these dead are ours as a country. Genocide can only occur when a State massively eliminates its citizens, and this is not happening. For me, genocide is when an enormous amount of people die in a short period of time for the same reason. If they tell me in five years that violence levels have decreased in the country, and daily killings have dropped to an average of six or seven, but to achieve this we had to pay 30,000 or 40,000 dead Salvadorans, I would question the concept of victory. Many believe that gang members cannot be ""rehabilitated,"" and use the truce as an example proving their argument because they used this moment of peace to gain territory, to consolidate their structures That is an argument of the critics, but it is not true. That they didn't win more territory? No way! What the truce did was to expose a hidden truth. The gangs were already what they are. But during the truce, especially in rural areas, they settled in places where before they did not have a presence. It is not true. We held off recruitment, the gangs did not grow during that time. Income from crime and extortion went down a lot. We removed weaponsThat they strengthened as a political actor, that I can agree with, because throughout that period they were obviously a political actor. But in the other respects what I feel the truce did was to expose (what they were already doing). Do you think the gang member, as an active gang member, can be rehabilitated? From my experience I say yes. Did you rehabilitate many? I am rehabilitated! Many do not like it, but I lived the experience of the dismantling of the FMLN's military structures. And there were many people I could qualify as having been transformed by the war, and many of them were rehabilitated and many of them live quiet and honest lives, even in the United States itself. You insist on the analogy with the FMLN, but the thing is that the guerrillas disarmed as a military structure And that's what we wanted to do with the gangs. Was the intent of the truce to work towards dismantling the MS-13 and the two Barrio 18 factions? No, the idea was to renounce violence. I always made this distinction, because I think it is wrong to come with the idea of dismantling them as structures, dismantling their image, their way of life, because it is already a subculture. You imagine the Mara Salvatrucha would convert into what? Into an association, or what? You, the ex-guerrillas, became a political party. What will the MS-13 become? A political party as well? If they stop violence, I would ask, why not!? If the problem here is the problem of violence, that is what we must work for these groups to renounce. Suppose that's achieved There is a type of violence that goes beyond killing, which involves power relations within communities. For example, when mothers and wives of prisoners travel via bus to the prison of Ciudad Barrios, the other passengers get up to give them their seats. This relationship of distorted coexistence, this throne the gangs have ascended, how can this be dismantled? With a lot of emotional intelligence. I was at one point, between my bouts of madness, partial to the idea that you had to convert a good portion of the gang structure into a kind of auxiliary agent for community safety. Something to turn the tables: you pay them for providing security in their territories. The Italian Mafia charged to provide security, but the reality was that they charged not to fuck with you. If the State pays for gang members to be agents of peace, would it not actually be paying them to not fuck with people? And if they were under the jurisdiction of the National Police (PNC)? Convert gang members into police officers!? Into auxiliaries. I say this because the best experience we had on reintegrating ex-combatants were those who entered into the PNC. It's not the same. How is a society like ours going to process what you're proposing? If the result is positive, it is processed. The truce reduced homicides by more than half over 15 months, and the average Salvadoran hated the truce and hated you. Because the media, including El Faro, said everything was the same, that nothing had changedBut we dropped from 14 to 5 murders [per day]! They never recognized the value of the process. If you do not give the benefit of the doubt the process was just starting! It was not given the possibility to develop. Returning to the original pointDo you think the option of dialogue is impossible to revive? That's the conclusion I've come to. Why did I make the decision to no longer be involved in seeking peace alternatives over the short- or medium-term? Because I became convinced there is no national capacity, with national actors, to find a solution to this problem. I feel we have become too polarized, and that somehow we have demonized one another. And that the (security) council ended up being a puppet that only served to justify and legitimize the government's repressive action in the past year. Hence, the idea is gaining strength that it will have to be international actors who seek or help to find solutions. In practice, what does it mean that you no longer consider yourself the spokesman of the truce process? It means that this space from which I have been working in recent years is a space that is not going to be used towards that end. In fact, I'm turning over this office, and this task is no longer going to be my priority, because I am going to attend to other issues. I am going to support a peace process where there are no preconceptions impeding the pursuit of peace: the peace process in Colombia. You're already working on it? I'm working in that direction and I think it is an excellent opportunity. It seems to me what is being built there should be a model. By considering unilateral action, such as that aiming to promote the initiative to reintegrate gang members the danger of that is it being stuck in a media crisis, because who you have to take the word of is the active gang member, right? And if you're not taking him into account, or don't even want to talk to him, what are you going to do she he can decide to access the benefits of the law? It is too naive to expect that in a conflict only one side determine the rules. I will also begin to dedicate part of my efforts to a topic that I left voluntarily: politics. Today I am convinced that the country needs real political choices to change this reality. A political party? I'm thinking, I'm floating this idea with some of my friends who share my thesis, and I think that will be part of my next endeavors. We will work to build an alternative that helps resolve two things for the population: resolve the problem of violence, which we know how to do! And second, solve the problem of poverty, but not through socialism. In the entire the history of mankind, socialism has not resolved poverty for anyone. Poverty is solved by generating wealth, and that is what we will propose. *This is part two of a story that originally appeared in El Faro's Sala Negra , a version of which was translated and reprinted with permission.

"Mexico Govt Funded Pro-Police Soap Opera. A controversial soap opera that showed Mexico 's law enforcement in a flattering light was paid for by the government security agency, sparking accusations of misuse of public funds. As El Universal reported , the Secretariat of Public Security (SSP), paid roughly $10 million for the 13 episodes of ""El Equipo,"" (The Team) , which ran earlier this year. Opposition politicians have threatened an investigation , arguing that the SSP was not authorized to spend such a sum on propaganda. The Calderon administration has long expressed frustration with the popular image of Mexico as a violence-ridden wreck of a nation, and particularly with the perception of the nation's police agencies as a cesspool of corruption. TV shows depicting police officers as heroic are exceedingly rare, and the crooked or bumbling cop is much more common. SSP boss Genaro Garcia Luna, among the most powerful voices in the administration on security issues, has long been a controversial figure. His agency has previously been accused of staging fake kidnapping rescues for television cameras, and he has been the target of much of the popular frustration with Calderon's security policies. Even before the latest revelations, ""El Equipo"" was widely panned both as a political and a dramatic failure, and its ratings were significantly lower than expected. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"MS13 Trial in Spain Highlights Gangs Struggle for International Unity. The trial has begun in Spain related to the country's largest-ever operation against the MS13, revealing details of the Central American gang's failed attempt to unify factions and expand operations internationally. Spain's biggest operation against the MS13, which brought down top leadership and halted the gang's expansionist attempts in March 2014, culminated on February 20 this year with the start of a trial in the Mediterranean coastal town of Alicante. The hierarchy and functioning of the MS13 in Spain are detailed by the Attorney General's Office in a list of charges against 35 leaders and members of the gang obtained by Spanish news outlet El Pais. The MS13's ""clicas,"" or cells, which controlled various territories in Spain, coordinated with top-ranking leadership in El Salvador and were engaged in an expansionist agenda called ""Program 34"" (""Programa 34""), according to prosecutors from the special organized crime and anti-corruption unit of the Spanish Attorney General's Office. At the time of the 2014 operation that dismantled the MS13 network, the gang had formed five factions known as ""Providence"" in Madrid, ""Normandi"" in Girona, ""Dementes Locos"" and ""Demonios Locos"" in Barcelona and ""Big Crazy"" in Ibi, a city inland of Alicante that served as the gang's largest and most centrally-located faction. According to prosecutors, the MS13's expansion plan had financial and logistical support from the gang's El Salvador-based leadership and focused on opening legal businesses that could be used to launder illicit funds and provide jobs for formerly incarcerated members as well as visas for Salvadoran gang members seeking to go to Europe. The majority of the MS13's operations in Spain are thought to have been financed through the sale of marijuana and cocaine, as well as with monthly dues paid by members. The most significant charges in the case are those against Esteban Arnulfo Naviti Mejia, alias ""Darkin,"" and Pablo Antonio Naviti Mejia, alias ""Big Man,"" respectively the alleged leader and lieutenant of the Big Crazy faction in Ibi. The alleged gang members are accused of ordering the murder of a member of the rival ""Los Manosru"" gang in late 2013, as well as the murder of a witness in a case that implicated the MS13 in early 2014. Authorities intervened and prevented both attempted murders. Other charges include money laundering, attempt and conspiracy to murder, drug trafficking and illegal possession of firearms. Prosecutors initially requested a combined 230 years in prison for the accused, with Darkin facing the longest sentence of 30 years, El Mundo reported. However, on the first day of trial, prosecutors and defense lawyers reached an agreement to reduce the sentences of the accused in exchange for confessions. As a result, alleged leaders are expected to face no more than 10 years in prison and low-ranking members will likely receive sentences of 2 years or less, El Pais reported. Pending final approval of this agreement, the trial has been suspended until March 8. As Spain's biggest-ever trial against the MS13 begins, the evidence presented is already revealing strong similarities between the gang's failed expansion and unification attempts in Spain and those the gang undertook in the United States. As InSight Crime detailed in a 2016 investigative series , at the same time that the MS13's leadership in El Salvador began coordinating with cells in Spain to create the ""Program 34"" expansion plan, a similar plan known as ""The Project"" was already underway in the United States. In both cases, MS13 leaders in Salvadoran prisons attempted to unify disparate, localized cells in each country and increase revenue streams by ramping up drug sales and the collection of dues from members. However, the MS13's apparent attempts to increase communication and coordination of drug trafficking activities between top leadership in El Salvador and cells in other countries have repeatedly failed for various reasons. The MS13's loose hierarchy and decentralized cliques have complicated attempts at unification, at the same time that the gang's violence and notoriety have drawn law enforcement attention to their operations. In Spain and the United States, the MS13's plans to consolidate were promptly brought down by investigations that centered on phone taps of the conversations between leaders of local cliques and imprisoned leaders in El Salvador."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"PCC Suspected in Journalists Killing on Brazil-Paraguay Border. Armed men shot and killed a Brazilian journalist who covered police and drug trafficking along the Brazil-Paraguay border, underscoring the precarious situation for reporters in a lawless region dominated by organized crime groups and rampant corruption. Lourenco ""Leo"" Veras -- who had assisted InSight Crime's ongoing investigations in the area, as well as other foreign media -- was killed the night of February 12 at his home in the border town of Pedro Juan Caballero in Paraguay's eastern Amambay department, ABC Color reported. The three masked gunmen -- who entered Veras' home as he ate dinner with his family on their patio -- shot him 12 times, primarily in the back and then a final shot to his head. Veras was taken to a private hospital but was pronounced dead a short time later, according to ABC Color. On February 24, prosecutors in Paraguay said 10 suspects in the killing of Veras had been arrested -- nine on criminal conspiracy and weapons charges, according to an official news release by the Attorney General's Office. The 10 suspects included six Paraguayans, three Brazilians and one Bolivian. Among those arrested was Cyntia Raquel Pereira, who is suspected of belonging to the First Capital Command ( Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC ), Prosecutor Marcelo Pecci said. He said Pereira had been sentenced previously to 10 years in prison in Brazil for drug trafficking and other crimes related to the PCC, a violent Brazilian gang that has gained a foothold in Paraguay. A Jeep Renegade -- seen on surveillance cameras on the night of the murder moving about downtown Pedro Juan Caballero -- was later driven to her home, Brazilian news outlet Estadao reported. The Jeep was used by the gunmen, prosecutors said. The vehicle and several weapons -- including four Glock pistols, two revolvers, and a shotgun -- were seized by authorities during the arrests. Prosecutors also said they have identified the gun used to kill Veras. Ballistic tests have shown that it had been used in other crimes, said Pecci , who is part of a special investigative unit dedicated to the case. Veras' family members, who witnessed the killing, have also provided prosecutors with descriptions of the assailants. It's not yet clear why Veras was targeted, but the gunmen reportedly bound his mouth after he was shot, as if to send a message about the journalist's work. A s the director of Pora News and a freelance reporter for many media organizations in the border region for years, he had received past threats for covering the police and organized crime groups operating in Pedro Juan Caballero and Ponta Pora, which sits just across the border in Brazil's Mato Grosso do Sul state. ""We urge authorities to conduct a thorough investigation to find the murderers [and provide] immediate protection for colleagues in the area against the prevailing insecurity and lack of guarantees for reporters,"" the Paraguayan Journalists Forum (Foro de Periodistas Paraguayos -- FOPEP) said in a press release, according to ABC Color. Cases of murdered journalists are rare in Paraguay, but Veras' killing brings the total number of reporters killed to 18 since the country's transition to democracy in 1992, La Nacion reported. What's more, Reporters Without Borders, which tracts the killing of journalists worldwide, has raised concerns about a ""worrying lack of progress"" in ensuring the protection of journalists operating in the country. The organization identified the border region with Brazil as being particularly dangerous for reporters who often come under attack from criminal organizations that benefit from a ""climate of near-total impunity."" Veras is not the only journalist along the Brazil-Paraguay border to be targeted. Candido Figueredo, a correspondent for ABC Color, told InSight Crime on a recent field trip about the constant threats he faces from organized crime groups. Bullet holes from past attempts on his life marked the walls and doors of his home, which he now only leaves accompanied by private security. ""There is a lot of fear, reporters are taking [Veras' death] as if it was a wake-up call for everyone,"" Blanca Lopez of Paraguay's C9N News told InSight Crime. Veras' murder follows the dramatic January 2020 escape of 76 PCC gang members from the Pedro Juan Caballero Regional Penitentiary. When authorities began recapturing some of those who had escaped weeks later, criminal groups apparently ordered local journalists to stop covering the case, Lopez said. Though its roots are in Brazil, the PCC has spread into Paraguay, especially in the border region. PCC gang members have also wreaked havoc in Paraguay's prisons, using extreme violence in its clashes with other gangs and using the jails to recruit new members."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Could Guatemala Citys Smart Bus System Cut Extortion?Guatemala City's replacement of its old buses with a more secure system where drivers do not handle cash could help cut down on extortion of bus companies and reduce violence on public transportation. The murder of three bus company employees in Guatemala City on July 25 is just the latest example of the dangers faced by public transit workers and passengers in Guatemala. Extortion of bus drivers and companies by criminal gangs in Guatemala has become so pervasive and violent that a 2011 InSight Crime investigation concluded that driving a bus in Guatemala may be the most dangerous job in the world. According to the Human Rights Ombudsman's 2011 Annual Report , 1,368 people were murdered on Guatemala's public transportation in the past six years: 780 drivers, 255 bus assistants (""brochas""), and 249 passengers. Some 59 percent of violence on buses took place in the country's capital. The government pays around $35 million in subsidies each year to bus companies in order to make transportation affordable for most Guatemalans, but there is little oversight of bus safety, rates, or routes. The old buses, which are often reused US school buses , run on a cash payment system that makes extortion easy. Drivers and passengers face violence when gang members board buses to collect payment or punish those who refuse to pay. The extortion schemes are typically run by gangs such as Mara Salvatrucha ( MS-13 ) and Barrio 18 , whose leaders oversee the operations from within Guatemala's prisons. Government investigators say that the gangs charge bus companies around 200 quetzales ($25) per week per bus, adding up to around Q40,000 ($5,000) per week per bus route. This system provides a major source of revenue for gangs, who collected an estimated $1.5 million from bus companies in 2010. The bus companies themselves are sometimes involved in the extortion of their rivals; Guatemala's Attorney General's Office recently reported that some sell personal information about employees of their competitors to gangs, making it easier for the criminals to threaten them. The high level of gang penetration, corruption in the bus companies, and the weakness of Guatemala's institutions make combating violence and extortion on public transport extremely challenging. The expansion of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Guatemala City, however, could prove to be an effective strategy for reducing extortion of bus companies and violence against drivers and passengers. First used in Curitiba, Brazil in 1974, BRT systems employ dedicated bus lanes to channel high-capacity buses along a series of fixed stations. BRT's modern appearance and low cost have made it very appealing for governments in Latin America. The first line of Guatemala's BRT system, the Transmetro, opened in 2007. A second was added in 2009, and as of June of this year the Transmetro was serving an average of 268,000 passengers each day. Designed to appeal not only to the 68 percent of residents who typically use public transport but also to car owners looking to cut the cost and length of their commute, the Transmetro currently consists of two lines and 32 stations, with more planned for the future. It is run by the Guatemala City municipal government and receives support from the United Nations Development Program. The kinds of extortion schemes run by gangs on traditional buses are impossible on Transmetro due to its digital payment system. Most traditional buses in Guatemala lack cash collection machines. Instead, an assistant, known as a ""brocha,"" or the bus driver himself collects the fare directly from passengers. On Transmetro, however, passengers either insert Q1 ($0.13) into electronic fareboxes at the entrance of the stations or use prepaid cards to pay their fare. This payment system cuts out the drivers from the process of fare collection and gets rid of the bus assistants, who are sometimes affiliated with gangs. The centralized structure and government oversight of the Transmetro system make it much safer. Weapons are banned on board the buses, and the stations are equipped with closed circuit cameras and patrolled by municipal police. The fixed entry and exit points, coupled with the presence of the municipal police, make it difficult for assailants to escape after committing a crime. Some sources say that as of 2011 there had been no murders, armed robberies, or other violent incidents reported on the Transmetro, although this has not been confirmed by the authorities. The Transmetro only serves a portion of Guatemala City's bus drivers and passengers today, but it is a step in the right direction. Working for Transmetro, rather than for a private bus company, will not prevent drivers from being extorted at home in neighborhoods controlled by gangs, but it does allow them to go to work each day with less fear of violence."	0	0	1	1	1	0	0
"Bolivia Presidents Ex-Girlfriend Accused of Leading Mafia. Government officials in Bolivia have accused the former mistress of President Evo Morales of corruption, extortion and racketeering, as Bolivia becomes the latest country to see cracks in the impunity enjoyed by Latin American elites. Minister for the Presidency Juan Ramon Quintana presented evidence in a May 13 press conference against a corruption racket involving Gabriela Zapata Montano, La Razon reported. Quintana also denounced Cristina Choque, the former director of the Social Unit (Unidad de Gestion Social) within the Office of the Presidency, for having led the operation with Zapata. Ricardo Alegria Sequeiros, a former member of the Bolivian Senate, has also been implicated in the scheme, which is being described as a ""state mafia."" While he did not provide much detail on how the network functioned, Quintana said that he will be turning over the evidence that his office has uncovered to prosecutors in the Public Ministry. Zapata's judicial problems began on February 26 when she was arrested on suspicion of illegal enrichment, influence trafficking, and money laundering. Zapata is a former commercial manager for the international firm China CAMC, which has received some $500 million in state contracts in recent years. She was reportedly in a relationship with Morales between 2005 and 2007 and the pair had a child together. Their relationship only became public in early 2016. With government ministers now adding to the evidence against Zapata, it appears her case is set to become the latest corruption scandal to reach political elites in Latin America. The biggest of these scandals was seen in Guatemala, where the president and vice president were ousted last year and are currently awaiting trial on charges they were operating a customs fraud ring. The current first lady of Peru Nadine Heredia has also been dogged by corruption allegations , while the evolving ""Ruta K"" public works corruption scandal in Argentina threatens to tarnish the legacy of deceased former President Nestor Kirchner as well as the reputation of his wife and successor as president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. This raft of investigations reaching the highest offices of political power suggest the region's corrupt elites may not be as secure as they have been in the past. However, corruption in Latin America is deeply rooted and there remains far to go if the region is to truly break free of its grip."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Colombias El Tandil - Where Childrens Education Depends on the Coca Leaf. A recent report on child labor in the municipality of Tumaco has shed light on why children and young people around Colombia find themselves cornered into participating in coca cultivation and production. On October 13, El Espectador published a special report on precarious conditions at ten schools in the countryside around the village of El Tandil, Tumaco, in the southwestern department of Narino. This has led to many children dropping out of school and going to work in the cultivation of coca crops. According to the report, the schools are in such a poor condition that local residents have to pay out of their own pockets to restore the schools and pay the teachers to continue working there. However, the money being used to try and keep the schools open comes from the main economy in the area -- coca cultivation. Despite community efforts, school dropout rates continue to rise, the article says. In 2016, 650 students attended the school. By 2019, the number of students had fallen to 288. According to interviews conducted by the newspaper, school drop-outs usually end up harvesting coca leaves at plantations owned by relatives or neighbors. Some locals also added that they preferred not to send their children to school, since violence in the area meant they could not guarantee their safety. What is happening in El Tandil reflects a national problem. Thousands of children around the country have become involved with drug trafficking operations run by criminal groups, due to state abandonment, a lack of institutional support, and the coca boom. Child labor within the drug production chain, such as that seen in Narino, also occurs in many other departments, particularly Cauca , Antioquia and Norte de Santander , where coca production thrives. While there are no exact child labor statistics regarding this particular issue, at least six percent of all children under the age of 17 work in Colombia, according to the country's National Administrative Department of Statistics (Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica - DANE). Remote areas like El Tandil suffer from a mixture of problems. Coca production thrives, in part because there are very few ways to access the community, driving up transportation costs and making it difficult to make the cultivation of legal agricultural products financially viable. Due to the lack of state presence, institutional support for children in these regions is also scant. This stems not only from a lack of educational resources, infrastructure and personnel, but also from an absence of security. On top of this, Colombia produced record levels of cocaine in 2017 and 2018, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). And thousands of communities see coca cultivation as their only opportunity for economic survival. InSight Crime fieldwork in Vichada and Norte de Santander has also confirmed that, for a number of these minors, gathering coca is only a first step. All too often, lured by the promise of a salary, food and lodging, or access to weapons, many then become closely associated with criminal groups and prone to physical, sexual and psychological abuse.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombias Green War Reigniting with Death of Emerald Baron?The death of one of Colombia's most important emerald barons marks the end of an era of relative peace and could usher in another ""Green War"" as rival clans fight for control of the most productive emerald mines. On September 11, Luis Murcia Chaparro, known as ""El Pekines,"" was killed on a farm in the province of Cundinamarca, reported El Espectador. The emerald baron was reportedly sleeping when armed men arrived at the farm on a motorcycle. The attackers pursued him as he tried to flee and shot him six times. According to El Tiempo , Murcia had reportedly traveled to the farm to check on his fighting roosters and had minimal protection at the time of the attack, despite the fact that Murcia and 14 other emerald businessmen had reported an assassination plot against them earlier in the week. The businessmen had told the Attorney General's Office they had been threatened, and had called on the government and the Catholic Church to intervene and prevent the outbreak of another conflict among rival emerald barons. Starting in the 1960's, several families -- with the help of private armies -- fought a bloody conflict for control of Colombia's emerald region, centered north of capital city Bogota in Boyaca province. Thousands were killed before the Church helped negotiate a peace agreement between them in 1990. Murcia was instrumental in negotiating this accord , which ended the so-called ""Green War."" Murcia's passing marks the end of the old guard that still defended the 1990 peace agreement, and his death has sparked speculation that the ""Green War"" may be reigniting. He is the sixth person in the emerald industry to have been killed since the ""Emerald Czar,"" Victor Carranza, died in April 2013. Carranza, an infamous figure in Colombia's underworld , was once the most powerful man in the emerald trade and was also instrumental in negotiating the 1990 truce. Now, the remaining emerald businessmen appear to be grouping themselves into two rival bands: one led by Carranza's former closest associates, and the other led by Pedro Rincon Castillo, known as ""Pedro Orejas."" Rincon was the victim of an attack in November 2013 , for which he blamed Murcia. Murcia denied any involvement in the incident, but told El Tiempo he feared for his safety because Rincon wanted to kill him. The situation in the region is complicated by the possible involvement of Colombia's most powerful criminal group, the Urabenos. Murcia's brother was arrested earlier this year , accused of trying to forge an alliance with the Urabenos to defeat Rincon and take control of the emerald region. According to Colombia's investigative police, a former paramilitary leader and current Urabenos operative named Yonny Cano Linares was going to lead the Urabenos' offensive in the region so the criminal group could take control of drug trafficking routes to the Eastern Plains region, in addition to emerald mining.

"Mining Massacre Signals ELN Expansion Into Venezuela. The recent massacre of seven people in one of Venezuela's mining regions may confirm that the Colombia guerrilla group ELN is expanding its criminal activities into the south of Venezuela, encroaching on the gold mining territory of local mafias. On October 14 on the border with Guyana, alleged members of the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) are believed to have ambushed a group of miners in the town of El Bochinche, located in the municipality of Sifontes in Bolivar state. The first reports came from six miners who survived the attack. Only later did Venezuelan armed forces discover seven bodies near the mine, according to media outlet El Pitazo. All of the victims whose bodies were recovered had been shot execution-style. Local residents reported 16 disappearances. So far, the Venezuelan government has not offered an official version of events. There have been repeated massacres in the mining areas of Bolivar state, mostly due to rivalries between criminal gangs called either ""syndicates"" (sindicatos) or ""pranatos,"" the latter of which is a type of mafia that originated in Venezuela's prison system and whose leaders are called "" pranes ."" Mining pranatos have successfully established themselves and now set the standard for all illegal businesses thriving on the unchecked pilfering of Venezuela's mineral deposits. What is different about this incident is the alleged role of the ELN. Bolivar's representative in the National Assembly, Americo De Grazia , was one of the first to confirm it. ""The indigenous and mining communities have been reporting the presence of the ELN in El Bochinche to us since November 2017,"" he told InSight Crime. Colombian President Ivan Duque has also mentioned the likelihood of the ELN transferring some of its criminal enclaves to Venezuelan territory -- with the "" support "" of Nicolas Maduro's government. This week, he shut down any possibility of dialogue with the guerrilla group if their criminal activities continue. While it is believed that the ELN has expanded into Venezuelan territory, it remains difficult to determine just how well established it is. But its alleged presence more than 1,500 kilometers from the Colombian border could mean it is poised to enter into another war -- this time for gold -- and its first battles would be with the criminal gangs operating along the borders with Guyana and Brazil. The ELN could be making headway into Venezuela in search of new opportunities to expand its criminal economies. Congressman De Grazia explained that approximately 100 armed and uniformed members of the ELN have allegedly settled in El Bochinche, where the latest attack on miners took place. ""They seized the Hermanos Hernandez logging operation and installed a camp there,"" he added. De Grazia also alleged that the ELN and government authorities in the mining areas have formed an alliance as part of a corruption network that reaches all the way to Caracas and involves top military and civil officials. ""The government of President Nicolas Maduro is very satisfied with the work the ELN has done. They appreciate that they've displaced the pranatos in controlling illegal mining. The government thinks of the ELN as serious people with whom they can negotiate. That's why they're acting with impunity. They moved towards Cedeno [a municipality in Bolivar state] and took over the coltan and diamond mining. Now for about a year we've seen them fighting over the gold mines at the other end of the country, on the border with Guyana,"" the politician told InSight Crime. Javier Tarazona, director of non-governmental organization Fundaredes, has been following the ELN's expansion into Venezuela. He agrees with De Grazia regarding the potential shift in ""criminal governments"" in the country's mining regions. ""The government has lost control of the mining pranato and is appealing to the greater fire power that the ELN may have. It's operating as an armed branch of the ruling party to keep the illegal mining profits coming in,"" Tarazone said. Illegal mining is a criminal economy that the ELN has already been exploiting in Colombian territory. The current situation in Venezuela -- in part because authorities seem to lack the will to intervene -- makes it easier for the group to fill its coffers and strengthen its criminal structures with the resources it gets from gold mining. Add to this the pressure the Colombian government is putting on the guerrilla group by ending the ceasefire, and seeking refuge on the other side of the border may seem like an attractive option for the ELN now more than ever."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Six Ways a DTO Used a Miami Police Lieutenant. Former Miami Police Lieutenant Ralph Mata's involvement in drug and arms trafficking, as well as money laundering, shows just how important a high-ranking policeman can be to a drug trafficking organization. Mata -- who once referred to himself in a text message to his criminal bosses as the ""The Milk Man"" -- pleaded guilty to three federal charges on March 31 in New Jersey, according to the Miami Herald , including money laundering and narcotics conspiracy, and faces between 10 years and life prison. (See indictment in pdf ) Mata led a startling double life. With the police he held numerous important, sensitive posts, including in the internal affairs division. But he was also part of an international drug trafficking organization (DTO), according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) formal complaint ( pdf ), which moved cocaine from Ecuador and the Dominican Republic to the US in shipping containers carrying items like bananas. Mata appeared to be intimately involved in the DTO's operations. The FBI's formal complaint states that he assisted in the planning and partial payment for the assassination of rivals from another criminal organization. The plot involved dressing as police to conduct the hit, but the leaders decided not to go forward, the complaint said. Mata also used his police connections and credentials to traffic weapons, the complaint stated. In 2012, he used his badge to purchase a Sig Sauer rifle and a Sig Sauer pistol. Both were later found in the Dominican Republic during arrests of DTO members. He later used his access to investigate the seizure of $419,000 in cash in narcotics proceeds in Bergen County, New Jersey, at a DTO safe house. At least part of the cash, he found out using his sources, had been stolen by a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent, the complaint said. The complaint did not say if the DEA agent was investigated. The complaint also detailed how Mata could use information obtained via his job to determine the best times to move drugs into Miami's port (while the Coast Guard trained) and offered to move drugs from Florida to New Jersey with a police K-9 because, as he told the DTO leaders, should he be stopped, he could explain that he was going to a K-9 training. In addition, Mata traveled alone or with other members of the organization to pick up and move drug proceeds, including traveling to the Dominican Republic from New York City on at least one occasion, the complaint said. And when the police seized 160 kilograms of cocaine and arrested several members of the group, Mata used his police contacts to find out the state and seriousness of the case. The case, while seemingly small in terms of money and cocaine, illustrates just how many ways a criminal group can use a high-level police contact. In the complaint alone, there were six different jobs Mata did for the group, which included everything from custodial services to muscle jobs, intelligence gathering to internal investigations. The wide range of chores Mata performed is not uncommon and show why, when DTOs set up shop from Buenos Aires to New Jersey, the first job they have is to co-opt the police."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"The Politics Behind the Hunt for Paraguays Guerrillas. Paraguay security forces appear to be keeping up the pressure against the small and elusive EPP guerrilla group. The organization does not appear to pose a serious national threat, suggesting that the campaign may have as much to do with politics as with security. The Paraguayan People's Army (Ejercito del Pueblo Paraguayo - EPP) began raising concerns earlier this year with a string of bomb attacks in the country's rural north. Two small-scale bombs were detonated in the country's capital, Asuncion, in early January, followed by a more serious attack -- which injured at least four people -- in Horqueta, Concepcion. The government has concentrated their offensive against the EPP in this department, and at least 230 members of the police special forces have been deployed there since circa 2009, when the group kidnapped a prominent local rancher. Security forces have since kept up the campaign against the EPP, arresting five alleged members of their support network in May , and more recently hailing the discovery of a supposed encampment in rural Concepcion. The most serious alleged guerrilla attack since January reportedly targeted one of their own former members: the pregnant wife of a jailed EPP operative who was arrested last year in connection with a kidnapping case. She was found dead on June 17, allegedly shot by the EPP because she became involved with another man while her husband was in prison, according to national newspaper ABC. It may be that the EPP is not even involved in the murder, as the group's activities more typically include bomb attacks or kidnappings. The group is believed to be a dissident faction of a Marxist political party, the Free Homeland Party (Partido Patria Libre - PPL). With no more than an estimated 100 members, the group has shown a surprising capacity to carry out well-planned operations, such as the 2009 kidnapping of rancher Fidel Zavela, and the killing of four people by sniper fire in April 2010. This prompted President Fernando Lugo to launch a security surge in northern Paraguay, intended to debilitate the EPP. The president pushed a proposal through Congress which gave security forces the power to make arrests without warrants during a 30-day ""state of exception."" A reported surge of 1,000 troops and police were deployed to Concepcion and four other departments. Results, however, were few. No top EPP commanders were captured during the surge. Meanwhile, January's bomb attacks demonstrated that the group retains some offensive capacity, as well as plenty of ability to grab media headlines. Lugo's emphasis on hunting down the EPP is curious in light of the fact that the small guerrilla group may not even be the country's most pressing security concern. Arguably, a problem with far greater implications for international security is the well-established contraband and drug trade at the Tri-Border Area, where Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina meet. Here, the country reported its largest ever cocaine seizure in early June. The area is a hub for smuggling and money laundering, and reportedly harbors other global criminal and terrorist groups, including Hezbollah. Paraguay's border with Brazil is another weak point , where Brazilian gangs like the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando del Capital - PCC) and Red Command (Comando Vermelho) are believed to run lucrative marijuana-trafficking networks. The PCC's presence in northern Paraguay was strong enough to spring six gang members from a Paraguay jail in May. If Lugo has prioritized the persecution of the EPP over other security concerns, it may be a decision driven by politics. Taking a ""mano dura,"" or iron fist, approach against the EPP is an easy way for the president to show he isn't soft on crime. More importantly, it distances himself even further from the country's radical left. Lugo is the first leftist president to be elected to office in decades, breaking 61 years of rule of the conservative Colorado Party. Critics have tried to associate Lugo with some of the left's more extreme elements. Photos printed last year showing Lugo in the same frame as an alleged EPP operative didn't help things. The EPP's ability to carry out well-planned, long-term kidnappings (like that of Zavela), as well their reliance on terrorist attacks like bombs, makes them a genuine cause for concern in Paraguay. At the same time, the government's disproportionately hardline reaction against the guerrillas must be understood in terms of Paraguay's current political transformation. By declaring a ""state of exception"" against the EPP in 2010 -- and by loudly proclaiming the discovery of each small, primitive guerrilla camp -- the government perhaps is granting more status to the EPP than it deserves. But Paraguay's first leftist president may have good reason to be sensitive about alleged Marxist guerrillas carrying out attacks. Granting the EPP such status, even at the expense of tackling other security concerns at the border region, may be necessary for Lugo's political survival. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Chile Dismantles First Arms Trafficking Ring Importing US Weapons. Authorities in Chile say they have uncovered the first international arms trafficking network importing guns from the United States to be resold in the South American nation, illustrating how crime groups across Latin America have taken advantage of lax US gun laws to supply the region with illicit weapons. The organized crime division of Chile's investigative police dismantled an arms trafficking ring linked to three shipments containing 18 firearms, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunitions, other firearm accessories and eight luxury vehicles that were seized by police over the course of a four-month investigation dubbed ""Operation Houston,"" La Tercera reported. According to a press release from Chile's customs agency, the investigation began in January 2018 after authorities intercepted a shipment of four automatic pistols at the international airport in the capital Santiago. Authorities have linked the shipments to a criminal group known as ""Los Pachucos"" operating in the city of Maipu in central Chile just southwest of Santiago, according to La Tercera. The group has been involved in petty crimes in the area since the 1990s. Beginning in 2015, Los Pachucos allegedly started to expand their criminal portfolio. The group's leader, Mauricio Pavez Becerra, moved to Houston to capitalize on lax US gun laws and start shipping weapons back to Chile hidden in electronic devices like DVD players and radios, according to La Tercera. Los Pachucos also allegedly partnered with a Chilean car importer named Fernando Cabrera who operated in the northern port city of Arica to introduce the weapons into the country. According to La Tercera, Pavez Becerra would transfer the weapons from Houston to Miami where a middleman by the name of Jean Pierre Allende Saez would hide them in the interiors of cars and trucks that were to be imported to Chile in shipping containers by boat. Pavez Becerra allegedly acquired the guns for $500 in Texas. Los Pachucos would then resell the weapons at a marked up price of 1.5 million Chilean pesos (around $2,400) to local criminals operating in Santiago and Valparaiso along Chile's Pacific coast, according to La Tercera. Authorities have charged 12 individuals with arms trafficking, illicit association and money laundering, among other charges, according to an Interior Ministry press release. However, the middleman between Pavez Becerra and the Chilean car importer remains a fugitive in the United States, according to La Tercera. Although Chilean authorities said this is the first time they have discovered an arms trafficking ring with a connection to the United States, the exploitation of loose US gun laws and the methods used by the trafficking network are actually quite common across the region. Trafficking US firearms to Latin America disguised in shipments of other goods with metal components is a method frequently used by traffickers. And other smugglers have previously used the busy port city of Miami, which sees huge trade flows with Latin America. In February 2017, for example, US authorities dismantled a trafficking ring that was shipping firearms and ammunition disguised in packages of empty car batteries from Miami to Maracaibo, Venezuela. A Brazilian trafficking network uncovered last year also shipped guns through Miami."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Three Congressmen Linked to Drug Traffickers in Paraguay. Three Congressmen in Paraguay have been accused of links to Brazilian drug trafficking groups, as more politicians get drawn into what the local media is calling the ""narcopolitics scandal."" The legislators Freddy D'Ecclesiis and Marcial Lezcano have ties to the Congressional alternate Carlos Ruben Sanchez, who is considered the right-hand man to the notorious Brazilian drug trafficker Luiz Carlos da Rocha, alias ""Cabeca Branca,"" reported ABC Color. D'Ecclesiis and Lezcano reportedly defended Sanchez after he was arrested on charges of money laundering and also met with him in Tacumbu prison. D'Ecclesiis also allegedly kept in close contact with Mario Gimenez Noguera, the leader of a Paraguayan drug trafficking clan. Lezcano's younger brother was released in suspicious circumstances after his arrest for trafficking liquid cocaine in 2013. Meanwhile, ABC Color recently published text messages exchanged between Congressman Bernardo Villalba and Carlos Antonio Caballero, alias ""Capilo"", an alleged Paraguayan supplier of marijuana to the powerful Brazilian prison gang First Capital Command (PCC). Villalba reportedly asked Capilo to finance his political campaign and also mentioned bribing a judge on behalf of the alleged drug trafficker. The revelation of two additional Congressmen with ties to drug trafficking groups suggests Paraguay's narco-politics scandal will continue to snowball, as InSight Crime previously predicted. The October assassination of the ABC journalist Pablo Medina -- for which a local mayor is the primary suspect -- initiated the recent focus on links between politicians and drug traffickers in Paraguay. Medina had received several threats prior to his death for reporting on the country's drug trade. Shortly after Medina's death, Paraguay's anti-drug czar Luis Rojas publicly denounced the undue influence of drug traffickers in the country's political circles, judicial system, and the press. Two former legislators, Jose Lopez Chavez and Magdaleno Silva, have also recently been implicated in maintaining ties to drug traffickers, according to documents released by ABC Color. Despite the numerous reports linking politicians to criminal actors, it appears no criminal charges have as yet been brought against any of the implicated public officials. The fact all three current Congressmen are linked to Brazilian drug trafficking groups is indication of that country's organized crime influence in Paraguay. Official corruption has enabled Brazilian crime groups to take a hold in eastern Paraguay, with ""Cabeca Branca's"" drug trafficking network stretching as far back as the mid-1990s. Paraguay is attractive to drug trafficking groups due to its prolific marijuana production as well as its role as a transit point for cocaine heading to Brazil, the region's largest consumer market."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
400 Arrests This Year as Honduras Cracks Down on Extortion. Data released by a special Honduras police unit formed to combat extortion indicates the country is making progress against an illegal industry responsible for many deaths and massive economic losses. The National Anti-Extortion Force (Fuerza Nacional Antiextorsion - FNA) said it had arrested 404 people for extorting of public and private transportation organizations, a common target of gangs throughout Central America, La Tribuna reported. The paper said adult males made up 77.5 percent of those captured while minors -- who are often used to deliver threats and payment instructions -- accounted for 11.4 percent and another 11.1 percent of those taken into custody were adult females. The FNA reportedly has received a total of 600 complaints this year. Of that number, 221 cases went to court, resulting in 168 convictions. That is a 76 percent conviction rate. An FNA spokesman quoted by La Tribuna said the majority of those affected by extortion are public transportation groups or private providers of transportation. These victims are often intimidated and threatened with death by various criminal bands, including gang members from MS-13 and Barrio 18. Extortion is a huge issue that continues to plague the Central American countries of the Northern Triangle -- El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Just this week a government investigator in Guatemala was murdered near a market where vendors had begun to publicly protest extortion. While extortion continues to plague the region, it appears that the Honduran Government is now taking a tougher approach to the crime , recognizing the political and economic toll it is having on the population of the Central American nation. The Honduras' National Human Rights Commission (Conadeh) has attributed the deaths of hundreds of transportation workers to the work of extortionists groups. In addition to this deadly toll, the FNA estimates that extortion costs Honduras $200 million per year. For a country whose gross domestic product is only about $20 billion, that figure represents about 1 percent of the total economy. These figures are not small amounts for a nation beset by poverty and also plagued by corruption. One former social security director there has been accused of embezzling $300 million. While criminal groups such as gangs are often behind extortion rackets, the FNA has previously said that soldiers, police, government officials and even the transportation companies themselves are active participants in extortion rackets. But it appears that the FNA is making inroads in countering the malicious practice which is taking a devastating toll on common Honduran citizens.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Zetas Narco-Tank Seized in North Mexico. Mexico's police seized an armored tank belonging to drug trafficking organization the Zetas in the border state of Tamaulipas. The tank is built out of metal, and El Blog del Narco said it showed technological developments compared to similar vehicles that have previously been seized. It can travel at up to 110 kilometers per hour, and carry 12 passengers, with two openings from which gunmen can deploy rocket launchers, grenades and rifles. The vehicle reportedly had a space at the back from which passengers could release nails or oil onto the road to thwart pursuers. The body of the tank was not damaged by a gunfight with the authorities, but its tires were punctured, as it lacked proper wheel guards. Police made the find in Ciudad Mier, a small town which hit the headlines in November last year when the majority of its residents left, fleeing a turf war between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. This is the latest in a series of seizures of increasingly sophisticated armored vehicles owned by Mexico's drug trafficking organizations. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Bolivia Assassinations Underscore Role of Santa Cruz in Drug Trade. Recent targeted assassinations coupled with the capture of the alleged Colombian leader of a drug trafficking group linked to payback killings in Santa Cruz, Bolivia highlight the eastern province's growing status as a transnational crime hub. Over the last two weeks at least five people have been murdered in Santa Cruz in what appear to be revenge killings, which the province's Governor Ruben Costas has attributed to drug trafficking groups, reported La Razon. He also said Santa Cruz was becoming increasingly violent because of the illegal drug trade. On July 23, Bolivian law enforcement agents captured Alicia Lorena Vargas Munoz, alias ""La Mona,"" a Colombian national who allegedly ran a drug trafficking group with international ties and who has been implicated in Santa Cruz murders, reported El Deber. Vargas was arrested along with four other individuals. According to police investigations, one victim -- killed in April 2013 -- was a Peruvian national who had fled to Bolivia after failing to pay a drug trafficking debt. Vargas allegedly tracked him down in Santa Cruz and sent hit men to kill him. Bolivia is both a cocaine producer and a transit nation for Peruvian cocaine. Most of the cocaine coming from Bolivia is sold to domestic markets in Brazil and Argentina or shipped from those countries on to Europe. An estimated 80 percent of Bolivian cocaine is smuggled into Brazil, much of it passing through the Santa Cruz province, which shares a border with Brazil and has become a major drug trafficking hub. As a result -- as the capture of Vargas highlights -- a number of international drug trafficking groups have begun operations or have emissaries in the province, including the Brazilian prison gangs the First Capital Command (PCC) and the Red Command. In 2011, a Colombian intelligence officer stated that as many as 3,000 Colombian drug traffickers operated in Santa Cruz. In some cases, the foreign criminals setting up shop in Santa Cruz are fleeing prosecution in their home countries and apparently see the Bolivian province as a relative safe haven. The most recent killings could be a sign of rising violence connected to the drug trade as the presence of foreign crime groups continues to grow. In comparison, just three drug-related shootings reportedly took place in June of 2011."	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"98% of Mexicos 2012 Murder Cases Unsolved. According to Mexico's national statistics institute, just 1.8 percent of the homicides registered in 2012 have resulted in a sentence, a grim reminder of the challenges that Mexico faces in speeding up its judicial process. As Animal Politico reports , sentences have been issued in just 523 of the 27,500 homicides registered in Mexico last year, according to statistic agency INEGI. The numbers show that in two states, Hidalgo and Tlaxcala, no homicide cases from last year resulted in sentences. Things aren't much better in some of Mexico's most crime-racked regions, including San Luis Potosi (where 99.6 percent of homicide cases have not been resolved), Sinaloa (99.2 percent), Chihuahua (98.3 percent), Tamaulipas (97.5 percent), and Michoacan (96.8 percent). The state with the highest rate of sentencing is the Federal District, although 81.4 percent of cases here remain unsolved. As noted by Animal Politico, local governments have misleadingly registered some murder cases as ""processed"" -- meaning that a suspect was presented before a judge -- even though they ultimately did not result in a sentence. In Hidalgo, for example, 106 people were reported as having been ""processed,"" although none of the cases saw convictions. The challenges facing Mexico's judiciary are well noted. It is not just a matter of stalled homicide cases -- last year, the Attorney General's Office reported that only 30 percent of those detained on drug trafficking charges between 2007 and 2011 were convicted. The United Nations has said that 90 percent of those arrested during the first five years of President Felipe Calderon's administration eventually went free. Improving the efficiency of the judiciary remains one of the major challenges facing President Enrique Pena Nieto, as it was under Calderon, who oversaw a series of dramatic reforms in 2008. One issue is the number of public servants who still need to trained in Mexico's new accusatorial trial system. The US is helping with this , but the process is moving slowly."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"GameChangers 2016: Gang Evolution in Central Americas Southern Gateway. When it comes to Central America, all eyes are usually on the Northern Triangle. But 2016 saw local organized crime in Costa Rica and Panama -- traditionally oases of calm in the region -- enter unprecedented territory. In Costa Rica, the evolution of domestic criminal groups has led to a surge in violence, while criminal structures in Panama appear to be growing increasingly sophisticated. This trend is set to continue into 2017 as state institutions struggle to cope with the burgeoning threat, while drug trafficking through the region grows. The year 2016 offered yet more evidence that local organized crime in the Central American countries of Costa Rica and Panama -- nations not typically thought to harbor home-grown transnational crime syndicates -- is becoming more complex. In Panama, local gangs that have long been associated with petty criminal activity are consolidating into two rival ""blocs"" named Bagdad and Calor Calor. There are indications that these structures are acting as so-called "" oficinas de cobro ,"" or collection offices, which collaborate directly with transnational organized crime. These oficinas offer services such as the ""protection of drug routes and contract killings for other criminal groups, and act as a bridge between Colombian criminal organizations like the Urabenos and traffickers who move drugs to subsequent destinations,"" according to the Panamanian government. There are signs that local groups are operating with increasing independence from their powerful patrons. What's more, Panama's gangs apparently control drug trafficking routes through the country and may even be operating transnationally. Calor Calor and Bagdad ""reportedly have cells in Costa Rica , although it is unclear just how high up their involvement in the drug trade goes."" Across Panama's western border, Costa Rica, which has long been considered the ""Switzerland of Latin America,"" has seen a drastic rise in violent crime associated with the illegal narcotics trade. Between 2000 and 2015, the country's murder rate nearly doubled from 6.3 to 11.5 per 100,000 citizens. Up to 70 percent of the violence has been associated with territorial battles between local drug gangs. This dynamic is new to the country, with Costa Rican Security Minister Gustavo Mata explaining that ""criminality in the country now revolves increasingly around the drug trade, whereas previously it largely consisted of bank robbery, vehicular theft, and kidnapping."" The Evolution of the Gangs To understand the evolution of crime in these countries, it is important to take a step back. Located on a key drug movement corridor, these nations were long ago penetrated by transnational trafficking organizations. As such, gangs in this part of Central America have typically been considered subordinate to Mexican and Colombian cartels. Indeed, captures of foreign criminal emissaries in Panama in 2016 suggested that the nation's ""largest gangs are stepping up their role in domestic drug transport while remaining under the service of Colombian and Mexican cells."" However, there are signs that local groups are operating with increasing independence from their powerful patrons -- a trend not unusual for drug transit countries. In one prominent example from November 2016, Costa Rican authorities claimed they had dismantled the first ever ""criminal structure which managed all aspects of drug trafficking from Costa Rica."" Also last year, Colombian and Panamanian authorities reportedly disbanded an international drug trafficking network led by a Panamanian criminal. The complexity of this organization's activities ""raises the question of whether Panamanian groups continue to act merely as service providers for Colombian and Mexican criminal organizations, or whether they have begun to set up their own transnational trafficking operations."" A greater volume of drugs flowing through the Central American isthmus may further strengthen the power and earnings of local groups. The driving forces behind this growing independence have various facets. On the one hand, it is natural for domestic criminal structures with links to more powerful organizations to make their way up the criminal ladder over time. On the other hand, transnational criminal dynamics also play a key role. Following the collapse of Colombia's powerful cartels, both Panama and Costa Rica have increasingly come under the sphere of influence of Mexican rather than Colombian groups. By the turn of the century in Costa Rica, gangs that had been at the service of Colombians found themselves ""freelancing"" without leadership, and eventually fell under the control of Mexican crime syndicates. However, turmoil in Mexico's underworld may now be forming a new generation of independent groups. ""In recent years, Mexican cartels have experienced a splintering similar to that of their Colombian predecessors, which appears to be providing the space for local groups to take on a bigger role in Costa Rica's illicit drug tr ade,"" we noted in November. "" As a result, whether or not Costa Rica 's drug trafficking organizations continue to evolve may have as much to do with the criminal dynamics in Mexico as with efforts by Costa Rican authorities to dismantle these homegrown structures."" The same could well be true of Panama's more sophisticated gangs. Security Forces in Deep Water There is much room for improvement in these countries' response to the local gang threat. In Costa Rica, the rapid escalation in violence has caught authorities off guard. Following a gang-related massacre on October 2, the security minister himself ""lamented that his agency lacks sufficient financial and human resources to combat growing criminal violence, threatening to resign if the ministry was not allocated additional resources soon."" The Costa Rican government has attempted to boost security efforts by, for example, deploying 400 extra police officers in October to the important seaport of Limon, which has been at the heart of the country's role in the transnational drug trade. The United States has also allocated $30 million in security-related aid to the country. Nevertheless, the ill-equipped government recognizes the need to change its strategy to effectively confront the abrupt deterioration in its security situation. Panama also has to face problems of its own, despite a significant decrease in overall homicides over the past seven years. Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela attributes up to 70 percent of murders in the country to organized crime, and there is evidence that gang dynamics are largely behind clusters of violence, as homicides are highest in the areas with the greatest gang presence. Graphic taken from October 19 article "" Mapped: Where Panama's Gangs are Strongest, Homicides are Highest "" In 2016, President Varela continued to both threaten gangs with tough crackdowns, and offer his signature amnesty and rehabilitation program to thousands of youths. But the efficacy of his mixed strategy is questionable, as the number of gangs in the country has not dropped since he took office in 2014. Future Prospects Looking forward, the most tangible organized crime threat in this stretch of Central America will probably be domestic gangs continuing to step up their activities. In Costa Rica, this could contribute to a further increase in violence as groups struggle for power. But the ""bloc"" gang structures present in Panama could add a bit more stability to its underworld in the imminent future. It is likely that these networks will become more organized, and perhaps transition from their role as go-betweens to assuming greater control over stages in the drug trafficking chain typically run by Mexican and Colombian syndicates. A greater volume of drugs flowing through the Central American isthmus may further strengthen the power and earnings of local groups. Despite numerous suggestions that drug routes from South America to the United States are shifting towards the Caribbean region, there is evidence that the Central American pathway is actually growing in importance. Panama has seen the highest level of drug seizures since the year 2000, and the Costa Rican government has made outlandish predictions that ""1,700 tons of cocaine will be trafficked through Costa Rica in 2016"" -- a hardly credible figure considering that the total worldwide production is closer to 900 metric tons. Perhaps most importantly, the soaring cultivation of coca crops in Colombia -- which borders Panama and is the main supplier of cocaine to the United States -- will probably continue into next year, providing its northern neighbors with even greater supplies of the drug. To add to this, the expansion of Panama's canal, which connects Pacific and Atlantic waters, could widen the gateway for illegal goods being smuggled through the country. Such dynamics illustrate the strategic importance of these two countries for organized crime in the Americas, and indeed worldwide. With such prospects, we may well see Costa Rica and Panama follow in the footsteps of other transit countries, where domestic gangs worked their way to the top echelons of organized crime. The evolution of Mexico's cartels is a prime example, Central America's gangs could soon provide another one."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Argentina Dismantles International Drug Gang, Arrests Clergyman. Authorities in Argentina have dismantled an international drug trafficking gang with links to Colombia, Peru and Uruguay, which included a church pastor, in an operation underlining the growing importance of Argentina in the region's drug trade. In a joint operation by federal and local forces, police made 12 arrests, among them nine Colombians, two Argentines and a Peruvian, and seized more than 100 kilos of cocaine across the capital Buenos Aires, reported Telam. According to Infobae , the group was led by Colombian John Eduard Martinez Grajales, alias ""El Doctor,"" and had links to organized criminal groups in his homeland, the Urabenos and ""Los Machos."" Martinez had operated under the guise of a wealthy businessman since 2009, establishing various businesses alongside his accomplices in Argentina and Uruguay, reported Clarin. The group was observed by authorities meeting at the Buenos Aires branch of the neo-Pentecostal Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International and church pastor David Andres Acevedo Munoz was among the twelve arrested, reported Clarin. The group was also connected to soccer, although the exact nature of the link remains unclear. Members were involved in a group called Football Group International, which Clarin described as ""dedicated to the transfer of footballers,"" while 200 tickets to the Buenos Aires soccer derby between River Plate and Boca Juniors were discovered alongside 170 kilos of cocaine seized in September. The dismantling of this gang indicates that Argentina is home to foreign organized crime activity, with a particular presence of Colombian groups. While it has for years been used as a refuge for Colombian drug traffickers , as well as a location for laundering and investing illicit profits , it appears groups also use it as a base of operations. The lucrative and growing domestic drug market , as well as Argentina's status as a key point of export for cocaine destined for Europe , make it an attractive prospect for Colombian organized crime groups, especially in the face of Mexican domination of the US cocaine market. The growth of drug trafficking in Argentina has been linked to rising youth homicides and an uptick in violence in the north of the country , while Colombian groups involved in human trafficking have also been dismantled recently. The Urabenos are also known to have been present in Argentina previously, with former leader Henry de Jesus Lopez, alias ""Mi Sangre,"" arrested there in 2012 ."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Colombia Navy Seizes 2 Tons Marijuana. Colombia's Navy announced the seizure of 2 tons of marijuana on a boat intercepted on the southern part of the country's Pacific coast. According to the navy's report , after a chase at sea the boat's crew landed in Salahonda, in the province of Narino, and escaped. On board the vessel authorities found more than 2 tons of pressed marijuana, which they said was worth more than $15 million. As InSight Crime has reported , drug seizures along Colombia's Pacific coast have decreased in the past two years as cartels have sought new technology to evade interdiction efforts. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"FARC Names Political Team for Peace Talks. The FARC 's reported negotiating team for peace talks with the Colombian government consists of political rather than military leaders of the group, most with experience of negotiations, which may be a sign of the guerrillas' commitment to the process. The leadership of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) has reportedly settled on the composition of the five-man team that will represent the rebels in an upcoming round of peace talks to be held in Oslo, Norway. El Tiempo, which cites a source in the guerrilla group , reports that the team will be led by Luciano Marin, alias ""Ivan Marquez"" and will consist of the following: the FARC's international representative Rodrigo Granda; Jesus Emilio Carvajalino, alias ""Andres Paris;"" and Luis Alberto Alban Urbano, alias ""Marco Leon Calarca."" The identity of the fifth member is still unclear. The guerrillas officially still insist that Ricardo Palmera, alias ""Simon Trinidad,"" be allowed to participate in the talks , despite the fact that he is serving a prison sentence in the US after being extradited in 2008. However, El Espectador reports that the FARC has chosen Jaime Alberto Parra, alias ""Mauricio Jaramillo"" or ""El Medico,"" as a sixth nominee. As the Associated Press points out, the FARC's representatives come from a largely political background. All of them are seen as strong ideological leaders within the guerrilla organization, and all have participated in negotiations with the government in the past (with the exception of El Medico). This is a positive sign, as it indicates that the FARC are likely taking the process seriously and are committed to its success. If the rebels have indeed selected El Medico as a sixth member of the lead negotiating team, which is meant to consist of five people, it suggests that the FARC are prepared to accept that Simon Trinidad will not be able to attend talks. This removes one potential sticking point from the negotiations."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Tenoch Huerta on Playing Nuanced Caro Quintero in Narcos Mexico. In the middle of the night in the desert of northern Mexico, Rafael Caro Quintero, drunk or high, lobs grenades into a deep hole. One. Two. Three. A huge explosion. A powerful jet of water. The door to what would become a multimillion-dollar business has opened. Viewers are watching the genesis of organized crime as we know it today. It is difficult to know if what we see on screen is true to the facts way or if Netflix embellished it to attract more viewers with a thus far failsafe formula. What is certain is that, when Caro Quintero, Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, alias ""Don Neto,"" discovered how to farm marijuana on a large scale and unite Mexico's main drug players into a federation, they created the organized crime model that would control the economies of much of Latin America. In the fourth season of Netflix's Narcos series, actor Tenoch Huerta's portrayal of infamous Mexican cartel boss Caro Quintero steals the show. He captures the man's charisma, hysteria, and penchant for violence, he maneuvers through the country's political elites and ends up facing charges for kidnapping, torturing and murdering Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena. Caro Quintero served nearly 30 years for these crimes until his 2013 release from prison. Now, the drug lord is believed to be in hiding and protected by local communities in Sinaloa while a new arrest warrant hangs over his head. Huerta spoke with InSight Crime about the challenges of interpreting one of the FBI's most wanted and the impact of organized crime on Mexico. InSight Crime (IC): Narcos seems to have matured in the new season. Tenoch Huerta (TH): I think the series has a new face. They filmed it differently to have wider shots, which allow us to see more. They had the good sense to hire Mexican actors to play Mexican characters, (along with) Mexican directors. I think this helps to give the series depth, credibility and that biting, chili flavor it has. IC: What was it like to play Rafael Caro Quintero? TH: I wanted to play him. Caro Quintero was the character I could contribute the most to. At first glance, he may seem simple, but for me, the question was what in his life led him to be this way. And in searching for the answer, he became a very complex, nuanced character to me. IC: Growing up in Mexico, what memories did you have of him? TH: When I was young, little was known about drug trafficking. Even though Mexico's drug trafficking history goes back over 100 years, we didn't know much about the traffickers themselves. They weren't very public. Caro Quintero became famous because of his controversial statements. My parents told me that they went to a nightclub once, and Caro Quintero arrived with some girls when he was supposed to be in jail. A lot of people have anecdotes of seeing him in bars or at parties when he was supposedly in prison. But aside from that, I wasn't really aware of him. Drug traffickers as a threat became an issue for us with the Guadalajara Cartel, starting with the wars between the Arellano Felix Organization [also known as the Tijuana Cartel], ""El Guero"" Palma [Hector Luis Palma Salazar], and others. And it definitely became a big issue 12 years ago when [former] President Felipe Calderon declared that the war [against drugs] had failed. IC: What do you think about the show's creators choosing that time period in Mexico's history? TH: I think it was a great choice because the Guadalajara Cartel is Mexico's first cartel. While we have a century-long history in the drug trade, especially along the US border -- because let's not forget that they're the ones doing tons of drugs -- [until the Guadalajara cartel] it used to be all local farmers with very low production levels. With the Guadalajara Cartel, we see a cartel as we think of them in modern terms: a structured group with a hierarchy where there is production, distribution, collection, contacts, storage, people who take care of the product, armed security, technology, basically a company. That period is when it all began, when our sad drug trafficking history began. IC: Caro Quintero was a pioneer who created an empire from nothing, but his thirst for power was also his downfall. TH: Obviously if you start a business that makes millions of dollars, you're going to get rich. That's why drug trafficking still attracts so many people, and not just from classes with lower incomes. In Mexico, people who already have money get richer by doing business either directly or indirectly with drug traffickers. For example, we have the scandal where HSBC was accused of laundering drug money. I doubt very much that the bank's executives were street children who watched TV and wanted to get involved in the drug trade and launder money. This is about the ability of money and power to corrupt. (We see) the famous people behind drug trafficking, but we have no idea who is pulling the strings. IC: How does organized crime impact Mexico, and what do you think about the approaches of its different governments? TH: The drug trafficking issue is complex and has many factors, but one of the problems is that there is no social mobility in Mexico. When my father was young, if you got a college degree, you could make it to a different [economic] level in life and change your social position. Now, organized crime -- especially drug trafficking -- is what creates the most mobility in the country. It's brutal. That, plus corruption and impunity, is the perfect breeding ground to send a country, almost blindly, into the grip of crime. IC: That's a discouraging outlook. TH: It is a discouraging outlook, but what's encouraging about it is that people don't want to live that way. I think that, today, Mexicans have a tremendous opportunity to change things, but society has to change them. This is not a job just for the government. IC: Which time period would you portray in season five of Narcos ? TH: The creator of the series told me that drug trafficking in Mexico has so many important moments and so many protagonists that we could do five seasons [just in this country]. I would go by our six-year presidential terms, each one with a different key figure: the Arellano Felix Organization, El Guero, El Senor de los Cielos [Amado Carrillo Fuentes, former head of the Juarez Cartel]. Then we would do those who took their places: the powerful El Chapo, the Beltran Leyva Organization, followed by the crazy part, when the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas got into it with each other, and then the last stage happening now.

Militarization Continues as Mexico Records Most Homicidal Year on Record. Newly unveiled homicide statistics in Mexico confirm that 2017 was in fact the most homicidal year in the country's recent history, underscoring continued problems surrounding strategies used to combat organized crime groups. Authorities in Mexico recorded 29,168 homicides * in 2017, yielding a homicide rate of 22.5 per 100,000 inhabitants -- a 27 percent increase from the number of homicides recorded in 2016. The figure represents the highest national murder tally since records started being kept in 1997, according to data from the Executive Secretariat for Public Security (Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Publica - SNSP).* In 2017, 26 of Mexico's 32 states reported an increase in homicides compared to 2016. The Pacific states of Colima and Baja California Sur recorded the highest homicide rates in the country -- 93.61 and 69.15 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. The western state of Nayarit saw the greatest increase in its homicide rate, skyrocketing 542 percent from 3.1 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016 to 20.1 in 2017, Animal Politico reported. H omicides in Mexico have risen steadily since 2014, increasing by 58.2 percent between then and the end of 2017, according to Animal Politico. The extreme brutality of criminal violence in Mexico was on stark display last year, with reports of clandestine graves , brutal beheadings , executions of young people and the alleged involvement of security forces in murders and disappearances featuring prominently throughout 2017. Despite posting its most homicidal year in recent years, Mexico appears poised to continue using the controversial and counterproductive strategy of relying on increased militarization to combat organized crime groups operating in the country. In December 2017, lawmakers in Mexico approved the Internal Security Law , effectively cementing the military's role in the fight against organized crime groups and codifying the armed forces ability to intervene in domestic security issues. Mexico's armed forces have for years been linked to rights abuses and extrajudicial killings. However, there appears to be growing momentum for a different approach to combating violence and crime. A number of civil society organizations and opposition senators have presented a series of legal actions against the law, describing it as unconstitutional. In addition, Alfonso Durazo, the security advisor for leftist presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, voiced his support for seeking new ways to end the violence in Mexico, including exploring the idea of granting conditional amnesty to Mexico's drug cartel leaders. *This article was updated from its original version to correct the number of homicide victims.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Northwest Mexico Erupts in Violence in Next Generation Cartel Wars. A bloody cartel war raging in the state of Baja California Sur hints at the new strategies and alliances forming as Mexico's fragmented underworld reorganizes. A Zeta magazine investigation into drug war violence in the city of La Paz, the capital of Baja California Sur, has revealed how a spate of macabre murders is connected to a campaign waged by a new alliance between the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG) and the remnants of the Tijuana Cartel against Los Damaso, a network connected to the Sinaloa Cartel. According to Zeta, the CJNG and Tijuana Cartel factions are operating under the name the Tijuana Cartel - New Generation (CTNG) and have been kidnapping, torturing and murdering rivals in an attempt to seize control of local drug sales and distribution. Their targets, according to a Zeta source from the local Public Security Coordination Group (Grupo de Coordinacion de Seguridad Publica), are rival hitmen, operatives that have switched sides, plaza chiefs linked to the Sinaloa Cartel and local drug distributors. Their aim is not only to remove these people but also to obtain information on the large scale Sinaloa distributors that continue providing drugs to the region. However, the source said, identifying the relationship between the local criminal cells and larger cartels is difficult due to the fragmented nature of the current underworld and the constantly shifting allegiences of local networks. The battle for La Paz reflects a new dynamic in the Mexican underworld, as fragmented remains of once all-powerful cartels confront or ally themselves with new players as they compete for control of local as well as transnational criminal markets. The relatively new CJNG has been one of the most expansionist groups in Mexico in recent years, and it is little surprise that it has now moved into Bajo California Sur. It was once believed to be in alliance with the Sinaloa Cartel , but there are now growing signs the organization is looking to capitalize on what appears to be a fragmentation of the Sinaloa Cartel in the wake of the capture of the cartel's most prominent leader, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. In contrast, the Tijuana Cartel has been in long term decline, and so an alliance with an up-and-coming group such as the CJNG represents the remaining cartel factions' best chance of clinging on to some level of criminal power. Los Damaso, meanwhile, have long been operatives for the Sinaloa Cartel. However, there have been numerous reports suggesting the network has been in conflict with other Sinaloan factions. As highlighted by Zeta's source, these national actors are increasingly dependent on alliances with local criminal cells that have more autonomy and less loyalty to larger organizations than in the past. This makes for a much more complex and often chaotic dynamic in this latest generation of Mexico's cartel wars."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Deciphering the Lottery Scam Rings Fueling Violence in Jamaica. Last year's shocking increase in Jamaica's homicide rate has refocused attention on lottery scams in the Caribbean island nation. But it is not a uniquely Jamaican problem, with well-organized lottery frauds operating throughout the Americas, costing the United States hundreds of millions of dollars each year. The total number of killings in Jamaica jumped to 1,192 in 2015, a 20 percent increase from the previous year with the majority believed to be gang-related. Authorities point to violence between lottery scam rings fighting over profits and valuable ""lead"" or contact lists as the major cause of the spike. This type of advance fee fraud usually targets elderly Americans but also fuels gang warfare in the origin country as rival scam rings compete for resources. To give just one example, the massacre of six family members in Kingston last October was linked directly to lottery scam rings. Jamaica's National Security Minister, Peter Bunting, said at the time that this ""heinous crime shows that scamming not only affects those who participate and directly profit from it, but those who associate with them,"" reported Fox News. Advance fee frauds involve calling or emailing unsuspecting targets claiming to offer money -- in the case of lottery scams, a winning ticket -- which can only be redeemed after a fee has been forwarded. (See the Wall Street Journal's graph below of how Jamaican lottery scams work) Other forms of advance fee scams include Nigeria's notorious ""419"" fraudsters , who send out emails offering a range of bogus prizes and rewards, resulting in millions of illicit dollars flowing into the West African nation each year. While US citizens tend to be the main targets of lottery scams, the scammers themselves can come from all across North and Central America. Jamaican fraudsters are currently thought to be the most pernicious, but two years ago a network of US citizens working out of Costa Rica ran a damaging scam operation for years before being brought to justice. In Jamaica and Costa Rica the scams are an undesirable side effect of a burgeoning offshore call center industry, although scams have also originated in Canada, Spain and even the United States. The immediate victims are nearly always the old and infirm. US citizens have been targeted especially by Jamaican fraudsters, and at times the consequences are much more tragic than simply monetary loss. In October 2015, Albert Poland Jr., an 81-year old American man with Alzheimer's and dementia, was driven to suicide after repeatedly sending money to Jamaican lottery scammers. His story drew international attention to the scams, fueled by a widely shared CNN report. Amid this wave of fraud operations targeting US citizens, authorities are taking steps to bring foreign-based scammers to justice. In a landmark case in May 2015, Sanjay Williams became the first Jamaican citizen to be convicted of lottery scamming. Having operated with impunity for years in Jamaica, he was finally captured, extradited, and found guilty of conspiracy, wire fraud and money laundering. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison in December. Several expatriates from the US and Canada have also been arrested and convicted of having managed a lottery scam from Costa Rica, according to the Tico Times. Despite the gains made against some high-profile scammers, challenges remain. Building an extradition case requires amassing first-person affidavits from multiple victims, as well as maintaining a high level of coordination between US and foreign officials. Meanwhile, the potential profits will surely continue to attract more criminal opportunists to lottery scams. The most seasoned scammers can earn several millions of dollars during the course of their criminal career. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation said Williams and another rival ringleader, Lavrock Willocks, had swindled more than $5.6 million from some 80 victims, the Jamaica Observer reported. This is just a fraction of the estimated $300 million that flows to Jamaica from the US every year via lottery scams, according to CNN. The exact connection between drug gangs, which have fragmented since the fall of notorious drug trafficker Christopher ""Dudus"" Coke, and the lottery scam rings remains unclear. It is possible, however, that this fragmentation has caused some drug gangs to move into lottery scams. If true, this would present even greater challenges for authorities struggling to rein in a ballooning homicide rate that consistently ranks among the highest in the region ."	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
"Cattle Rustling Menaces Rural LatAm Communities. In early September, Costa Rica's Security Minister Mario Zamora announced a multi-agency strategy involving security forces, the Public Ministry and the Judicial Investigation Organization. But he wasn't targeting drug trafficking or violence; he was striking out at cattle theft. The announcement came two weeks after a Nicaraguan farmer with connections to Costa Rica was murdered alongside his son near the Costa Rican border in an apparent act of revenge for cattle rustling. So far this year, Costa Rican authorities have reported dismantling four gangs dedicated to cattle theft; a crime they say has escalated in recent months. But Costa Rican authorities are not the only ones concerned about the practice, which afflicts rural communities from northern Mexico to southern Argentina. In July, Nicaraguan National Police Commissioner Aminta Granera declared the crime was growing year on year, as she announced more than 100 cattle rustling gangs had been dismantled in the first six months of 2013. In the absence of a comprehensive regional study on the phenomenon, it is hard to place a value on cattle rustling. In one department of Bolivia alone, $2 million of cattle is reportedly stolen each year. In Colombia, in the first half of 2013 almost 1,300 head of cattle were stolen -- worth approximately $1 million, based on figures from previous years. Meanwhile, the past year has seen reports of a growth in rustling in rural zones throughout the region, including in Colombia , Chile and Mexico. In June, an investigation by Mexican newspaper El Universal highlighted the problem not only of rustling, but also of cattle trafficking. With beef prices almost doubling between Guatemala and Mexico, the newspaper reported an annual influx of up to $30 million of illegally trafficked cattle into the latter country. Cattle rustling has a long history in Latin America and in the 19th century was even employed as a form of rural protest against social inequality. Today in Colombia it is still used by rural insurgents, with left-wing guerrillas stealing cattle to menace landowners, as well as to feed troops and raise funds. However, in most regions it is carried out by small gangs , which sell the cattle locally for quick illegal slaughter, or traffic them to neighboring countries where prices are higher. For that reason, rustling is often felt hardest where cattle pastures are found in borderlands, such as between Costa Rica and Nicaragua , and Uruguay and Brazil. As shown in the El Universal investigation, cattle theft and trafficking can also occur on a much larger scale and involve major transnational drug smuggling groups. It can even be an early step on the path towards transnational organized crime -- as local knowledge and influence over officials is critical to any kind of contraband smuggling, the transportation of one product can easily lead to another. Perhaps the most infamous example of this is Nelson and Javier Rivera -- two former car thieves and cattle rustlers that went on to be key members of one of Honduras' most powerful trafficking networks, the Cachiros. According to El Universal, in Mexico the worlds of cattle rustling and drug trafficking have to some extent begun to merge. El Universal reported that drug-filled condoms had been anally inserted into cattle to smuggle product northwards. At the time of publication, InSight Crime had not received a requested copy of the report this claim was based upon. However, should it be true, with 1.5 million head of Mexican cattle entering the United States each year, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), this poses the question of whether such methods could be, or have been, used to transport drugs into the United States. While cattle rustling is a growing problem in many places in the region, there have also been some success stories in attempts to fight the practice. Uruguay has reported year on year reductions in the crime since 2005. In part this is due to the presence of ""Bepras"" -- brigades dedicated to combating rustling -- which carry handsets to read chips implanted in the ears of all cattle at birth as part of a national registration system in place since 2003. In Chile too, there are positive signs, with a ""frontal war"" on rustling reported to be yielding results following the introduction in June of a new national system of oversight for cattle transportation. However, Uruguay and Chile are two of the countries least afflicted by corruption in the region. Elsewhere registration systems exist, but have been subverted by corrupt officials. In a case in Nicaragua late last year, two deputy mayors from neighboring municipalities were arrested for providing false documentation for stolen cattle. In Mexico, a similar problem exists, with El Universal noting the ease criminals have in acquiring the necessary paperwork to transport cattle northwards from the Guatemalan border region. If cattle rustling is to be truly tackled, then addressing this corruption rather than implementing expensive monitoring systems may be the key."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Calderon Blocks Mexico Victims Law. President Felipe Calderon has held up the passage of a law to compensate victims of violence in Mexico, drawing outrage from campaign groups that backed the move. In April, Mexico's Congress passed a law to oblige the government to protect and offer compensation to those who have been victims of violence or abuse from organized criminal groups. The measure still needed the approval of the president, however, and on Wednesday he sent it back to Congress, seeking modifications. Alfonso Fernandez Aceves, a representative of the Interior Ministry, said in a press conference that the president had not vetoed the legislation, but had asked Congress to fix ""gaps,"" reported Milenio. The government wants municipal and state governments to be constitutionally obliged to help victims, according to Fernandez. He said that this was to make sure that there was no way for the authorities to evade their responsibilities, and that it would be clear who victims should turn to. He said that the government would work with victims' organizations and legislators and officials to improve the bill. The government is also proposing that compensation for victims be paid by the criminals, and not by the ""taxpayer."" If the criminal in a given case lacks the money needed to pay compensation to the victim, the government will pay, but will then charge the criminal. The president's foot-dragging over the law has angered the Movement for Peace, a campaign group which was the driving force behind the proposal. It argues that the 30-day period in which the president can make comments or suggestions on the law expired on June 9, and that he delayed sending it back to Congress in order not to hurt his PAN party's chances in the national elections, held Sunday. The organization's leader Javier Sicilia, a poet who emerged as representative of victims after his son was killed by a drug gang, accused the president of breaking his word. (Image, above, shows him with Calderon in a meeting last year.) While it is certainly plausible that electoral considerations came into play with the timing of the move, it is also possible that that president has a point. The law is likely to work out to be extremely expensive for Mexico, with the maximum amount of compensation set at 934,000 pesos ($70,000) per claim, and some 50,000 people thought to have died in organized crime-related violence in the last six years, with many thousands more victimized in other ways. It could therefore be a good idea to use funds seized from criminals to help fund compensation pay-outs, although given the difficulties of confiscating assets under current Mexican law, this may not be realistic and could even serve as a further roadblock to victims receiving help.

"How the Jalisco Cartel Evolved with Mexicos Drug War. In the competitive and ever-changing environment of Mexico's drug trade, groups like the CJNG and the Knights Templar have kept their position by adopting a regional strategy, rather than expanding across the country. The fact that the CJNG is still growing highlights its adaptability, and willingness to adopt a vigilante discourse when necessary. In recent years, each Mexican criminal organization has had to adapt itself to the militarization of public security and the privatization of violence, which have sent more federal forces onto the streets and led to better-armed cartels. The Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG) and the Knights Templar in Michoacan were formed in a period in which the environment was so adverse that one could say that they have survived almost through a process of natural selection. For their part, the Knights perfected a model of extortion and infiltration of the authorities at the local and state level, which led to the uprising of the Michoacan self-defense groups and ultimately to the weakening of the cartel itself. Meanwhile, their rivals in the CJNG have continued to adapt well to the changing environment. The CJNG arose after the 2010 death of Ignacio ""Nacho"" Coronel , the Sinaloa Cartel's representative in Jalisco, which unleashed a fight for succession. The CJNG won in large part because of its solid ties with the Milenio Cartel , also known as the Cartel of the Valencia brothers, an old criminal structure that dominated Michoacan until the year 2000. For several years it was thought that the Milenio Cartel had been dismantled. However, the leadership of the CJNG by a Michoacan native like Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes , alias ""El Mencho,"" or his son Ruben, illustrates the powerbase left by Milenio. The structures that the group left behind (resources, networks, etc.) have become key in the development of the CJNG. Likewise, the Familia Michoacana, another organization thought to have been dismantled, is key for understanding the origin of the self-defense groups. Not even the arrest of key figures has been able to interrupt the CJNG's regional expansion: it has continued to consolidate in Jalisco, despite the detention of Ruben Oseguera , alias ""El Menchito,"" thought to be second-in-command of the group. In fact, the CJNG's links with Jalisco help explain its success. It is difficult for any criminal group to repeat the Knights Templars' pervasive infiltration of Michoacan's institutions , but neighboring Jalisco offers alternative options for the expansion of a criminal organization. The state capital, Guadalajara, is a stable environment. It is one of Mexico's three main cities, but lacks the institutional presence of Mexico City, or the state of flux Monterrey's criminal environment has seen in recent years. To this is added the historic presence in Jalisco of some of the most important drug trafficking groups (the Guadalajara network, the Sinaloa Cartel, and the Milenio Cartel), which means that there is, presumably, local know-how on money laundering, frontmen and other things that are necessary for the criminal economy. As the dominant group, the CJNG can take advantage of these. One example is the Bahia Banderas region, which includes the cities of Nayarit and Jalisco, and whose money laundering potential was demonstrated by the fugitive Caro Quintero. Tourist site Puerto Vallarta was mentioned by the Jalisco Attorney General's Office as a place where the CJNG has a significant presence, as was the Sierra Occidental, where a mayor was murdered in August. Jalisco also allows easy access to various commercial zones like Manzanillo (Colima state), and the Michoacan port of Lazaro Cardenas, which are key for methamphetamine trafficking. From the security of Jalisco, the CJNG has constructed a regional strategy, in a corridor that includes not just Michoacan but Nayarit, Colima and Guerrero. Its strength seems to have served to attract individuals from this area who are linked to the Sinaloa Cartel. The surprising thing about the CJNG is that its successful strategy of consolidation as a regional power is accompanied by an aptitude for using violence in diverse ways that are naturally integrated with its objectives. One of its most significant acts of violence was the use of a group known as the Mata Zetas (Zeta-Killers) to strike surgically planned, propagandistic blows in zones that were disputed with the Zetas, like Veracruz. Afterwards they withdrew this brand, or, according to some sources, dismantled the force because of its negative impact on public opinion. It is noteworthy that the organization has the capacity to move from these actions, vaguely inspired by paramilitarism , to direct confrontation with the army. This is demonstrated by its various ambushes, such as a May attack in which four soldiers were killed in Jalisco. Meanwhile, in Michoacan, the CJNG has sought alliances with the security forces. With its intervention in the conflict between the self-defense groups and the KnightsTemplar , the Jalisco Cartel identified a highly publicized conflict, infiltrated it, and used its resources to help the authorities and the self-defense groups, with the common aim of weakening the Knights. Its flexible attitude to the use of violence is complemented by its vigilante-style discourse. For example, it has demonstrated the capacity to adopt the authorities' own narrative about the organizations identified as most harmful under each presidency. In the face of the Zetas, the CJNG offered its Mata Zetas (Zeta-Killers). Faced with the Knights Templar, they framed themselves as ""mata-templarios"" (Templar-Killers). The convergence of the CJNG's objectives with those of the security forces suggests that the ""war on drugs"" has pushed criminal organizations to use counterinsurgency discourses in order to strengthen themselves and gain legitimacy, something seen in a more developed form in the Colombian context. It also indicates the extent to which security forces and drug traffickers collaborate in some way to take down the criminal groups perceived as most dangerous. The rise of regional organizations like the CJNG is the result of a period in which cartels face many difficulties in consolidating at a national level. Groups that become the focus of the authorities' attention because of their expansion, like the Zetas, end up fragmented due to actions against them by the security forces. Meanwhile, organizations that tend to coexist with local groups, like the Sinaloa Cartel, leave intact the tools by which the smaller groups can reclaim their autonomy, as happened in Jalisco after the death of Coronel. For that reason it looks unlikely that there will be a new hegemony in Mexican drug trafficking, like the one held by Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo in the previous century , via the Guadalajara network. *Jesus Perez Caballero has a Ph.D. in International Security from the Instituto Universitario General Gutierrez Mellado (Madrid, Spain) and works as an independent investigator on organized crime, drug trafficking and criminal law in Latin America."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Arrested Farmers Deny Cartel Links. Amidst confusing and suspicious circumstances, Mexican authorities say they have arrested eight members of the Peasant Farmer and Popular Organization. The group, ( Organizaciones Campesinas y Populares - COCYP ) -- a Chiapas-based syndicate formed in December 1998, and constituted in Chiapas in August of this year, which fights for the rights of small farmers -- for their connections to the Zetas and the Pelones , two criminal syndicates that are working in concert in the region. The authorities say that during a raid they found weapons, ammunition and two kilograms of marijuana; they add that the COCYP is involved in drug trafficking and kidnapping. However, the COCYP denies the account, adding that the authorities are targeting them for their political platform and their organization's growing presence in Chiapas. If the COCYP is part of the Zetas ' criminal syndicate, it would be an indication of the growing sophistication of that organization, which has had little social message to accompany their bloody, authoritarian tactics. Yet it is far from clear. 	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
Honduras Authorities Covered Up Police Sending Weapons to FARC: Report. An El Heraldo report revealed that top security officials have suppressed internal investigations into a police network that allegedly sold weapons to a Colombian guerrilla group in the early 2000s, yet another illustration of the institutionalized corruption within the force. In March 2003, Estrada Izaguirre, a police officer on assignment in the southern department of Choluteca, sent a report to the director of Honduras' Preventive Police division detailing a police-criminal network operating in the area, according to an investigation by El Heraldo. An aide to the Preventive Police director then sent a note to the head of a separate police division requesting an investigation into Izaguirre's allegations. Both whistleblowers were later killed; Izaguirre just months after filing the complaint, and the aide in July 2007, reported El Heraldo. Neither crime has been solved. Izaguirre's report also included the arrest of a Colombian pilot in Choluteca in 2002. According to El Heraldo, the pilot admitted shortly after his arrest that he had come to pick up 88 AK-47s and one M16 rifle that had been seized during the arrest of a Honduran police inspector in May 2001. The pilot, who was reportedly in the reserves of Colombia's Air Force and a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) guerrilla group, added that he and other pilots had gone to Honduras several times to exchange money and drugs for weapons. A case file based on Izaguirre's 2003 report, which was first registered in 2010 and has been updated as recently as 2016, reportedly shows that police directors and at least two security ministers knew of the investigation but never passed on the information to the Attorney General's Office. Of the 30 police officials and low-ranking officers implicated in the criminal scheme, at least a dozen remain active, including six who serve as sub-commissioners, according to El Heraldo. Moreover, a 2004 internal investigation based on Izaguirre's claims was withdrawn by the implicated officers between 2004 and 2010, the newspaper reported. El Heraldo's report resembles an explosive investigation released last year which found that a network of corrupt police officers were behind the 2009 killing of Honduras' anti-drug czar and the 2011 murder of his assistant. Multiple police directors and security ministers reportedly failed to act on allegations of criminal wrongdoing in both cases, amounting to what appears to be widespread cover-ups. These cases point to institutionalized corruption within the police that is sustained by the system rather than individual officials. It's this type of corruption that authorities are now trying to rid from the police, but their efforts have already been met with resistance. Last year's investigation was the catalyst for the creation of a police reform commission tasked with purging corrupt and inadequate officers from the force. The commission has proven surprisingly effective at investigating and removing both high- and low-ranking officers. But this aggressiveness has created a backlash, with members of the commission reporting death threats and one of them even being the subject of an attack last December .	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
"US Toughens Rhetoric, Declares MS13 Priority Target. In a new escalation in the Trump administration's narrative on the MS13, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that he has named the street gang a top organized crime threat, and a priority target for law enforcement focused on organized crime. As Sessions announced that the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) would be focused on the ""most brutal"" and ""powerful"" of the international gangs threatening the US, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) published its 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment , which tracks illegal drug consumption, trends and overdoses, as well as the most important groups supplying US domestic markets. In that report, the MS13 occupies a marginal role in illegal drug trafficking in the United States. The DOJ asserts that Sessions' decision is ""another step toward fulfilling President Trump's goal of stamping out the brutal transnational criminal organization MS13,"" according to an October 23 press release. The designation, according to the DOJ, will equip the OCDETF with a new ""toolkit"" that will allow them to use laws against drugs, weapons and tax evasion. They will also be able to implement the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to increase the federal government's ability to prosecute the MS13. This decision, the official statement said, would pave the way for collaboration between various agencies of the federal government, such as the DEA, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to more effectively fight the gang. At the meeting in Philadelphia, Sessions asserted that the MS13 is one of the main threats to the domestic security of the United States, and has again equated the street gang with the international drug cartels that Washington accuses of triggering the opioid crisis the country is currently facing. ""We are all facing a deadly lucrative international drug trade. Drugs are killing more Americans than ever before in large part thanks to powerful cartels and international gangs and deadly new synthetic opioids like fentanyl,"" Sessions said. The most brutal among those groups, Sessions again said, is the MS13. Sessions' announcement comes as a result of an increase in violent crimes, mostly homicides, attributed to the MS13 in US cities and counties such as Boston, Massachusetts; Montgomery, Maryland; and Long Island, New York. Throughout 2017, district prosecutors have filed at least a dozen allegations against members of the MS13 in several East Coast courts for cases ranging from homicide to minor drug trafficking and extortion. None of these cases refer to the MS13 as being related to international drug trafficking. Sessions' announcement can be interpreted as a new attempt from Washington to increase its crackdown on the MS13 after the US Treasury Department designated the group a ""transnational criminal organization"" in 2012 under the administration of then-President Barack Obama. It could also be seen as an attempt to provide more legal remedies to prosecutors fighting homicide cases attributed to the gang on the East Coast. What is not clear is how these measures could represent an effective step in the fight against the entry of drugs into the United States. The MS13 is not a major player in transnational drug trafficking and the US State Department, several research centers in Washington, police officers and even the DEA have all acknowledged this. What's even more worrying about Sessions' statement is his failure to acknowledge that the opioid crisis currently ravaging the United States is almost entirely of its own making , as pharmaceutical companies were given the freedom to market and encourage the prescription of painkillers using misleading messages about their addictive nature. The epidemic has, in turn, created new opportunities for organized crime, especially in Mexico, as thousands of users have switched to cheaper, Mexican heroin and that has created a boom for some of the criminal syndicates south of the border. But the MS-13 has little if any connection to opioids of this kind, beyond selling heroin and possibly illicit fentanyl at the street level. Officials in the Washington metropolitan area told InSight Crime the main crimes attributed to the MS13 are homicide, extortion and drug trafficking, which have been confirmed by several prosecutors in indictments against the gang under the RICO act. Special Agent David LeValley, who headed the criminal division of the FBI until December 2016, told InSight Crime that drug trafficking is not the main activity of the MS13. ""In terms of the crimes that they're involved in: certainly lower-level drug distribution, and extortion we see frequently."" For example, near the end of 2015, a Boston prosecutor filed one of the broadest allegations against the MS13 seen in the last decade. He attributed five murders and 19 attempted homicides to about 20 gang members who were members of nine cliques. However, the drug trafficking activities these gang members were allegedly tied to did not mirror those attributed to an international drug cartel. In less than a year, prosecutors alleged that the defendants distributed just five kilograms of cocaine and 600 grams of heroin. ""What we see, and why we make these cases a priority, is the violence,"" Maryland prosecutor William Moomau told the Washington Post. In a DOJ indictment from earlier this year in Maryland against several alleged members of the MS13 charged with homicide, it is stated, for example, that in the weekly meetings held by these gang members, they reported weekly earnings of only $10 from drug trafficking. Since 2014, InSight Crime has reviewed at least a dozen court records filed in Massachusetts, Maryland, Virginia, and New York against several MS13 cliques, and none of them reference the street gang's involvement in international drug trafficking activities. And, when there are references to microtrafficking, it relates to marijuana and cocaine, and almost never opioids. Sessions' comments, like others before them from the Trump Administration, are wildly misleading about the level and nature of the criminal threat posed by the MS13. It could be argued that his words seek to place a homegrown opioid addiction problem that is killing more Americans than any other drug at the doorstep of a criminal gang rather than where it belongs -- at that of the government and pharmaceutical industry."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Captured Sinaloa Cartel Henchman Responsible for 350 Murders. Police in Mexico have captured the alleged head of Sinaloa Cartel operations in Chihuahua, who is closely linked to cartel leader ""El Chapo"" Guzman, and is believed to be responsible for at least 350 homicides. Mario Nunez Meza, alias ""El Mayito"" or ""M10,"" arrested on August 28, was one of the Mexican government's 122 most wanted men and a target of the international police body, Interpol, as well as the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He has an outstanding warrant for his arrest on drug trafficking charges in Texas , and is the subject of at least 30 investigations according to officials cited by El Informador. Nunez is believed to be responsible for the murder of over 350 people, many of whom were found in 23 clandestine graves in Durango state, as well as the killing of three anti-kidnapping agents in Chihuahua, reported Milenio. He began his career as a municipal police officer in the state capital of Ciudad Juarez, but later deserted and joined the ranks of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman's Sinaloa Cartel. Border state Chihuahua is one of Mexico's murder hotspots. In 2008, the Sinaloa Cartel invaded the state's biggest city, Ciudad Juarez, and waged war on the Juarez Cartel, earning the place the title of ""most dangerous city in the world."" Nunez, from the mountains of Durango, was one of several leaders of this offensive and gained notoriety for his ultra-violence -- locally his name is associated with thousands of deaths. In 2011, he was also reportedly among a group of Sinaloa Cartel ""extremists"" who were apparently targeted by both the cartel leadership and the government, retreated to Durango and were thought to have been ""cleaned out"" by July 2010. However, according to Mexican media , Nunez continues to be one of Chapo Guzman's ""men of confidence,"" and also a link to US security forces, providing information about Sinaloa Cartel enemies, the Juarez Cartel and its Zetas-aligned armed branch ""La Linea."" to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Nunez's capture is, however, another of recent indications -- among them the US blacklisting of five Sinaloa associates and the arrest of another cartel head in the region -- that authorities may be increasingly targeting the mighty cartel, making for a tardy response to long running accusations that both US and Mexican officials have favored and protected the organization.

"Arrest of Major FARC Dissident Casts Doubt on Colombia Peace Accords. The arrest of a powerful FARC dissident in Colombia illustrates how intensifying criminalization of ex-guerrilla may prevent the government from fully implementing the 2016 peace accords it signed with the group. In a joint operation, the Colombian National Police and Attorney General's Office arrested Luis Eduardo Carvajal Perez, alias ""Rambo,"" in the town of Puerto Rico in the southwestern department of Caqueta, El Tiempo reported on July 4. The news outlet did not mention the date of the arrest, and there has been no official announcement about it. The government plans to extradite the former member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) to the United States, based on accsations that he continued involvement in drug trafficking after the signing of the peace agreement. As a commander in the Western Bloc (Bloque Occidental) for more than 15 years, Rambo headed the the Daniel Aldana Mobile Column, the FARC's most active military and financial structure in southern Colombia. In January 2017, he and 300 other guerrilla fighters demobilized and moved to a United Nations-supervised concentration zone in the southwestern department of Narino. At the time of his arrest, Rambo allegedly controlled the important Narino port city of Tumaco as well as territory along the border with Ecuador and the main cocaine exit points from Colombia's Pacific coast. Half of the coca produced in Colombia is grown in the region where Rambo allegedly operated. In just the first half of this year, authorities have seized 65 metric tons of coca, 45 of which was linked to a dissident group led by Walter Arizala Vernaza, alias ""Guacho,"" a close associate of Rambo. By 2015, US authorities identified Rambo as one of Narino's foremost drug traffickers. He allegedly collected a ""tax"" on coca production in addition to overseing his own production and processing laboratories and managing trafficking routes to Central America. Rambo's presumed knowledge about drug trafficking routes and his contacts within international criminal groups mean his arrest could be a blow to criminality in southern Colombia. The arrest also highlights fears that FARC members with past involvement in drug trafficking are at risk of falling back into the game. The Colombian government's implementation -- or lack thereof -- of the peace accords has always served as a starting point when discussing the criminalization of demobilized FARC members. Rambo himself pointed this out at the beginning of the disarmament process. In an interview conducted by InSight Crime at the beginning of 2017 at an encampment for demobilized FARC members, Rambo expressed doubts regarding fulfilment of the promises made to the guerrilla group by the Colombian government. ""They always say they're coming, that in eight days they're going to have everything ready. But those eight days go by and nothing. So, you really realize what this system is actually like. The policy is based on lies, and then these people get used to that,"" he said. Rambo also said that coca and everything its profits finance would continue to cause tension in the process, while maintaining that coca traders should pay taxes. ""The farmers aren't taxed. Everywhere you go it's declared that those working directly with the business have to pay,"" he said. At the time of the interview, Rambo denied involvement in other criminal activities such as drug production and trafficking. However, he added that rural communities would reject crop eradication, a mainstay of the government's counter-narcotic strategy. ""The people took the peace agreement seriously. That's why they are rejecting eradication by the government,"" Rambo told InSight Crime. The implementation of the peace agreement failed to take into account how the demobilization and reincorporation processes might need to differentiate between various types of FARC members. Given their positions within the guerrilla organization and involvement with drug trafficking, demobilizing members sought not only compliance with the agreement, but also a balance with regard to their ability to make a living in a civilian setting. Rambo's risk of criminalization was extremely high. He allegedly returned quickly to criminal activities well-armed with strategic knowledge about contacts, modus operandi and drug trafficking routes. But this time he seems to have sought more benefits for himself. Rambo's presumed return to the criminal world illustrates the risk the Colombian government takes when its implementation of the peace agreement with the FARC is perceived as inconsistent. Defections could increase, further filling the ranks of the dissidents and strengthening their connections. This could then lead to more disputes with other criminal groups for control over drug trafficking routes, especially when the downfall of a person like Rambo leaves a power vacuum."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"US Aid to El Salvador: The Anti-Plan Colombia?Six months after signing a partnership agreement aimed at improving rule of law in El Salvador, the US says the plan is on the right track. Even more promisingly, it looks like the pact may avoid some of the mistakes of other model security agreements, like Plan Colombia. On his visit to El Salvador in March 2011, President Barack Obama unveiled several aid initiatives to improve security in the country, one of the most violent in the hemisphere thanks to drug trafficking and crime. Obama and President Mauricio Funes announced the Partnership for Growth , an aid model introduced by the Obama administration and sold as an ""unprecedented bilateral collaboration"" led by the recipient country rather than the donor. A team made up of US and Salvadoran officials carried out an analysis of the factors constraining the country's economic development, identifying crime and insecurity, as well as low productivity, as the biggest blocks to growth. In November the countries signed a Joint Action Plan to address these constraints, set to run until 2015. The principles of Salvador's Partnership for Growth are in many ways the antithesis of the massive US aid program for Colombia, launched in 2000. Through Plan Colombia, the US poured some $8 billion in mostly military aid into the country, which was used to build up the armed forces and carry out large-scale coca eradication. The aim was to attack the drug trade and defeat illegal armed groups, and in this respect it had significant successes. The Partnership for Growth, by contrast, does not involve the commitment of any new funds, but rather increased cooperation between various US agencies, making existing work by them and by the Salvadoran government more effective. Its aims are narrower -- the partnership focuses on the effects of organized crime, namely violence and chaos which hold back human development in the country, rather than on using force to try to put an end to the drug trade itself. The emphasis is on the transfer of expertise, rather than the injection of billions of dollars. The plan's approach to the crime and insecurity aspect is two-pronged: strengthening Salvadoran institutions, and preventing crime and violence. A major reason behind this pared-down approach is that the US has neither the resources nor the will to give billions to El Salvador's armed forces. The War on Terror has replaced the War on Drugs as the foreign policy focus, and the financial crisis has put budgets under strain. The US has historically committed far less funds to Central America than to Colombia or Mexico -- the Obama administration requested $107.5 million for the whole of Central America via CARSI in FY2013, while Colombia is set to receive over $442 million in various types of aid from the US in that year. However, it could also be that the US government has absorbed some of the lessons of Plan Colombia. In a report released last year, the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) called the massive aid project a ""cautionary tale"" for future US efforts in the region. According to WOLA, the failings of Plan Colombia point to the need for future US aid efforts to strengthen civilian government, cut impunity, and create opportunities for excluded sectors of society. It said that the US should not promote militarization in recipient countries, and that programs should be tailored to the specific situation of the country, and accompanied by regular evaluations. Scorecards to measure the progress of the Partnership for Growth will be drawn up every six months. The first evaluation , released in July, found that the program goals were on track in all but two of the 14 crime and insecurity metrics. One of the key goals of the partnership is to strengthen Salvador's justice and security institutions. The action plan says that the country's institutional weaknesses prevent an effective response to crime, and calls for a ""holistic, comprehensive strategy"" across different bodies, with reform for prosecutors, police officers, judges, and security personnel. The six-month scorecard says that these efforts are on target. Some 242 justice sector personnel have been trained by US agencies so far, and a new Inter-Institutional Investigation Manual, meant to improve and standardize investigative procedures, has been distributed to police and prosecutors. The partnership also sets the target of increasing the confiscation of criminal assets, and using them to fund law enforcement. The aim is to to get an effective asset forfeiture law passed, and strengthen financial investigation units. This is on target, according to the report. Draft laws on confiscation and using assets to fight crime have been drawn up, and will go before the National Assembly later this year. This kind of work to dismantle the financial networks of criminal organizations is important for breaking up these structures in the long term and making El Salvador a less attractive site for traffickers to base their operations. Another target in the institution-strengthening part of the plan is to protect small businesses from the impact of crime -- this is particularly relevant in El Salvador, where extortion is the main source of income for the ""mara"" gangs. Extortion is often targeted against small, local businesses, and is a particularly violent crime as it necessarily involves spreading fear in the population, in order to guarantee that payments are made. The metric is also classed as on-target: the US has stationed a Resident Legal Advisor to help with the implementation of task forces combating crime against businesses. The scorecard also points to the Salvadoran police force's new anti-gang unit. This force of some 302 officers has been specially trained in investigative techniques and in the activities of gangs, and began operations in April. The kind of institution-building and reform set out in the first section of the scorecard is perhaps the most important contribution that can be made to cutting crime and violence in El Salvador, where corruption and inefficiency in the police and judiciary have allowed organized crime to develop to its current level. The second prong of the partnership is crime prevention. This, with a focus on strategies to stop young people joining gangs and bringing in community policing techniques, comes in contrast to the repressive measures employed in El Salvador in the past. The ""Mano Dura"" policy, brought in in 2003, took a hard line against gangs, criminalizing membership and locking up thousands of young people, but the result was to force the groups to regroup and reorganize. The schemes set out in the partnership include programs to get young people into employment or education, to prevent them from joining gangs in the first place. The report sets out several measures taken so far by the US agencies, including making alliances with companies to help young people get jobs, and training some 600 at-risk youths. It also notes the Salvadoran government's plan for ""Special Parks for Social Reinsertion and a Culture of Peace."" These parks are intended to help high-risk individuals find work opportunities, and the government has said it will roll them out to benefit 70,000 people across the country. However, as InSight Crime has commented , so far the government hasn't explained where the projected $20 million to pay for the reinsertion scheme would come from, or which companies would be willing to hire former gang members. The evaluation says that data on the number of people who find employment through the scheme will be reported at the next six-month scorecard. The plan places special emphasis on instituting community policing across the country. One model program has been instituted in five municipalities, and is working smoothly enough to warrant its expansion, the evaluation says. According to the scorecard, a community policing program in Lourdes has brought about a 40 percent drop in violent crime. However, the job of police reform in El Salvador is enormous, and it remains to be seen if these kind of model programs (also in place in Guatemala and Honduras) merely set up isolated pockets of good practice or can be spread across the country. It is far too early to evaluate the success of the partnership for growth. Many of the projects it sets out are good ideas, targeted to the specific problems of El Salvador. Even more encouragingly, it appears that the plan is avoiding some of the failures of Plan Colombia, which took a heavily militarized approach to security, building up the armed forces at the expense of justice institutions. If the US-El Salvador partnership stays on track, as the six-month score card says it has so far, both countries may soon be able to point to some very visible successes in terms of strengthening El Salvador's badly weakened institutions.

"What Does Departure of Top US Anti-Drug Diplomat Mean for LatAm Policy?The planned resignation of the US State Department's top anti-drug official raises further questions about the future of US counternarcotics efforts in Latin America, against a backdrop of uncertainty surrounding the policy preferences of the administration of President Donald Trump. William Brownfield, the US Assistant Secretary of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) since January 2011, told State Department staff that he would resign by the end of September, Foreign Policy reported on August 27. The long-time State Department official will reportedly join what the news outlet called an ""exodus that is thinning the ranks of America's most experienced career diplomats"" amid planned budgetary cuts and structural changes that have strained relations between the US diplomatic apparatus and the White House. Brownfield, who previously served as ambassador to Colombia, Venezuela and Chile, has long been an advocate of traditional anti-narcotic measures focused on interdiction and eradication efforts. ""He's been a staunch drug warrior and a true believer in a lot of the traditional doctrine of drug eradication [and] interdiction, the same kind of metrics that drug warriors have been using for so many decades,"" said Sanho Tree, a drug policy expert at the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) who has followed Brownfield's career for years. Other experts consulted by InSight Crime did not question Brownfield's commitment to this basic policy framework, but also credited him with expanding the focus of US anti-drug efforts beyond enforcement alone to include more holistic approaches to the issue. What is undeniable is that Brownfield oversaw an important evolution in US counternarcotics policies in recent years. The question now is what comes next. Mixed Legacy Brownfield's six-year stint as the head of INL saw significant shifts in US anti-drug policies abroad, and led to the development of what some have called the "" Brownfield Doctrine ."" Rather than blindly enforcing international drug control treaties that many consider outdated or too enforcement-centric, the head of INL called for a more flexible and comprehensive approach to the transnational drug issue. ""Things have changed since 1961,"" Brownfield said in a 2014 speech at the United Nations, referring to the year the UN adopted the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the backbone of the international drug control regime. ""We must have enough flexibility to allow us to incorporate those changes into our policies to tolerate different national drug policies, to accept the fact that some countries will have very strict drug approaches; other countries will legalize entire categories of drugs,"" he added. However, this type of rhetoric sometimes seemed at odds with the concrete manifestations of US anti-drug policy during Brownfield's tenure. For example, he told the New York Times in 2012 that ignoring so-called ""soft side"" aspects of drug control would be a mistake. ""If your drug policy is an exclusively 'hard side' negative policy, it will not succeed There has to be a positive side: providing alternative economic livelihoods, clinics, roads -- the sorts of things that actually give poor communities a stake in their future so they do not participate in narcotics trafficking,"" Brownfield said. But he also praised US cooperation with the Honduran military and law enforcement on efforts to disrupt drug trafficking through the Central American country, despite the fact that an operation led by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) at the time was causing outcry in Honduras over the deaths of several civilians in an apparently botched raid. And at times, Brownfield outright advocated for US partner nations to take tougher stances on drug control. For instance, he cautioned in a recent US congressional hearing that "" bilateral problems "" could result from a failure on the part of Colombian authorities to implement more heavy-handed measures to eradicate increasing coca cultivation, which has contributed to rising cocaine production. Although Brownfield highlighted the need to incentivize ""participation in the government's crop substitution effort,"" he also called on Colombian officials to ""limit the number of voluntary eradication agreements they negotiate."" And pointing to anti-eradication demonstrations by coca farmers , he suggested offering greater authority to security forces to use force in the course of eradication efforts. Tree, the IPS fellow, critiqued Brownfield's backing of these types of policies. However, he also acknowledged that the diplomat did not create the decades-old drug policy framework, but rather inherited it. And other powerful actors such as the US congress also played a role in shaping its evolution. Michael Shifter, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a non-profit, made similar comments. Shifter acknowledged that ""there was a disjuncture between a lot of the rhetoric and what was done on the ground,"" though he added he believes this was more likely the result of bureaucratic barriers than Brownfield's lack of action. ""I think he understood the importance of a broader approach [even as] he emphasized the traditional policies,"" Shifter told InSight Crime. Eric Olson, the Deputy Director for the Latin American Program at the Wilson Center, told InSight Crime that while Brownfield was certainly a ""big believer"" in traditional anti-drug measures, he also oversaw a broadening of counternarcotics efforts to include the strengthening of local justice and law enforcement forces as part of INL's mandate. ""He was a transitional figure within the INL. There was a time in which INL was only about narcotics, a lot of 'IN' and very little 'L',"" Olson said. What's Next? With cocaine consumption and overdoses on the rise and an increasing number of deaths related to the opioid crisis in the United States, drug policy has once again taken a central place in US political conversations. But the Trump administration so far has generally struggled to formulate a coherent approach to the issue, and Brownfield's reported resignation adds to uncertainty about the future of US counternarcotics policy in Latin America. Tree said it is unlikely that a potential Brownfield successor under Trump would expand on the INL head's legacy of pushing for more holistic approaches to drugs, especially given the administration's seeming preference for tough talk on security issues. In fact, Tree pointed to the possibility that actors in favor of traditional anti-narcotic measures could exploit the current institutional turmoil at the State Department and a broader context of political volatility in the White House in order to jockey for a more prominent place in the wake of Brownfield's departure. ""It will either stay the same, or it will change for the worse in terms of more enlightened or progressive policies,"" Tree said. Olson and Shifter both said they suspect US anti-drug policy in Latin America will stay on ""autopilot"" after Brownfield leaves as a result of bureaucratic inertia and other factors that tend to militate against sudden, drastic changes to longstanding national security policies. There has been speculation that Brownfield might be leaving his post at INL to move to the position of assistant secretary for western hemisphere affairs, where he would focus more specifically on Latin America but less specifically on the drug issue. However, an unnamed ""senior official"" who spoke to Foreign Policy told the news outlet it was ""unlikely that Brownfield would be taking on any other top posts in the administration."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Homemade Guns Point to Perus Gang Struggles. Police in Peru's capital seized a cache of guns apparently made out of iron pipes by local street gangs, illustrative of how the intense, highly localized conflict between neighborhood gangs has pushed even the most low-level groups to arm themselves. Lima police reported seizing the nine homemade pistols -- iron pipes crudely welded together into 'T' shapes -- after breaking up a gang fight in the northern district of Comas. A youth fleeing the scene dropped a backpack containing the handmade weapons and a box of .38 calibre bullets. Police said that one of the crude weapons could be made for around 30 soles (about $11), and could be bought on the black market for between 2 to 3 soles (about 77 cents to $1.15), reports Peru 21. As InSight Crime has reported , Peru's government has said there are a total of 13,000 gang members inside the country, compared to an estimated 14,000 gang members in Guatemala and 10,500 in El Salvador, both of which have much smaller populations than Peru. According to a report by Infosur , more than 12,000 of these estimated gang members are based in Lima and the nearby port city Callao. The approximate 430 gangs in the region are also known to arm themselves with machetes, whips, stones, and metal, the report states. The apparently primitive state of the weaponry used by some of Lima's gangs is a symptom of their essentially petty nature. While there are homegrown groups in Peru's rural jungles involved in organized criminal activities like the transnational trafficking of drugs, urban gangs have not yet established any significant connections to organized crime. Such links allow gangs to access bigger profits and better weaponry. In contrast, ties between elements of the Mara Salvatrucha ( MS-13 ) and organized crime has allowed the group to significantly expand their arsenal if not their criminal purview. And while Peruvian gangs are capable of great violence in Lima -- some of it related to the fight over extortion -- so far there is little evidence that they have ties to international drug trafficking networks. The Lima-based gangs are not the only ones scrappy enough to resort to DIY weaponry. A 2010 video report by Colombian TV network Caracol shows youth groups in an impoverished Bogota neighborhood making their own guns out of metal scraps and duct tape.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"FARC Rebels Still Kidnapping in Colombia: Report. Colombian police reported that 292 cases of kidnapping were registered in 2013, of which 32 could be directly traced to the FARC, despite the rebel group's promise to cease the practice -- a government precondition for peace talks. In February 2012, the rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) announced they would cease the practice of ""retentions"" (the guerrilla word for kidnapping), which was a government precondition for sitting down and negotiating an end to the 50-year civil conflict. In September 2012 the peace talks formally began and continue in Havana, Cuba. However a statement from the police anti-kidnapping unit, the GAULA, stated it had traced 32 abductions directly to the FARC, although the vast majority of kidnappings, 76 percent, were carried out by common criminals. The total of registered kidnappings in 2013 was 292, a slight decline on the year before, which saw 305 cases, but way down from a decade earlier, when Colombia was the world kidnap capital with 2123 registered cases, and the FARC were far and away the principal abductors. While the order from the FARC ruling body, the seven-man Secretariat, has been largely obeyed, it is clear that some guerrilla front are still engaging in kidnapping for ransom. This is most likely the case for fronts that do not operate in drug producing areas, or where there is not a large number of companies or urban centers from where they can engage in extortion. There is evidence that some FARC units are profiting from kidnapping, but subcontracting the operations to other groups. Foremost among them is their allies of the National Liberation Army (ELN), who have not renounced kidnapping and were responsible for at least 29 cases in 2013. The GAULA head, General Humberto Guatibonza, said that they had detected a trend whereby kidnappings are carried out by common criminals, but the ransoms are charged by the FARC. He said they had tracked cases of this in the provinces of Antioquia, Arauca, Cauca and Valle del Cauca. It may be that common criminals use the name of the FARC when they come to charging ransoms, figuring that the rebel reputation could ensure more rapid payment. While there may be some exceptions, for the most part FARC units have obeyed the order to halt kidnapping. What has been seen is an increase in extortion, even as kidnappings have declined, as the rebels fill their coffers by diversifying their revenue streams."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Ecuador Inmates Killed Amid Prison Crisis. A string of inmate deaths after the deployment of extra troops and police to Ecuador's prisons illustrates that sending in reinforcements is not enough to end the country's prison crisis. On July 23, the dead body of an inmate known as ""El Gato"" was found in the Turi prison, in the city of Cuenca in southern Ecuador, El Universo reported. The previous day, a riot left two inmates dead and a guard injured in a Latacunga prison, some 90 kilometers to the south of Quito. The violence took place during an inmate uprising in protest of poor prison conditions. Twenty-two people in Ecuador's detention centers have met with violent deaths in 2019, El Universo reported. Of these, 14 have occurred since President Lenin Moreno declared a state of emergency on May 16 , which sent the armed forces to secure the perimeters of all the nation's prisons and the police into jails to provide extra manpower. The state of emergency alone has not prevented this spate of inmate deaths, highlighting that more needs to be done to tackle the worrying issues facing Ecuador's penitentiary system. Following the death of six inmates at the Litoral prison, former Prison Director Alfredo Munoz said the prisons were a ""time bomb."" According to El Universo estimates, the country's jails are 40 percent over capacity , with 40,006 inmates living in buildings designed to hold up to 28,554 people. Three gangs -- Los Gorras, Los Cubanos and Los Choneros -- have also mutated into larger criminal structures that are battling to control drug trafficking and other illicit activities on the streets and within a number of the country's prisons, according to a report by El Comercio. As previously reported by InSight Crime, gang conflict intensified after the murder of Los Cubanos' leader, William Humberto Poveda Salazar, alias ""El Cubano,"" who was decapitated and burned in a Guayaquil prison on June 11. In addition, the prison gangs benefit from the flow of drugs, weapons and contraband into the prisons. During the first six months of the year, searches of cell blocks yielded 1,552 cellphones, 30 kilograms of drugs, 16 firearms, 163 rounds of ammunition, 2,538 liters of liquor, 5,960 knives, 440 electronic devices and $15,436 in cash, Deputy Interior Minister Patricio Pazmino reported. Ecuador is also showing worrying signs of state abandonment of prisons, or wholesale participation in criminal activities. This would bring it closer to the likes of Brazil , El Salvador, and Mexico , where gangs are the de facto rulers of many jails with prison authorities often acting as accomplices. Ecuador's prisons suffer from a lack of investment and resources while prison guards are overworked and underpaid, both of which facilitate corruption. A prison official previously told InSight Crime that drugs and weapons were moved into the prisons by high-ranking officials and even prison directors."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Colombias Coca Farmers in Legal Dilemma That May Jeopardize New Drug Policy. Colombia's government is intent on passing a law that will grant a one-year judicial immunity for small-scale coca farmers who agree to abandon their illegal cultivations, which is a provision of the government's peace deal with the FARC. Without guaranteeing that farmers will not be jailed in the short term, there is little hope that they will voluntarily switch to alternative crops as part of the government's new substitution program. But while drafting the law, Colombia's government came up against an impossible dilemma: what to do with the 40 percent of farmers who not only cultivate the coca leaf, but also process it into coca paste, according to the latest report on illegal cultivations by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Technically, the government could still explicitly include them in the law, since the peace deal it is adhering to calls for the temporary protection of ""small-scale coca farmers."" One could argue that farmers who also process coca leaf only do so because they are ""cocaleros,"" or coca growers, meaning that processing coca is a secondary practice. *This article was translated, edited for clarity and length and published with the permission of La Silla Vacia. It does not necessarily represent the views of InSight Crime. See the Spanish original here. But this decision would significantly add to the political cost of a project that has already been controversial for offering temporary amnesty solely to coca growers. Including those who gain higher profits at this stage in the cocaine production chain would receive even greater criticism. ""It would be political suicide because it would leave the door wide open for the attorney [general] and opposition members to say that it's not only the farmers that are being demobilized,"" a narcotics expert told La Silla. But leaving them out of the amnesty law could create a time bomb that might explode further down the line, should the Attorney General's Office decide to prosecute small coca farmers who have signed up for government substitution programs on charges that they have processed coca leaf. Coca farmers may interpret this as a violation of the crop substitution agreements signed with the government, and of the peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). Hence the heated debate. ""From the beginning, discussions within the government concerning the issue [on the legal protection of coca leaf processors] have been very tough,"" a government source told La Silla. ""Here at the Ministry of Justice we have been very insistent on the need to intervene against [coca leaf] processing and that there can't be any sort of penal alternative for them. They must be pursued,"" we were told by Vice Minister for Criminal Policy and Restorative Justice Carlos Medina. This is why the government has chosen to exclude them from the law's current draft, La Silla was told by two sources with access to the document. But avoiding political confrontation today could pave the way for trouble further down the road. The business The number of coca farmers participating in the processing stage -- in which they transform coca leaf into paste in artisanal laboratories -- is rising continuously, according to a report on the National Crop Substitution Program (Programa Nacional de Sustitucion de Cultivos - PNIS) by the Ideas for Peace Foundation (Fundacion Ideas para la Paz - FIP). This is particularly true in Narino, Putumayo and Norte de Santander, the departments with the greatest coca fields, according to UNODC figures. Coca farmers are primarily spurred by economic incentives. Processing the leaf generates higher profits, as shown by the UNODC's price estimates. While 1 kilogram of coca leaf can be sold for 2,900 Colombian pesos (just under $1), 1 kilogram of coca paste (which requires 125 kilograms of leaf, at a cost of 362,000 pesos ($120)) will be sold at 1,895,700 pesos ($625). Even when considering additional supply costs, the profitability of processing coca is significantly higher. And it is also easier to move coca paste, as it saves money on transport costs and is easier to hide than piles of leaves. ""The increase in what here we call 'kitchens' is significant. Many people quickly learned to process the leaf into paste, even if it's low quality. They sell it at a better price and it's easier to transport,"" an anonymous source from Tumaco told La Silla. And it is also cheap to set up an artisanal kitchen. ""Here, farmers invest between 300,000 and 500,000 pesos ($100 - $165) max to set up a kitchen and buy the gasoline, cement and some chemicals needed to make the paste. It's not rocket science,"" La Silla was told by a source in Putumayo who chose to remain anonymous due to the risks of discussing the subject. It is generally difficult for farmers to process coca beyond the paste stage, which is not consumable. Making cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) requires more complex laboratories and other precursor chemicals that are both harder to acquire and to use. Which is why just 1 percent of farmers participate in this second processing phase, the UNODC report states. Farmers started processing coca leaf several years ago, when US aid initiative Plan Colombia boosted the capacity of the country's security forces to destroy large clandestine laboratories. But information obtained by La Silla indicates that the trend has grown stronger since the government launched its campaign to forcefully eradicate 50,000 hectares of coca during 2017. This has been happening, for instance, in Colombia's top coca-producing department of Narino. In its port municipality Tumaco, where 16 percent of the country's coca fields are located, farmers' participation in processing has become the norm due to falling leaf prices. A unit of coca leaves dropped from 50,000 pesos ($16.5) to 15,000 (just under $5) in recent months, a source told La Silla. And while the price of paste has also dropped, it remains preferrable to leaves not only because it is better to transport and hide. Paste does not decompose as easily -- an important quality at a time when the market is stagnating under heavy pressure from security force operations. Indeed, police and the military have destroyed 20 laboratories and 74 artisanal kitchens; captured 20 individuals; seized 2,992 kilograms of cocaine and 214 kilograms of paste. Similar dynamics have played out in Policarpa municipality. After the government eradicated locals' coca fields nine months ago, leaving many people jobless, 75 percent of urban inhabitants are now dedicated to processing coca leaf, according to a community representative. ""You have to live off something,"" the local source said. In the Catatumbo region, coca leaves have a higher alkaloid concentration and render higher quantities of coca paste, therefore more people are processing due to the product's increased profitability. The prices here are also higher than in other parts of the country, with 1 kilogram of leaves worth 3,300 pesos (just over $1) and that of paste worth 2.4 million (nearly $800), according to a source from national agency coordinating the development of rural areas (Agencia de Renovacion del Territorio - ART). A dilemma with heavy consequences In the face of these economic realities, the government has opted to exclude the processing of coca leaves from the list of crimes exempt from criminal prosecution. This decision bears heavy consequences. As it stands, small-scale coca farmers with artisanal laboratories are considered participants in the secondary cocaine production echelon. This puts them at risk of future prosecution -- and possible incarceration -- even if they have signed and are fully complying with government crop substitution programs. As a result, there is a high risk that many farmers will opt out of the PNIS and thus maintain their criminal economy. Nonetheless, any government attempt to pressure judicial authorities into sparing farmers involved in coca processing could backfire by fueling another scandal. For as much as the coca grower may bear the image of a humble farmer with no alternatives, a processor's image is that of a drug trafficker. At the end of the day, the decision to not explicitly include processors in the law bill, while simultaneously hoping that those same farmers do not abandon the PNIS, is actually a gamble on the likelihood that the Attorney General's Office will not be capable of prosecuting them, aside from isolated cases that do not jeopardize the legitimacy of the substitution agreements in the eyes of other coca processors. Perhaps for this reason a government source who requested anonymity La Silla that ""the Attorney General's Office doesn't have the capacity to go after them all."" The question now is what the final law will stipulate, and whether it will be modified as it passes through congress. *This article was translated, edited for clarity and length and published with the permission of La Silla Vacia.

"Could Miami Cannibal Drug Gain Ground in Latin America?Synthetic drugs like the one that reportedly sparked a vicious attack by the infamous ""Miami cannibal"" are becoming increasingly popular in Latin America, as production of drugs like cocaine falls. Miami police on Saturday shot dead a man after he refused their orders to stop chewing off the face of a homeless man. Officials claim that the assailant, 31-year-old Rudy Eugene (pictured, on the right), may have been under the influence of a synthetic drug known as ""bath salts."" The drug -- which contains the amphetamines mephedrone and methylone -- has been known to cause delusions of grandeur and psychotic behavior among repeat users. According to Louisiana Poison Center director Mark Ryan, the side effects of the drug are unprecedented. ""If you take the worst attributes of meth, coke, PCP, LSD and Ecstasy and put them together, that's what we're seeing sometimes,"" Ryan told the New York Times in July. Surprisingly, the drug has been sold online and in convenience stores in the United States since 2009. Although the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued a ban on the drug's active chemicals in October, bath salts remain widely available in the United States. And the drug is finding its way to market elsewhere in the hemisphere as well. Chile's La Nacion reported that it had become available in the country as a party drug, and was easily purchased in bulk on the Internet. Chemical expert Luis Alberto Lindermeyer told the paper that although the use of bath salts is not widespread in Chile, its popularity in the club scene could fuel broader consumption in the coming years. The rise of bath salts in Chile is part of a broader trend, as designer drugs become increasingly popular across the region. According to the United Nations' most recent World Drug Report , a drop in cocaine and heroin production has been offset by a rise in the sale of synthetic drugs in the hemisphere. In addition to the most popular synthetic drugs -- Ecstasy or MDMA, methamphetamines and LSD -- these include chemical variants of amphetamines, like bath salts, ""spice,"" a largely legal alternative to cannabis with dangerous side effects, and Piperazine, an anti-parasitic drug often used as a substitute for MDMA. The trend is hard to counter, due to the difficulty of cracking down on the precursor chemicals used to manufacture these narcotics. Many chemicals used to make synthetic drugs have common pharmaceutical or industrial uses, making it all but impossible for law enforcement to prevent their illict use. Even when chemicals intended for drug production are seized, their often volatile nature makes them difficult to dispose of safely , providing police with an incentive to sell them on the black market.

"Homeless People Abused to Smuggle Cell Phones in Costa Rica Jails. A group that used homeless people to smuggle cell phones and drugs into Costa Rican prisons is under investigation, the second time such a ring has been exposed in two months. The group recruited homeless men and women off the streets of San Jose and then forced them to visit prisons with the items hidden in their rectums or vaginas, reported La Nacion. Behind the ring were a brother and sister, who were arrested along with two other people and charged with human trafficking after a September 20 police raid. The traffickers gave the homeless people baths, new clothes and food, and then sent them to the prisons. It's unclear how long the group was in operation, but in late August, police arrested two men and a woman who attacked a man outside the Luis Paulino Mora prison in Alajuela. The man told police that the assault occurred after he refused to smuggle a cell phone into the prison. He left the visitors line twice until finally alerting authorities to the scheme. Cell phone smuggling by gangs and their accomplices is rampant in Costa Rica's prisons, and the abuse suffered by the homeless men and women is another example of vulnerable populations being exploited in the service of organized crime. Criminal groups pay between $100 and $700 to obtain the smuggled phones, which can be sold to inmates for as much as $1,400, according to La Nacion. The inmates then often use the cell phones to continue their extortion rackets and drug trafficking operations outside prison walls. The black market trade ""moves a lot of money,"" Pablo Bertozzi, Costa Rica's prison director, told La Nacion in June of 2018. Some 10,014 phones were confiscated in Costa Rican prisons between 2015 and 2018, but that amount represents only a portion of the phones circulating in the jails, according to authorities. Part of the problem is that punishments are minimal for cell phone smuggling, and most people caught only receive small fines or even just warnings. This only fuels the trade and may even give smugglers more of an incentive to take risks -- such as with abusing homeless men and women. What's more, criminal groups have long taken advantage of at-risk populations. Human traffickers target impoverished girls and women for sex trafficking or to act as drug mules ; cartels in Mexico recruit adolescents ; and Venezuelan migrants in Colombia are used to pick coca leaves and for work as prostitutes.

"Baseballs Yasiel Puig Case May Expose Criminal Profits from US Sport. The tale of a runaway Cuban baseball player illustrates a human smuggling route from the Communist island to the US, and how Mexico's brutal Zetas may profit from the trade. According to the expose by LA Magazine , LA Dodgers star Yasiel Puig travelled to the United States via Mexico in 2012 with the help of Cuban-Americans and a human smuggling ring with ties to Los Zetas. The investigation reported that Miami-based Cuban-American Raul Pacheco financed the deal as part of an agreement with Puig entitling him to 20 percent of the sportsman's future Major League Baseball (MLB) contracts. The smugglers reportedly paid a criminal tax -- known as ""piso"" -- to the Zetas to operate. According to the investigation, the smuggling route is a common one for Cuban emigre sportspeople seeking more lucrative negotiations with US sports teams as ""free agents,"" as opposed to arriving to the United States and being picked by a team as an amateur. After staying on an island off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula for a month while his smugglers haggled with Pacheco over the price, Puig was transport to Mexico City where he was assessed by a Dodgers scout and offered a $42 million 7-year contract -- the largest ever offered to a runaway Cuban baseball player. While subsequent reports have offered conflicting accounts of the Zetas' involvement in Puig's journey -- with Excelsior even claiming the Zetas had taken over human smuggling routes previously run by the ""Cuban-American Mafia"" -- the connection seems a simple case of the Zetas taxing profits for criminal activity in areas under their control -- a classic element of the group's modus operandi based around territorial control and criminal franchising. Yet regardless of the level of the Zetas involvement, the case highlights how MLB regulations can encourage human smuggling that funds a violent cartel responsible for massive drug consignments entering the United States. As the investigation points out, MLB teams work in a legal gray area, with the Cuban's required to ""establish residency"" in a third country before entering negotiations -- something that Puig is unlikely to have done in the short time he spent in Mexico. With teams sending scouts to negotiate contracts in Mexico, and therefore tacitly complicit in this trade, it raises the question of whether Puig's case will serve as a wakeup call for MLB chiefs. But with a long line of similar cases involving Cuban baseball players , and the MLB's history of inadequate action in the case of other controversial practices, it may fall to a higher authority to institute the type of change necessary to put an end to this trade."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Could Ecuador See Rise of a Home-Grown Rebel Insurgency?A clandestine leftist organization has claimed responsibility for two bombings in Ecuador's largest city, sparking concerns about a nascent insurgency in the South American country. On November 22, two separate bombs exploded nearly simultaneously in downtown Guayaquil , the first of which went off in front of the local Ministry of Health offices, while the second detonated several blocks away. While no one was seriously injured in either incident, the second explosion sent dozens of leaflets flying through the air, all of which bore a call to arms against the center-left government of President Rafael Correa. The flyers were titled ""The Right to Work is Guaranteed by the Constitution and We Will Defend it Through Blood and Fire,"" and issued a scathing critique of President Correa's recent decision to fire thousands of doctors and other public health professionals to rein in federal spending. Calling on the youths of Ecuador to ""join the ranks of the militias and people's army in order to rid ourselves once and for all of the rightist mafia known as Alianza Pais [Correa's political party],"" the statement was signed by a group calling itself the Armed Revolutionary Insurgent Forces of Ecuador (FAIRE). The appearance of a leftist insurgency is unusual for Ecuador, which, unlike neighboring Peru and Colombia, has been free of large-scale insurgent groups for most of its history. The most notable left-wing rebel group in Ecuador's past was a small urban guerrilla front known as the Eloy Alfaro Popular Armed Forces. Named after an early 20th century revolutionary, the guerrillas carried out a series of kidnappings and bank robberies in the mid to late 1980s, but were swiftly dismantled by security forces. By 1989, the group's remaining members had agreed to lay down their arms. Since then, several small-scale rebel groups have emerged in the country, such as the Red Sun Communist Party of Ecuador , the Group of Popular Combatants , the Alfarist Liberation Army , and the Guerrilla Coordinator of Ecuador. However, none of these have been able to mobilize mass support, and do not pose a significant threat to the Ecuadorean government. It is unclear if any links exist between these groups and the FAIRE, but police claim that the November 22 bombings were first they had heard of the group, suggesting that it may be an entirely new force. The real security threat does not lie in potential in collusion between these groups, however, but on the northern border with Colombia, where the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) are known to operate. As InSight Crime has documented , the FARC's presence in Ecuador was an open secret for years, and Ecuadorean security forces, like their Venezuelan counterparts, seemed to turn a blind eye to FARC activity in the border region. This changed in March 2008, when the Colombian air force bombed a FARC camp located in Ecuadorean territory, killing Luis Edgar Devia Silva , alias ""Raul Reyes."" Although the attack caused Ecuador to shut off diplomatic relations with Colombia for two years, it also brought unprecedented international attention to the FARC's activities in Ecuador. This, combined with the fact that Correa himself has been accused of accepting donations from the FARC for his latest presidential campaign, has prompted the Ecuadorean government to crack down on the rebels. With the loss of Ecuador's tacit support, the FARC have also lost an incentive not to conduct operations on Ecuadorean soil, meaning that they could potentially be a valuable ally to nascent guerrilla groups such as the FAIRE. While it is hard to see what the FARC would gain by supporting Ecuadorean insurgents, Colombian intelligence officials allege that such international cooperation has already been documented, most notably between the FARC and Peru's Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso). Because support from the FARC would almost certainly mean unwanted attention to the Colombians' camps along the border, the FAIRE would likely have to become far more influential for the FARC to want to collaborate with them. The FAIRE would have to develop a much larger support base, and likely expand their operations beyond mere bombings, to include confrontations with security forces. Ultimately, the group is a long way from this, and if their luck resembles that of the other small insurgencies in Ecuador, they'll be taken down long before they become such a threat.

"Can Drug Regulation Help Tackle Organized Crime?A recent report argues that regulating illegal drugs can help governments tackle organized crime, adding to a growing number of voices calling for the decriminalization of personal drug use. But can this momentum turn into real change? The report , by the Global Commission on Drugs, advances the idea that the illegal drug trade only benefits transnational criminal groups while the countries in which they operate suffer the consequences. The report's authors argue that criminal organizations take advantage of drug prohibition as they control, and profit from, every aspect of the production and distribution chain. ""Every region in the world suffers: from violence induced by turf wars over production areas and transit routes, from corruption and connivance of state institutions, and from laundering of drug money, which damages the legal economy,"" Ruth Dreifuss, chair of the group and former president of Switzerland, said in the report. The report's authors propose decriminalizing and regulating illegal drugs, using the approach currently seen with alcohol and tobacco. This includes, for example, banning consumption for minors, imposing high taxes and investing in public health campaigns to discourage consumption. The commission is made up of a panel of world leaders and intellectuals, including several former Latin American presidents, such as Ricardo Lagos of Chile, Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, among others. The suggestion that regulating drugs can help tackle organized crime is not new, but it is gaining momentum in Latin America, particularly with the recent legalization of marijuana in Canada and Uruguay. ""I think there has been progress. Ten years ago, the debate over drug regulation was a very difficult one. Today, we can at least talk about the issue,"" Ricardo Lagos, a former Chilean president and a member of the Global Commission on Drugs, told InSight Crime. The debate over drug regulation comes after hard-hitting strategies have failed in countries such as Colombia and Mexico, which are also at the center of the drug trade. Coca cultivation in Colombia is currently at an all-time high, while violence in Mexico has reached unprecedented levels. Those arguing for drug regulation are pushing to treat illegal drugs as other harmful substances like tobacco and alcohol. This, they say, would immediately cut criminal organizations' profits. Governments could then tackle addiction through rehabilitation programs and offset the costs with new tax strategies. Decriminalizing drugs would not immediately wipe out all criminal organizations, which have diverse criminal portfolios and are likely to move into other illegal economies. But this would be a positive first step, though governments would also need an effective strategy to tackle money laundering and corruption. Latin America is still a long way from full-scale drug legalization , such as that seen in Portugal, or even debating the regulation of so-called ""hard-drugs,"" such as cocaine. But experiments with marijuana legalization in Uruguay and, more recently, in Canada, provide some clues on how it could work. Experts at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) think tank and the Brookings Institution reported on the status of marijuana legalization in Uruguay nearly a year after it went into effect in 2013. They identified a number of challenges in the early implementation of the law, including the system's ability to meet demand and issues posed by the fact that US banks cannot do businesses with companies involved in the sale or distribution of a controlled substance, including marijuana. But experts said that the future of the industry is still positive, as most of these issues can likely be overcome by policy changes and continued education and experience. But a number of world leaders are against any form of drug decriminalization. Ahead of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2018, US President Donald Trump urged all nations to sign a pledge to combat the drug trade through ""a four-pronged strategy."" That strategy, which did not tackle proposals for regulation, focused on reducing drug demand, boosting treatment for drug abuse, deepening multinational law enforcement cooperation and reducing drug supplies. The pledge was an unusual move given that the United Nations' drug policy is typically decided by deliberation and consensus. Colombia was one of the countries to support the plan. President Ivan Duque recently banned the personal use of small amounts of cocaine and marijuana. On Oct. 1, he signed a decree that authorizes the police to search people and confiscate any quantity of drugs they have on them. The order invalidated a ruling from the Constitutional Court that gave people the right to carry small doses of drugs for personal use. Despite the challenges, former President Lagos remains positive and believes the key to tackling criminal organizations is to achieve a regional consensus to regulate personal drug consumption. ""It is not enough for legislators to pass laws,"" he said. ""It is essential for society to discuss these important issues and to understand that this is not an issue that can be resolved at the national level, it needs an international approach""."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"The Connected Black Market: How the Dark Web Has Empowered LatAm Organized Crime. The global proliferation of internet access has transformed societies, enabling online and financial inclusion in the developing world. But it has also empowered organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean, international officials warn. With 43 percent of the world's online community, Latin America and the Caribbean -- home to some of the world's most dominant criminal networks -- has become even more vital to transnational crime, said Amado Philip de Andres, the representative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Central America and the Caribbean. De Andres cited the emergence of the "" internet of things "" -- a term used to describe the web-enablement of mobile devices, consumer appliances, vehicles and infrastructure -- as one trend reshaping how criminal networks operate. Research firm Gartner projects that the global number of connected devices will grow from 8.4 billion this year to 20 billion by 2020. Criminal syndicates in Latin American and the Caribbean are exploiting the democratization of web access, de Andres said. User connectivity has surged by 1,300 percent over the last 10 years. And with falling smartphone prices , the UN expects mobile supply in the region to reach two billion by 2018. Crime as a Service Smartphone proliferation has jumpstarted the regional "" crime as a service "" economy, an amorphous online marketplace where criminals can purchase ready-made digital tools or services that help them carry out sophisticated criminal activities. De Andres said crime as a service in Latin America and the Caribbean has expanded fivefold in the last three and a half years, fomenting a symbiotic cyber crime ecosystem where diverse criminal markets come together, with each sector supporting the others. In addition to making the digital underworld more accessible to criminals, the growing ubiquity of mobile devices creates more potential targets from which to steal sensitive data like bank and credit card information. Brazil is the regional leader for banking malware infections, where malicious email campaigns dupe people into clicking corrupt website links that steal their login and financial data, according to cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks. Fueled by the growing crime as a service economy, the annual cost of cyber crime in all Latin American and Caribbean nations has grown to $90 billion a year, according to a 2016 Inter-American Development Bank cybersecurity report. De Andres told InSight Crime that existing crime groups have begun to take advantage of the crime as a service industry. ""Based on current investigations linking drug trafficking cartels and transnational organized crime networks, one could reckon that traditional organized crime groups are beginning to use the service-based cyber crime market and are therefore buying access to technical skills,"" he said. In some cases, drug cartels have even physically abducted or recruited cyber crime talent. For example, Mexico's Zetas and Gulf Cartel crime groups have both been accused of the 2013 kidnapping of telecommunications engineer Felipe Perez. Rumors persist that Perez was forced into a ""shadow hacker brigade"" to build one of the cartels' hidden radio networks. And in 2016, now-captured Sinaloa Cartel capo Damaso Lopez Nunez reportedly enlisted a hacker to wage a social media propaganda campaign against the ""Chapitos"" -- the sons of extradited kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman -- as he battled the kingpin's children for control of the organization. The expansion of the internet of things in Latin America adds to concerns about the crime as a service industry not only because these devices often contain weakly-protected personal information, but also due to the fact that all connected devices can be coerced into botnets, vast networks of infected computers that hackers use to conduct distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which can shut down websites and online industrial control systems by overloading them with traffic. In fact, a 2015 report by communications firm Level 3 Communications found that Latin America accounted for 12 percent of the world's DDoS events. Furthermore, DDoS attacks and other breaches can have a direct impact on drug interdiction efforts. US law enforcement agencies have reported Mexican drug trafficking organizations hacking their border surveillance drones, and "" spoofing "" them with misleading GPS coordinates. The Dark Web But overwhelmingly, it is the dark web , a collection of thousands of websites that can only be accessed with special browser software, which has become the nexus for the global crime as a service market. Using Amazon-like sites on the dark web like the now-shuttered Silk Road , AlphaBay and Playpen , criminals, hackers, rogue nation-state actors, terrorists and child pornographers are forming increasingly interconnected networks and furthering what some have called "" deviant globalization ."" In Latin America and the Caribbean, de Andres said, cartels are exploring the dark web to locate buyers for large-scale cocaine shipments, while Central American gangs have used these sites to advertise their willingness to help with cross-border trafficking. Other regional drug traffickers reportedly use underground web forums to source synthetic opioids from Asia. But dark web commodities reach far beyond narcotics. For instance, the international child pornography investigation that led to the closure of Playpen netted arrests in Chile and Peru. And Mexico has become a world "" leader "" in this illegal industry, with some major international investigations exposing the dark web's role in the furtherance of these crimes. Invisible Transactions De Andres said the dark web enables criminals to exploit three legitimate features of the modern internet: anonymization, encryption and virtual currencies. The latter has revolutionized money laundering and made cyber-enabled financial crime a top enforcement priority for investigators. Organized crime groups are now using centralized virtual currencies like WebMoney and Perfect Money or decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to better cover their financial footprints. Latin America and the Caribbean was home to the first major international virtual currency laundering scandal: the US government's takedown of underworld cyber banking system Liberty Reserve in 2013. Before its closure, authorities said the service laundered $6 billion worth of illicit transactions tied to drug trafficking, investment fraud, credit card fraud, data theft and child pornography. To further confound law enforcement, Latin American criminal organizations are employing ""money-mule"" networks, which structure virtual and conventional transactions into smaller and more innocuous-looking sums. De Andres said each mule receives a commission of between 3 and 5 percent per transaction. Crime syndicates are also using legitimate online shopping sites, where legal goods and services are sold, as well as mobile internet payment systems like Remitly, Transferwise and Xoom to structure payments. In Latin America, where market research firm Forrester projects e-commerce sales to reach $42 billion by 2021, de Andres said that crime groups are often laundering dirty money through fictitious airline and hotel websites in so-called transaction laundering schemes. De Andres also said he expects the dark web retail economy to grow parallel to legitimate e-commerce over the next seven to ten years. Dovetailing with increased e-commerce transactions in the region is the inevitable rise of payment fraud, through ""card not present"" transactions, where criminals use stolen payment card information to obtain goods online, as well as chargeback schemes, which entail fraudulent disputes over purchases. These schemes are generating billions in losses for online merchants and card issuers, according to a 2016 study by credit card trade publication The Nilson Report. De Andres said that 60 percent of all payment fraud in Central America and the Caribbean is due to card not present transactions. And according to market analytics firm Juniper Research , Brazil and Mexico, two of Latin America's most significant economies, had the highest 2016 chargeback fraud rates in the world at 3.5 percent and 2.75 percent, respectively. Terrorist Influence? In addition to the above-mentioned issues, de Andres put particular emphasis on links between South American criminal networks and Islamic terrorist organizations. Although concerns about Islamic terrorism in Latin America have often been overinflated for political reasons, the dark web offers an easy path for terror groups to launch attacks in a part of the world where they have traditionally had little physical presence. Citing online recruitment of would-be fighters in Trinidad and Tobago by the Islamic State, de Andres envisions potential threats involving terrorists urging followers in Latin America and the Caribbean to launch attacks against critical infrastructure with military grade cyber exploits sold on the dark web. De Andres also pointed to the use of the dark web to coordinate transatlantic drug exports, which he said are shipped through the Central American and Caribbean corridors to reach West Africa. From West Africa, terrorist groups like Boko Haram transport South American drugs through the Sahara and into Europe, using the proceeds to fund terrorist activities. Additionally, transnational money laundering has at times brought crime groups into contact with terrorist organizations. For example, US prosecutors alleged that a suspected operative for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah used encrypted communications to coordinate money laundering activities for Colombia's Oficina de Envigado crime group. Addressing the Threats To address the rising cyber threat environment, the UNODC recommends a four-point approach rooted in ""prevention, partnerships, protection and investigation."" The first step in this strategy is for regional governments to raise awareness and invest in resources to properly train cyber crime investigators. De Andres cited the UNODC's initiative to train police in El Salvador on investigating cyber crime as one good model for a preventative strategy. Secondly, de Andres highlighted the need for greater coordination between Latin American governments and other nations, in order to promote better intelligence sharing and the ""harmonization of legislation."" The latter specifically entails the drafting of multilateral mutual assistance agreements and extradition treaties that enable more effective enforcement regimes for prosecuting cyber crime. He also advises partner governments in Latin America and the Caribbean to create regional cyber crime centers that act as continental hubs for intelligence sharing. Thirdly, de Andres said regional governments need to draft domestic laws that more accurately reflect evolving cyber crime typologies and their intersection with transnational organized crime. A sound protective strategy also requires investing in better network security resources and exploring new avenues to protect internet of things devices and critical infrastructure like oil pipelines, power plants and water treatment facilities. The latter is imperative as a 2015 report authored by German information security firm Trend Micro and the Organization for American States, a regional non-government entity, found that only 21 percent of organizations participate in dialogue with governments about the cyber resilience of their critical infrastructures. Finally, de Andres called for an intelligence-based approach, highlighting the work of the Central American and Caribbean Council of Public Prosecutors, which brings together skilled organized crime prosecutors with those experienced in cyber crime investigations to collaborate across jurisdictions."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Mass Online Theft in Brazil Sheds Light on Scale of Cybercrime. The discovery of a cyber crime operation in Brazil that may have stolen billions of dollars from Internet users is likely the largest electronic theft ever reported, illustrating the immense scale of this growing criminal activity. The scam -- which was uncovered by RSA Security, part of the information technology company EMC Corporation -- targeted up to an estimated $3.9 billion in online transactions, reported Reuters. It is unclear what portion was successfully stolen by the alleged criminals, but according to The New York Times even half the targeted value would make this the largest electronic theft on record. The criminals allegedly targeted transactions made via Boleto Bancario -- a popular online payment method in Brazil -- by infecting computers with malware, reported IG Sao Paulo. The malware entered computers via e-mails and redirected money from online transactions to bank accounts controlled by cyber criminals. According to RSA Security, the criminals are still active and may have started operating in late 2012. So far 192,227 people and 495,793 transactions have been affected. Cyber crime is growing quickly in Latin America , which is an attractive region for cyber criminals due to weaker electronic security measures and a growing number of Internet users. Brazil has been one of the region's hardest-hit countries, along with Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. According to a report published by RSA Security ( pdf ), Brazil was tenth in the world and second in Latin America for estimated losses from phishing -- stealing financial or personal information online -- which cost the country an estimated $86 million in 2013. The growing popularity of online banking and electronic commerce and an estimated 107 million internet users -- more than half the country's population -- have made Brazil especially vulnerable to cyber crime. According to the Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban), electronic crime costs the country around $700 million a year. In response to the growing threat, Brazil implemented a new law in April 2013, which designated cyber crime as a criminal offense punishable by up to two years in prison. The law has been criticized for being too lenient, however, and some experts have warned that without greater regional cooperation, cyber criminals will simply target internet users in other countries.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Cyber Crime in Colombia: An Underestimated Threat?Cyber crime costs Colombia's economy hundreds of millions of dollars and affects up to six million Colombians every year, according to some estimates. How can the government combat this rapidly evolving threat? A booming technology market of smartphones and portable devices and a rapidly rising number of Colombian internet users -- currently over 9.5 million, up two million from last year, according to government statistics -- has opened the doors for criminal organizations, fraudsters, and opportunists to cash in on a profitable and difficult to trace form of crime. There are many ways in which criminal groups and individuals engage in and profit from cyber crime. Aside from straight theft, cyber crime can involve activities such as creating websites for child pornography or to lure people into forced labor and sex slavery, and virtually ""kidnapping"" external computers to demand a ransom payment from the user in order to regain access to their personal information. According to Andres Guzman, the head of leading Colombian IT security firm Adalid, the definition of cyber crime is so broad it can even include sending extortion emails and communicating for criminal purposes. However the most common form seen in Colombia, according to Guzman, is online information theft, or ""phishing,"" by which criminals steal sensitive personal data, usually in order to take money from the victims' bank accounts -- a crime he says has cost some of his clients $1 million. Colombia currently ranks as the worst country in Latin America and eighth in the world for phishing, according to a recent report by the EMC Corporation's security service (RSA) ( pdf ). The study revealed that in 2013, 43 percent of all phishing in the region took place in Colombia, causing losses of $95 million. According to a 2013 report on fraud in Colombia by KPMG ( pdf ), criminal groups are currently responsible for around 17 percent of cyber crimes in Colombia, while the majority -- 61 percent -- are committed by employees, either working with outsiders, colleagues or on their own. According to Guzman, the percentage of crimes involving complicit employees is even higher -- his figures indicate that 87 percent of all internet thefts within a company involve the passive or active complicity of internal employees. This can range from criminal groups bribing the cleaner for inside information or to plant dirty USBs, to intimidating workers into leaving a virtual backdoor for intruders to enter the company's system. While arrest rates remain low compared to the number of crimes committed, they are at least rising. According to a June 2014 report by the Organization of American States (OAS) ( pdf ), the National Police captured 422 cyber criminals in 2013, up from 323 in 2012 and 252 in 2011. Meanwhile, the Police Cyber Center unit (CCP) responded to just over 1,600 cyber attacks. Playing Cyber Catch Up Colombia has taken some steps to combat cyber crime. In 2009, Congress passed a new law that created and defined criminal offenses specific to cyber crime. However, Alexander Diaz Garcia, a new technology specialist and state judge who helped draft the law, told InSight Crime that persuading politicians of the necessity of the reforms was no easy task, and that serious challenges remained in improving the capacity of the authorities to take action. ""The importance of implementing policies has been underestimated,"" he said, pointing to a lack of appropriate training for security forces and the judiciary. Nevertheless, according to Diaz, Colombia has won international plaudits for its anti-cyber crime policies, and in some respects is a regional leader. In 2011, it became the first Latin American nation to form a national cyber-security strategy, creating a series of specialized government, police and military forces. However, Guzman says the strides Colombia has taken are nowhere near enough to halt the advance of a rapidly evolving criminal sector. ""Technology advances much faster than the law,"" he said. ""By the time they learn to stop a trend, the criminals have come out with another one."" In the latest response to the threat of cyber crime, President Juan Manuel Santos requested that the OAS send a technical mission of international experts to Colombia to help the country develop a new cyber defense strategy. The report's main recommendations highlight institutional failings on the most fundamental levels -- the OAS called for a clear and coordinated ""vision"" of the country's cyber security strategy, legal reforms, improved coordination and training in the security forces and improved cooperation both between countries and between the public and private sectors. Following the issuing of these recommendations, the government has announced new plans to combat cyber crime, including the creation of a Digital Committee and a National Cyber Security Agency. These new entities will be responsible for coordinating public and private strategies to combat cyber crime, as well as strengthening the pre-existing offices dedicated to this form of criminal activity. Specialized public prosecutors' offices will also be created to deal with cyber crime, reported El Tiempo. While Colombia is showing significant motivation to move against cyber crime, the question remains of whether this will be enough. The price of failing to properly implement the sort of coordinated and integrated strategy called for by the OAS could be high. ""That's the capital of all businesses -- information,"" Diaz said. ""And if isn't taken care of, the consequences will be disastrous."""	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Infiltration of Chile Air Force Emails Highlights LatAm Cyber Threats. A group of hackers from Peru has infiltrated email accounts from Chile's Air Force containing sensitive information on strategic weapons, underscoring Latin Amercia's vulnerability to cyber crime. On August 14, the Chilean Air Force (FACH) confirmed that two of its institutional email accounts had been infiltrated, days after Peruvian hacker group Lulz Security Peru took responsibility for the attack on its Twitter account (see below), reported El Mostrador. The FACH told El Mostrador the institution first noticed the breach in May 2013 and took immediate security measures. Although the FACH claimed the information in the emails did not pose a risk to national security, El Mostrador reported that one of the infiltrated accounts belonged to the logistical command's Department of Contract Administration and contained information on negotiations with various international defense companies. Emails between the FACH and an Israeli defense company, for example, revealed information on strategic weapons as well as improvements made on a fleet of F-16 fighter planes. Lulz Security Peru stated in a message that the cyber attack was revenge for a 2009 incident in which Chilean hackers posted a painting depicting the War of the Pacific -- which the two countries fought in the late 1800s -- on a Peruvian government website. Hoy esten al tanto Leak de correos de la FUERZA AEREA DE . contratos militares secretos, comunicaciones, inteligencia. by LulzSecPeru -- Lulz Security Peru (LulzSecPeru) August 6, 2014 The public report of this cyber attack comes amid growing concern about the region's vulnerability to cyber crime. Last week, the Police Community of the Americas (Ameripol) announced the creation of a regional cyber security center to evaluate threats and provide support to law enforcement bodies. Several Latin American countries have also recently updated their criminal codes or created special security units to address this issue. The FACH is far from the only Chilean government institution to fall prey to cyber attacks. According to the website Zone-H -- which reports on hackers -- Lulz Security Peru has also attacked the websites of Chile's Justice Ministry and the Army's Non-Commissioned Officer School. Additionally, the hacker group ""Anonymous"" has infiltrated Chile's national library and Ministry of Education websites , as well as the website of Colombia's former intelligence agency and the Facebook page of Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. These cyber attacks highlight the potential political and security concerns hacking presents, but many cyber criminals have financial motives. In 2013, Colombia and Brazil were among the top 10 countries in the world for economic losses from phishing -- the online theft of financial or personal information -- which cost both countries close to one hundred million dollars ( pdf ). Meanwhile, a cyber crime scheme discovered in Brazil in July this year targeted around $3.9 billion in online transactions and is believed to be the largest electronic theft case ever reported."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Kidnap Cyber Crime Techniques Spread to Bolivia. Authorities in Bolivia have arrested a group of kidnappers that hacked computers to gain information on victims and demanded exorbitant ransoms, an unusual case in a country not known for kidnapping or cyber crime. The special investigative unit (CEIP) of the Bolivian police arrested four people in La Paz accused of kidnapping at least 17 people and demanding individual ransoms of up to $200,000 from victim's families, reported La Razon. The arrests follow three months of police investigation into the group. Police commander General Walter Villarpando said the group would plan the kidnappings for at least two weeks, investigating each victim and their assets with the help of a computer hacker. Following the kidnapping, they would call the victim's family, identify themselves as working for Colombian hitmen, and demand payment. The ring's leader, an evangelical pastor, said during questioning the group had been robbing the rich to give to the poor, despite only the kidnappers' families receiving money. Authorities said that while no victims were injured, most did not report the crime for fear of reprisals. While kidnapping is a common crime in other Latin American nations -- especially Venezuela and Mexico -- it is not a major problem in Bolivia, although other cases have been reported in the past year. This case is also notable for two other reasons: first, the amount of money demanded, which was extremely high -- in comparison, one Mexican group dismantled in 2011 charged under $4,000; second, for the use of technology to aid the crime. Using social media or hacking software to gain information on kidnap victims is a common facet of cyber crime and its use in this case indicates the operation was somewhat sophisticated. The Andean nation, like others in Latin America, is ill-equipped to deal with cyber crime , having no specific legal framework to criminalize and punish it, and even shutting down the security forces Computer Crimes Division in 2008, according to Global Information Society Watch , an NGO that monitors cyber security around the world.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Mexico Cyber Criminals Kidnapping Business Computer Systems. Hackers in Mexico have found a profitable illicit enterprise in extorting businesses by hijacking computer systems, another dimension in the country's large and growing cyber crime industry. Speaking at a security conference in Mexico City, the head of Mexico's Scientific Police Division, Ciro Humberto Ortiz Estrada, described how hackers remotely ""kidnap"" the computer systems and databases of businesses, reported La Jornada. The criminals then demand payment -- usually between $2,000 and $3,000 -- for the user to regain access to the system. The individual or company is normally forced to pay by electronic transfer into national or foreign bank accounts. Small and medium sized businesses are the most vulnerable to these attacks, as they often do not have the sophisticated protection systems of larger companies, according to Ortiz. Ortiz warned cyber crime in Mexico was growing rapidly: while criminals made an estimated $2 billion from cyber crime in 2012, this increased to $3 billion in 2013, he said. Over the course of 2013, Mexico's Federal Police registered 23,543 cyber crime cases. Mexico's high internet connectivity and abundance of criminal groups have made it a growing hub for cyber crime -- which more commonly takes the form of hacking, scams, fraud and theft. Reports of cyber extortion in Mexico are not new, with a 2011 McAfee survey of electricity infrastructure executives revealing that up to 80 percent of Mexican participants had been subject to cyber extortion. However, the extortion reported by McAfee was principally based on threatening to bring down networks with distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS). The strategy of holding systems for ransom described by Ortiz suggests the crime is evolving. Elsewhere in the region, less sophisticated forms of extortion that make use of the internet are also taking hold. In Colombia, for example, extortionists track down personal data online and use it to blackmail victims. Mexico is now taking steps to address the problem of cyber crime. In 2012, the country created the National Cyber Incident Response Center (CERT-MX) , and according to Ortiz, the federal government is currently evaluating a legal reform that will establish penalties for specific cyber crimes. However, as illustrated by the latest reported extortion techniques, the challenge is not limited to establishing new judicial and institutional mechanisms for tackling cyber crime, but also involves keeping up with a rapidly evolving criminal sector."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Microsoft Opens Anti-Cyber Crime Office in Colombia. Technology giant Microsoft has selected Colombia's capital Bogota as its outpost in Latin America, as part of a network of offices across the globe which will collaborate with regional authorities to address cyber crime. Announcing its new Cybercrime Center in Redmond , Washington, on November 14, Microsoft identified 12 locations across the globe for satellite offices and regional laboratories, including five in Europe, four in Asia, one in Australia and one in Washington DC. According to El Espectador , there are six million annual victims of cyber crime in Colombia and the new Microsoft office will liaise with authorities on matters of ""information regarding vulnerability and viruses,"" according to the company's Latin America Director for Cybercrime Andres Rengifo, although he guaranteed that would not involve passing on personal details. The new global scheme will bring together security engineers, digital forensics experts and lawyers specialized in cyber crime, and will combine massive data gathering and analysis, traditional detective work, high-level diplomacy and legal action, reported Reuters. Microsoft software will create maps of online criminal networks and gather intelligence on cyber threats obtained through operations to destroy botnets -- collections of programs that communicate with each other to send spam or flood the bandwidth of a targeted system. Another program, PhotoDNA, is used to prevent child pornography by turning images into hash values that are very hard to alter. Organized crime has never been slow to adapt, and as technology has advanced Latin American criminal groups have learnt to harness it for their purposes in increasingly imaginative ways, outpacing law enforcement. InSight Crime has reported on the use of the internet to promote criminal activities and offer services, make graphic threats and gather information on new recruits or kidnap victims. Cyber crime has become a major problem across the continent, with over half of companies in the region reporting some sort of cyber attack in 2012, according to internet security firm ESET. Earlier this year, Mexico was identified as one of the top ten countries in the world for identity theft, while a study by computer security firm Norton reported that cyber crime now costs $3 billion each year in Mexico alone -- almost double what it cost in 2011. State institutions have been targeted for cyber-attacks in recent years, including in Mexico , Brazil and Guatemala. Latin American governments have been criticized for failing to keep up with the technology used by organized crime, making the Colombia Microsoft office a very positive step."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Peru Makes Largest-Ever Bust of Counterfeit Dollars. A recent operation by police in Peru led to the largest seizure of counterfeit dollars in the country's history, illustrating the sophistication and scale of the counterfeiting industry in the Andean nation infamous for its production of fake bills. The Peruvian Interior Ministry announced on November 16 the seizure of $30 million worth of counterfeit US currency, 50,000 euros worth of fake bills and a yet-undetermined quantity of counterfeit Peruvian soles. Authorities also confiscated nine printing machines as well as other equipment used in the production of the counterfeit currency. In addition, 49 individuals, including several Ecuadoran citizens, were arrested in several cities during what the government described as the largest counterfeit money bust in Peru's history. Authorities said the suspects were part of a ""powerful network that dispatched huge amounts of false money out of Peru"" by various methods. Although the network mainly sent the fake money to the United States, the Interior Ministry said the suspects also had connections in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and countries in the European Union. The US agency in charge of combating currency counterfeiting, the Secret Service, announced in 2013 that Peru had overtaken Colombia as the world's biggest producer of counterfeit dollars. In the ten years prior to that announcement, some $103 million worth of seized fake US currency had reportedly been traced back to Peru, a figure which has undoubtedly increased in recent years. The head of Peru's anti-fraud police division Walter Escalante told The Guardian earlier this year that his unit had seized around ""about $75 million in fake bills"" since 2009. But as the news outlet pointed out, this figure almost certainly does not reflect the true scale of Peru's currency counterfeiting industry. In conversations with The Guardian, a ""veteran counterfeiter"" said that a single clandestine lab could produce an average of $3 to $5 million every week, yielding an annual production of around $150 million. According to police information cited by the newspaper, at least four such sophisticated labs were operating just in the capital city of Lima. Experts often point to the high quality of the counterfeit currency produced in Peru to explain the country's leading role in this illicit industry. Unlike their Colombian counterparts who heavily relied on older techniques, Peruvian counterfeiters make extensive use of digital technology and often touch up the fake bills by hand to ensure their believability. Additionally, as InSight Crime previously pointed out , economic variables like the dollar's rising value and high inflation in nearby Venezuela can contribute to increased demand for counterfeit money. Another significant factor may be the substantial return on investment due to relatively cheap materials and labor needed to run counterfeiting operation. The Guardian reported that counterfeiters usually charge customers around 20 percent of the bill's face value. Using a rough calculation, this means a single lab could earn up to $1 million per week by producing $5 million worth of fake bills. But even using more conservative estimates, a Peruvian police officer told El Pais that currency counterfeiting was more profitable than drug trafficking. The profits from currency counterfeiting are typically divided between the two separate parts of the operation, namely the clandestine labs which print the product and the networks that then ship the fake bills outside of the country."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Rising Dollar, Venezuela Crisis Fuel Colombias Counterfeit Currency Trade. Colombian authorities say the rising value of the US dollar combined with the economic crisis in neighboring Venezuela has increased the profitability of the counterfeit currency trade, shifting the dynamics of the market and attracting new players to the business. Officials consulted by El Tiempo pointed to the rising value of real US dollars as one of the main drivers of this trend. A year ago, a dollar cost just over 2,000 Colombian pesos in the legitimate market, according to the World Bank. Today, a legitimate dollar costs more than 3,300 pesos, according to the currency conversion website XE.com. While the value of real dollars has increased, the cost of producing fake ones has remained relatively stable, making the process significantly more lucrative for fraudsters. Colombian police sources told El Tiempo that a fake $100 bill, which would have sold for between 8,000 and 10,000 pesos (between $2.40 and $3.00) a year ago, now sells for between 15,000 and 20,000 pesos (between $4.50 and $6.00). El Tiempo's sources also indicated that Colombian counterfeiters are taking advantage of the ongoing economic crisis in Venezuela, where the black market for dollars has grown rapidly as the local currency, the bolivar, has plummeted in value. In addition to counterfeiting, El Tiempo reported that other types of currency fraud have also begun to resurface in Colombia -- for example, the "" Nigerian dollar "" scam, which involves swindlers selling ink-stained false bills and instructing their victims to buy a bogus ""cleaning solution"" from a confederate. Julian Quintana, the director of the Technical Investigative Unit of the Colombian Attorney General's office, expressed concern that the increasing profitability of counterfeiting had led to a reactivation of previously defunct criminal networks, some of which might have been partially displaced to nearby countries like Peru, Ecuador and Argentina by prior enforcement actions. The increasing demand for counterfeit dollars in Colombia and Venezuela has not only contributed to the growing profitability of the trade, but also to a shift in the dynamics of the market. Previously, fake bills were often created with the intention of distributing them abroad, where they could be sold at much higher prices. But El Tiempo's sources said that more false dollars are beginning to circulate in Colombia as citizens increasingly use them for purchasing imports or as spending money for vacations in North America. Moreover, Colombian investigators said they have observed a decline in counterfeiting of currencies other than the US dollar, such as the European Union's euro and the Colombian peso. In 2013, the US central bank implemented new anti-counterfeiting features on the $100 bill, which is the US currency note most frequently forged outside the United States. However, bills without the new security measures can still be used as legal tender, complicating efforts to detect falsifications. And, as InSight Crime has previously reported , counterfeiters around the region have developed sophisticated techniques for producing convincing forgeries at a prolific pace. Peru has become a particular concern for the US Secret Service, which is the agency in charge of combating currency counterfeiting. In testimony provided to the US congress in 2010, the Secret Service claimed that successful operations against Colombian counterfeiters had contributed to a relocation of counterfeiting activities to Peru."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Peru Forgers Cashing in on Venezuelas Dollar Demand. Police in Peru have reported that seizures of counterfeit dollars in 2014 were twice as high as the previous year, a pattern likely driven by the demand for fake dollars in economically unstable countries such as Venezuela and Argentina. According to El Comercio , the fraud division of Peru's investigative police (DIRINCRI) seized nearly $18 million counterfeit dollars in 2014, compared to nine million the year before. They credit increased cooperation with the US Secret Service -- which established a Lima office in 2012 -- as well as skyrocketing demand for US currency in some parts of Latin America. ""The increase in seizures could be due to a higher number of criminal acts and not the efficiency of the police,"" one expert told El Comercio. However, police dismantled a record five counterfeiting groups in 2014, according to a December 2 press conference given by Interior Minister Daniel Urresti. The latest bust occurred in November 2014, when police seized $3.7 million in fake cash. Criminal groups send fake money to Venezuela, Argentina, and the United States by using currency ""mules,"" who carry a mixture of counterfeit bills and real money on their person or in their luggage. A policeman from the DIRINCRI told InSight Crime that Peruvian forgers had a huge market in Venezuela, where hunger for dollars and the presence of an immense black market was providing counterfeiters with a bonanza. Peru has now reportedly become the largest producer of counterfeit dollars in the world. One US investigator told Global Post that 17 percent of fake dollars in the United States come from Peru. It isn't limited to dollars either: Peruvian counterfeiters also forge euros and the local currency, nuevo soles. Peruvian forgers are highly skilled and tend to use offset printers and other intricate techniques, unlike US based counterfeiters who mostly use photocopiers. Yet it is Latin America that is providing the boon for Peruvian counterfeiters, where an appetite for US dollars in countries like Venezuela and Argentina is driven by prolonged financial crises and strict foreign exchange controls. Not only do black markets offer staggering exchange rates for dollars -- in Venezuela, one US dollar could fetch up to 173.8 bolivars in mid-January 2015, compared to an official rate of just 6.3 -- but the clandestine nature of those markets makes it easier for forgeries to be passed into circulation."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Peru Counterfeit Dollars Feed Venezuela, US Markets. Police in Peru have disbanded a criminal organization that manufactured counterfeit dollars for markets in Venezuela, Argentina, Bolivia, and the United States, highlighting efforts by counterfeiters to take advantage of tight currency controls that have spurred thriving black markets. On November 30, Peru's investigative police, known as the DININCRI by its acronym in Spanish, seized $3.7 million in fake dollars and captured four members of a counterfeit money ring, reported El Nacional. The criminal group allegedly trafficked counterfeit dollars using ""mules"" -- individuals who transport small quantities of illicit items or substances on their person or in their luggage. Walter Escalante, the head of the Peruvian investigative police unit that handles fraud, stated that criminal groups typically introduce counterfeit bills into foreign markets by mixing them with real currency, reported AFP. According to Interior Minister Daniel Urresti, in 2014 Peruvian police have seized close to $18 million counterfeit dollars and 900,000 counterfeit Euros that were destined for the United States. He called this a ""record figure"" in Peru's fight against fake currency. Criminal groups appear to be taking advantage of tight currency controls in Venezuela and Argentina that have made it difficult for residents to obtain dollars. These restrictions have fostered the development of an unregulated currency market , which likely provides criminal groups with an easy way to introduce counterfeit bills. An official from Peru's investigative police has previously told InSight Crime that Venezuela is a major destination for counterfeit bills produced in Peru, many of which end up in Miami, where Venezuelan businesses and individuals attempt to deposit them. Peru is one of the world's main producers of fake dollars, and concern over counterfeit bills has prompted the US government to work with Peruvian authorities in anti-counterfeit operations. Since 2012 -- when the US Secret Service estimated that 17 percent of all fake dollars in the United States had been printed in Peru -- the US Embassy in Lima has had a Secret Service agent tasked with tracking down counterfeiters. On a regional level, Panama, El Salvador, and Ecuador are also popular destinations for counterfeit dollars, since all of these countries use the US dollar as their official currency. Peruvian counterfeit dollars are also sent to West African nations , which serve as transit points for fake currency shipments bound for Europe."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Death of King of Gasoline Marks End of Era for Mexican Oil Thieves. For over twenty years, Francisco Guizar Pavon consolidated an empire in central Mexico built on stolen fuel to become the ""King of Gasoline"" but his murder last month marked the latest casualty of the increasingly deadly illegal fuel trade. On the morning of February 21 , Pavon was shot at least eight times with a high-caliber weapon by unidentified assailants while driving through the upscale neighborhood of Lomas de Angelopolis, in the city of Puebla, south of Mexico City. Pavon's murder comes just over three months after the assassination of his son-in-law, a deputy for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional - PRI) in the neighboring state of Veracruz. In addition to his residence in Puebla, Pavon also owned several luxury properties in his native Veracruz, where he founded his criminal enterprise , according to Diario Cambio. A former employee of the Mexican oil giant Pemex, Pavon first delved into illegal gasoline - commonly referred to in Mexico as ""huachicol"" - when he was laid off in 1993. He soon amassed a considerable fortune by capitalizing upon his contacts in the oil industry, who would tip him off when gasoline was passing through the massive oil pipelines that cross the state. Pavon, or ""Pancho G"" as he was known in his hometown of Tierras Blancas, gained a reputation as a Robin Hood-like figure, providing locals with cheap gas and well-paying jobs in his criminal organization. Eventually, he branched out into other areas like farming, construction and taxis, all while continuing to build his oil theft empire to become known as Mexico's ""King of Gasoline."" The fact that Pavon ran his empire from Puebla is no surprise - the state has long been an epicenter of the illegal gas trade. Dozens of pipelines carrying fuel from the Gulf of Mexico intersect in a region in the center of the state known as the "" Red Triangle "" before branching off and continuing towards Mexico City and other areas. But while fuel theft has long been a problem in the state, the number of illegal taps has skyrocketed in recent years, increasing nearly 5,000 percent since 2010, according to Pemex data. Increasing oil theft has been linked with spiraling violence , particularly in Guanajuato which became the deadliest state in Mexico in 2019, in large part due to violence related to oil theft, InSight Crime reported. But the daytime murder of Pavon is another reminder of how Puebla has become a battleground between rival groups fighting to control this lucrative economy. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has made oil theft a major security priority for his administration, rallying against both the thieves themselves as well as corrupt Pemex officials. Nevertheless, his strategy of deploying the military to guard refineries, cracking down on criminal groups and transporting some oil supplies by truck, has seen only limited success. Despite reducing the amount of gasoline stolen, the number of illegal taps on oil pipelines has slightly increased. Pavon was part of the old guard of Mexican huachicoleros (oil thieves), his reputation as a benevolent folk hero a throwback to a bygone era when stolen fuel was a less violent, less contested criminal economy. When oil theft first emerged as a sustained practice in the 1990s, oil thieves or ""huachicoleros"" operated on a small scale and generally eschewed violence, often preferring instead to earn the goodwill of locals through handouts of gasoline or sponsoring town festivals, Rolling Stone reported. Such thieves have been the subject of songs , and even have an informal patron saint , ""El Nino Huachicolero"" (The Boy Oil Thief) - a figure of the infant Jesus holding a jerry can and hose. El Nino Huachicolero, the unofficial patron saint of oil thieves However, with the entry of larger cartels, oil theft became far more violent. In 2010 , the Zetas became the first cartel to muscle in on huachicol. Using military-style equipment and tactics, the group added oil theft to their criminal portfolio which already included extortion, kidnapping, arms trafficking and drugs. Oil theft became a multi-billion dollar trade, reaching an estimated $3.25 billion in 2018, before President Lopez Obrador's reforms. One Zetas sicario even went as far as declaring that illegal gasoline was ""approximately as profitable as drugs,"" in a Rolling Stone investigation. Today, the two groups most known for oil theft are the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion - CJNG), one of the country's two largest criminal groups, and the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel , which specializes in illegal gasoline but is mostly confined in Guanajuato. The two groups have contributed to an explosion of violence in Central Mexico, with massacres and targeted assassinations alike. It is likely that Pavon was one of the many victims of this conflict. In Puebla, the CJNG is reportedly fighting a remnant of the now-defunct Zetas, known as the Old School Zetas (Zetas Vieja Escuela), for control of the oil trade, according to a December 2019 report by the United States Congressional Research Service. After Pavon's death, it is unlikely that another King of Gasoline will emerge to claim the throne; the context that propelled him to the top of the fuel game has simply changed too much. Facing an uncertain government crackdown, it is far more likely that the remaining scraps of his huachicol empire will be fought over by neighboring cartels, fanning the flames of conflict even further."	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
Two Attacks on PEMEX Highlight Increasing Dangers. Two attacks by suspected organized criminal gangs on state oil workers in Mexico in recent days have left two dead and one kidnapped. The attacks, which occurred in two different parts of the country, highlight the way in which gangs are increasingly targeting Mexico's state oil company, known by its Spanish acronym PEMEX, as a way of diversifying their criminal portfolios. Last week, two PEMEX employees were found dead near a company natural gas field in Burgos, Tamaulipas, along the Mexican border with Texas, the Milenio news organization reported. The two men were beaten to death, authorities told the media, adding that men identifying themselves as Zetas, the feared criminal syndicate that operates in that state, have been extorting money from the company. Days later, Raul Meza Martinez, an official at PEMEX was kidnapped as he left the company's facilities in Aguascalientes, the capital of the state that goes by the same name in central Mexico, El Occidental reported. No more information is available on Meza Martinez who is presumably being held for ransom. Mexican officials say that 16 PEMEX workers were kidnapped last year, a number that many consider vastly below the real number. Most of the blame is heaped on the Zetas , the former armed wing of the Gulf Cartel that split from their masters and now have cells throughout the country. However, the increasingly fragmented nature of the large mega-organizations is opening up possibilities for numerous smaller criminal groups to delve into kidnapping and extortion. Attacks on PEMEX is just one measure of this increased activity. In addition to the kidnappings, authorities say the company is now losing close to $1 billion per year due to theft of oil from its pipelines. The illegal taps, which InSight has mapped , have caused numerous and often deadly explosions. 	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
"Fish Bladders Mean Big Business for Chinese and Mexican Smugglers. The swim bladder of an endangered fish caught only in Mexico nets tens of thousands of dollars on China's black markets, with traffickers from both countries feeding the illegal trade. The giant fish, a species of drum called totoaba, is banned from international trade but commonly poached off the Gulf of California, according to a report by the Elephant Action League (EAL), a nonprofit wildlife crime watchdog. Three criminals in Mexico are said to be behind the trade in totoaba, prized in Asia for its gas-filled sac, or swim bladder. They fund the poachers in the fishing villages of San Felipe and Santa Clara, and then move the raw fish bladders to cities like Tijuana and Mexicali. There Chinese traders manage the drying, consolidation and eventual smuggling of the fish parts to southern China. The dried swim bladder, or maw, can fetch a price of between $20,000 and $80,000 per kilogram on the black market. Demand for maw stems from its use as an opulent business or wedding gift in China, as well as its value as an investment. Used as an ingredient in soup, the swim bladders have supposed medicinal benefits and are considered a delicacy. An operation last December by Chinese customs officials led to the seizure of 444 kilograms of dried totoaba maw, said to be worth about $26 million - evidence of how surprisingly large and lucrative this illegal wildlife trade is. Though it's unlikely any of Mexico's dominant criminal groups are involved in the totoaba trade, individual drug runners have found ways to cash in. According to the EAL report, the three criminals behind the totoaba trade have all at one time been connected to drug trafficking. One trafficker paid off the Tijuana Cartel to move the swim bladders through areas under the group's control, EAL reported. Last year, authorities arrested a Sinaloa Cartel operative who also allegedly trafficked both drugs and totoaba. His links to the criminal group facilitated the transit of the swim bladders to Asia, El Universal reported. Both Mexican and Chinese criminals have convened in Mexico around the trafficking of totoaba. The Chinese traders, though not known to be from organized crime groups, are said to be involved in the export of other illegal seafood products, according to the EAL investigation. One trader is known as an ""Elder Chinese,"" a member of a group of businessmen who run both ""legal and illegal enterprises,"" according to the report. Totoaba is not the only protected wildlife product that fuels organized crime in Latin America. The poaching of jaguars and pumas for export to China is a lucrative business in Bolivia , where a raw skin is worth several times the average monthly wage. Fins from a single shark can earn fishermen in Peru or Ecuador as much as $100. A kilogram of shark fin sells for $700 in Asia. While Mexican and Chinese wildlife officials have been fighting the totoaba trade for more than half a decade , seizures only seem to get larger. Until overfishing collapses totoaba populations, their bladders will be prized by wealthy Chinese consumers willing to pay high prices, and the trade will continue to provide opportunities for Chinese and Mexican criminal networks alike."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Eco-Trafficking Thrives Along Lawless Guatemala-Belize Border. A poorly defined and lawless border region between Belize and Guatemala is proving to be fertile ground for eco-traffickers to further their criminal interests, underscoring how a lack of government control in such areas helps facilitate these crimes. The business of trafficking prized natural resources like rosewood and colorful scarlet macaws is thriving in the Maya Biosphere Reserve that stretches across northern Guatemala and central Belize's Chiquibul National Park. Citizens in this porous and sparsely patrolled border region lack viable economic opportunities and turn to illegal criminal activities to boost their incomes, Mongabay reported. These criminal networks operating on both sides of the border -- often with financiers in Asia -- employ local farmers on the ground to smuggle fauna and flora from the region through Guatemala's northwest border with Mexico or its northeast border with Belize, where smugglers look for gaps in security personnel. The contraband is then moved using more powerful intermediaries and corrupt government officials through strategic ports in both countries before reaching its final destination, according to Mongabay. The main area affected by this illicit trade is identified as the so-called ""adjacency zone,"" a one-kilometer stretch of land on either side of the border. A long-running border dispute between the two countries stemming back to the 18th century has made it difficult for authorities to intervene, due to uncertainty regarding jurisdiction, leading to the ""unchecked extraction of natural resources,"" according to Mongabay. While the region's rosewood is often destined for places like Hong Kong in southeast Asia, the vibrant scarlet macaw parrots often end up in the hands of wealthy individuals in Mexico and Guatemala. Authorities uncovered two scarlet macaws, for example, in the home of former Guatemala Vice President Roxana Baldetti. The parrots were likely obtained, according to Mongabay, through corrupt officials within the country's National Council for Protected Areas (Consejo Nacional de Areas Protegidas - CONAP). However, authorities were unable to trace where the macaws came from, as the transaction was never documented, according to Aura Marina Lopez Cifuentes of the environmental crimes division of Guatemala's Attorney General's Office, underscoring how corruption facilitates eco-trafficking in the region. The inability of authorities to establish law and order along the Belize-Guatemala border underscores how a lack of state presence in such zones allows criminal groups to flourish and their criminal activities to continue unchecked. Drug trafficking groups in Guatemala's northernmost Peten department -- home to the Maya Biosphere -- have also taken advantage of the poorly secured border area. These groups have long burned large swathes of protected forest to create clandestine landing strips in order to move drug shipments coming from South America out of the country. More than 8,000 hectares of protected tropical forest were burned over the span of only a few months in 2016. A combination of loose border controls and official corruption also helps aid criminal activities in other parts of the region. In Paraguay, for example, illegal loggers rely on the country's porous border with Brazil and corrupt police to traffic timber out of a nature reserve notorious for such criminal activity. The family of former Paraguay President Horacio Cartes has long been accused of facilitating the flow of contraband cigarettes through the so-called ""Tri-Border"" region, a hotspot for illicit activity where Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay meet."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Report Exposes Inner Workings of Timber Trafficking in Peru. A new report into an emblematic case of timber trafficking in Peru highlights the corruption and fraud that continue to sabotage attempts to crack down on a trade that is devastating the Amazon region. The report , released on November 9 by investigative watchdog group Global Witness, tells the story of the most high-profile anti-timber trafficking operation in Peruvian history: the November 2015 attempted seizure of illegal timber from the ship Yacu Kallpa as it was anchored in the Amazon River near the city of Iquitos. On the morning the Yacu Kallpa was set to depart on a journey that would have eventually taken it to Houston, Texas, a public prosecutor boarded the ship and attempted to seize 15 percent of its cargo -- 1,200 square meters of wood that investigators had proven was of illegal origin. The boat eventually departed after a day of murky interventions and legal wrangling that ended with the ship's captain promising the prosecutor to return with the 15 percent after dropping off the rest of the cargo, according to an account of events in an investigation by Wired. However, investigators continued their work, visiting the locations cited in the wood's certificates of origin to verify its extraction. The Yacu Kallpa was eventually detained in Mexico and its cargo seized. By the time they had finished their verification, investigators had established that 96 percent of the cargo -- more than 9,500 square meters -- was ""not of legal origin."" (Credit: Global Witness) The companies exporting the wood denied all wrongdoing. They pointed to the legal documents their shipments possessed, and claimed that if the wood was illegal then they were merely good-faith buyers that had been duped by fraudulent paperwork. If this were true, it would mean that the firms would not meet the criteria for prosecution: that they either knew or ""could presume"" the wood was illegal. The companies' claims received top-level political backing, with then Trade and Tourism Minister Magali Silva and regional Governor Fernando Melendez both intervening on their behalf. However, Global Witness has amassed evidence that at least some -- and likely all -- of these operators were well aware their wood was illegal. Investigators from the watchdog group secretly recorded meetings with executives from the export companies involved. In one such recording, Dante Zevallos from timber company Sico Maderas explains that companies assume their wood is illegal but feel protected by their ability to obtain fraudulent official documents. ""If you sell me timber that has been approved by the government, the law says I have nothing to do with it,"" Zevallos said. ""I can clearly know the timber is not coming from a good source, because if we all bought what we should then nobody would buy a plank."" Zevallos added that this rule applied to the Yacu Kallpa shipment, saying, ""Even though I knew the wood probably had this origin, I wasn't worried because I had [the paperwork] that showed I was a good-faith buyer."" Through the secret camera footage and other investigations, Global Witness also lays out the workings of how such wood is laundered into the legal supply -- practices it describes as an open secret in the timber industry. One of the methods exposed involves purchasing timber from areas where logging is not permitted with false certificates of origin identifying it as being from a legal concession. The legal concessions are often poor quality logging areas that are difficult to access and do not contain the species and quantities desired by exporters. Although the loggers have harvesting plans that should identify which trees are in which concessions and when they can be cut, in reality, tree locations in the plans are often faked by corrupt forestry consultants who draw up the harvesting plans for companies. Another method is the abuse of designated ""bosques local,"" or local forests. The purpose of this category is to allow local rural communities to log meet their self-subsistence and infrastructure needs with only ""small-scale"" quantities allowed to be commercialized. However, investigators discovered most of the logging taking place in many of these areas was large-scale and for commercial purposes. These and other methods, Global Witness adds, would not be possible without the participation of corrupt regional government officials, who have to approve all plans and permits. In the words of another of their secretly recorded subjects, ""the stamp of the governments here has no guarantee."" In recent years, Peru has faced major international pressure, in particular from the United States , to crack down on its illegal timber trade, which results in an estimated 155,000 hectares of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest every year. In some respects, the Yacu Kallpa operation was a major milestone for Peru in this campaign. It was the product of what Global Witness describes as a ""trailblazing"" joint operation involving multiple national and international entities. It represented the first major case utilizing new powers granted by prosecutors in a law introduced just two months before, and led to more than 50 cases being opened and more than 100 people being investigated. It effectively severed the only direct trafficking route connecting the United States to the Peruvian Amazon, a route run exclusively by the Yacu Kallpa. Nevertheless, beyond these success stories, the case also illustrates just how far Peru remains from bringing illegal logging under control. It demonstrates the slow, painstaking and highly specialized work required to prove illegality, which, two years later, has yet to yield prosecutions. The case also shows how the difficulty of combating forest crime stands in stark contrast to the quick and easy fraud and corruption that hides it. The Global Witness investigation also illustrates the powerful forces Peru will have to confront as it moves forward with tackling the trade. The operation sparked a major backlash in logging areas; Iquitos and the city of Pucallpa were rocked by protests that saw the office of the government's forest and wildlife inspection agency fire-bombed. It also prodded into action some of the shadowy, wealthy and influential powers that facilitate illegal logging in Peru. Aside from the interventions by the local governor and government minister, the wake of the operation saw the inspection agency's crusading president Rolando Navarro fired. He later fled the country in fear for his life after receiving multiple death threats. The new powers granted to prosecutors in such cases, meanwhile, were rolled back under heavy pressure from the timber industry shortly thereafter, according to Global Witness. To address these issues and confront these powers will take time, resources and a strong commitment to tackling corruption that runs from top to bottom. The Yacu Kallpa operation may now be an emblematic case, but it is still just a small, tentative step along this path."	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
"How Trumps Environmental Policy Undermines LatAm Security. US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from a global agreement to fight climate change hinders efforts to tackle environmental challenges in Latin America and the Caribbean, which have compounded longstanding problems related to organized crime. Trump announced on June 1 that the United States would back out of the so-called Paris Agreement , a landmark 2015 deal signed by 195 countries that aims to ""undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects, with enhanced support to assist developing countries to do so."" The decision led to immediate rebuke by politicians and business leaders alike. On the day of the announcement, a spokesperson for the United Nations Secretary-General called the move a ""major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security."" In keeping with his ""America First"" doctrine, Trump said the Paris deal imposed unfair burdens on the United States that would harm its economy and do little to mitigate the dangers of climate change. Few mentioned crime, but the reality is that mitigating climate change is a key part of addressing major global security challenges, including in the Americas. Impacted Region According to a recent report by the advocacy group Germanwatch, four of the ten countries most affected by climate change over the past decade are in Latin America and the Caribbean: Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua and Guatemala. However, experts say that throughout the region, planning for climate-related security risks has been insufficient. ""Politicians need to start to factor into their policymaking the environment. And they're not presently doing that,"" Oliver Leighton Barrett, a retired Navy lieutenant who has worked with the Pentagon on efforts to assess the security implications of climate change in Latin America and Caribbean, told InSight Crime. ""There are two kinds of emergencies,"" he explained, ""Slow onset [like hurricanes] and rapid onset [like sea-level rise or long-term drought]."" ""Cities simply cannot afford to delay action."" He added: ""It's hard for people to get their head around and to organize a response to the slow-moving one, the slow onset-type scenario, because it kind of just creeps on you."" Cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change, primarily because cities are where most people live and where most of the violent crime is occurring. ""Cities simply cannot afford to delay action. There is a real risk that the fastest-growing cities adopt outdated planning models that lead to resource-intensive plans and infrastructure,"" Robert Muggah, the director of the Igarape Institute think tank, wrote in a 2016 article for the World Economic Forum. ""Ultimately, the future of climate change resides in decisions taken by cities in areas with the most rapidly growing economies and population."" 'Threat Multiplier' Upheavals in the environment mean chaos, and chaos opens the door to crime. The US military itself described climate change as a ""threat multiplier"" in a July 2015 report to Congress. ""Global climate change will have wide-ranging implications for US national security interests over the foreseeable future because it will aggravate existing problems -- such as poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual leadership, and weak political institutions -- that threaten domestic stability in a number of countries,"" the report reads. This notion was echoed by Barrett. He calls climate a ""stressor upon a host of other stressors already, and that can be the straw that breaks the camel's back."" ""Global climate change will have wide-ranging implications for US national security interests over the foreseeable future."" Many countries in the region, he added, ""have no resiliency whatsoever"" to climate change, making them particularly vulnerable to its negative effects. ""They're politically fragile. They have very weak institutions, fractured populations -- poor populations in particular -- and then you have the security concerns fueled by drug-related activities. And the thing is they all converge,"" he explained. ""It's not just climate change. It's all these trends coming together -- overpopulation, urbanization and also poor governance -- and those by themselves are bad enough. And then you throw on top of that a long dry spell? Then there you have your seeds for disaster,"" he said. In certain cases, even when governments in the region have attempted to respond to climate-related disasters, organized crime has found a way to profit. In one remarkable instance, the Honduran crime group known as the Cachiros was allegedly able to use the relief effort following a devastating 2010 hurricane to launder an estimated $6.4 million of illegal earnings. Criminal networks in Honduras have also been known to use violence against environmental activists seeking to protect areas of the country from potential environmental harm related to economic development projects. Feedback Loop Brazil, the largest country in the region, is a particularly illustrative example of how organized crime itself can contribute to climate change, which can in turn create a feedback loop that exacerbates existing security problems. After decades of deforestation fueled in large part by organized crime activities , experts say that the world's biggest rainforest, the Amazon, may be at a "" tipping point "": continued deforestation could lead to a vicious cycle of drought like the one seen in the United States during the infamous ""Dust Bowl"" of the 1930s. Drought related to deforestation poses risks not only to the largely uninhabited Amazon, but also to some of the most important urban areas in the region. For instance, the largest city in the Americas, Sao Paulo, like much of Brazil's heavily-populated southeast, suffered a severe drought between 2014 and 2016 that was linked to Amazon deforestation. During that time, there was widespread public unrest in Brazil over myriad issues, including economic challenges that were brought into stark display when the government enforced rationing of the water supply. The drought -- combined with a broader economic slowdown and an increased burden on security forces due to mass protests and an influx of tourists for the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games -- complicated efforts to address underlying causes of crime and violence in Brazil's major urban centers. Indeed, after years of declines, violence has been rising recently in both Sao Paulo and Brazil's second largest city, Rio de Janeiro. The drug trade, as well as other illicit industries like illegal mining and eco trafficking, also contribute to deforestation and other forms of environmental damage. This only leads to more migration to the cities where most of the crime is occurring. Ceding Space to Other Countries Dealing with both slow and rapid onset events related to climate change will require multilateral coordination that the US could help lead. Collaborative efforts on this front gained steam under the administration of Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, which called combating climate change "" a top US priority ."" But Trump's team seems disinclined to take any action at all to fight climate change, much less in conjunction with international partners. This could not only hamper the rest of the world's efforts to head off a climate catastrophe, but it could also hinder efforts by the United States to cooperate with partner nations on a host of other challenges, including in the security realm. In particular, Barrett said, ""the symbolism of America abdicating its 'Big Boy' seat at the global climate change mitigation table is significant. It leaves a leadership vacuum for America's premier peer competitor, China, to fill. ""President Trump's decision yesterday makes it politically easier for traditional US partners in the region to make the pivot towards China as their 'partner of choice' for a range of issues,"" he said. ""If there was ever any question in their minds about which superpower has their best interests at heart, yesterday's ill-advised decision provided clarity."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Brazil Policy Not Enough to Combat Wood Trafficking: Report. A recent newspaper report describes how a government strategy meant to combat illegal logging in Brazil -- via the creation of special zones where private companies can harvest wood on protected land -- is falling short. As reported by Folha , since 2006, the Brazilian government has allowed private companies to sustainably harvest tropical wood within select areas of Brazil's National Forests. This policy was intended to discourage illegal loggers from operating in these concession zones. However, the report states that the market for sustainably harvested wood in Brazil is still minuscule -- most of this timber ends up exported to Europe. One Brazilian logging company estimates that over 70 percent of the timber traded within Brazil was harvested illegally. This timber is either given a fake certification of legality, or is sold in an informal market where no one checks the requisite documents. Thus far, the government's creation of these concession zones has failed to make the legal, sustainably-harvested timber market more attractive than the illegal market, the Folha report suggests. Tropical wood typically sells for about 150 Brazilian reales (about $39) for every cubic meter, versus 70 reales (about $18) for wood grown on plantations. Nevertheless, by 2022, the Brazilian government wants 40 percent of all timber production in the Amazon to come from private concessions in National Forests. Currently, that number stands at one percent, according to Folha. Timber trafficking is known to fuel violence and crime in Brazil -- hundreds of environmental activists have been killed in the country, with many cases linked to illegal logging. While deforestation rates overall are going down in Brazil , illegal logging is still responsible for much of the problem, alongside mining and ranching. Brazil has taken other steps to combat illegal logging, including creating a new special security force unit earlier this year , as well as employing the use of drones. However, one implication of Folha's report is that Brazil could do more to scrutinize the origins of its wood, given how common it is for traffickers to fake the requisite certification. As exposed in a 2014 report by Greenpeace , Brazil's illegally logged timber is often ""laundered"" in various ways -- including the creation of fake documents."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Mexico Seeks New Approach to Tackling Environmental Crime. Authorities in Mexico have called for legal reforms that would link environmental and organized crime, a measure which -- if adopted -- could lead to a significant improvement in how governments across Latin America combat the scourge of illicit wildlife trafficking. During a recent conference on wildlife and forest crime held in Cancun, representatives from Mexico's Attorney General's Office for Environmental Protection (Profepa) said the lack of a normative framework linking environmental and organized crime has impeded effective action against the region's eco-traffickers, reported El Universal. Israel Alvarado, Director of Profepa's environmental crimes unit, spoke of the necessity for legal reforms throughout the region that recognize the connection between environmental and organized crime. Alvarado said eco-traffickers use the same methods and routes as drug and arms traffickers, and that linking the two would permit investigators to use tools already being utilized in the fight against organized crime, such as wiretaps, electronic surveillance and undercover operations. Alvarado also suggested considering earnings derived from eco-trafficking as a form of money laundering, thereby allowing banking institutions and financial investigation units to help dismantle these networks. The conference, which was organized by Profepa and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), was intended to identify common strategies for combating environmental crime, and was attended by representatives from 16 Latin American and Caribbean countries. Calls for linking environmental crime with organized crime is perhaps indicative of a growing awareness about the prevalence of eco-trafficking in Latin America, and the need for legal measures to combat its detrimental effects. The black market for wildlife is big business , netting traffickers an estimated $19 billion per year globally. Owing to its biodiversity, Latin America is a key region sourcing this illicit trade, with the practice of "" shark finning "" -- whereby sharks are killed for their fins to make shark fin soup, a delicacy in Asia -- a particularly acute problem. Indeed, just days following the conclusion of the conference in Cancun, Mexican authorities confiscated 3,559 kilos of shark fins and 529 fish bladders (also used to make soup) that were destined for Hong Kong. In addition to wildlife trafficking, illegal logging is another major criminal industry in several countries throughout the region , most notably Peru and Brazil. The challenge of confronting eco-trafficking in Latin America is compounded by several issues. These include a general lack of awareness, weak legal enforcement, and a host of criminal groups with pre-existing smuggling networks ready to profit from the trade. As such, if Latin American countries do in fact start to pursue eco-traffickers much as they already do organized crime networks, this would likely be an important step towards tackling a trade that has had devastating environmental impacts throughout the region."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Pirates Target New Treasure: Shrimp. Heavily armed pirates have been hijacking shrimp catches along Mexico's Pacific Coast, perhaps the work of cartel gunmen with time on their hands, or a sign of an interruption in cocaine shipments. According to an investigation by El Universal , around $800,000 of shrimp has been stolen from shrimpers working off the coast of the state of Sinaloa following 14 robberies during the 2013 to 2014 shrimp season -- an almost five-fold increase on the three robberies reported during the 2012 to 2013 season. The pirates using go-fast boats to ambush the shrimping vessels at sea and are equipped with bullet proof vests and assault rifles. Raul Benitez Manaut, an investigator at Mexico's National Autonomous University, said the breakdown in the Sinaloa Cartel after the recent captures of important leaders -- including boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman -- may be behind the increase in shrimp boat robberies and that the problem will likely escalate. He warned that authorities need to ensure that these robberies do not ""begin to be become modus operandi"" for armed cells within the drug cartels. According to Benitez, a shrimp price increase of 30 to 40 percent has led to it being labeled ""blue gold"" and may also explain the rise in robberies. This appears not to be an isolated example. In Honduras it is estimated nearly 3.5 million pounds of shrimp -- about $10 million worth -- are stolen each year, according to the National Aquaculture Association of Honduras. The equipment and methods used to carry out these crimes -- speedboats and military-grade weaponry -- suggest the robbers are highly organized. It is unlikely they were formed to rob shrimp catches, but rather worked for the drug trade. Criminal organizations often move cocaine via maritime routes along both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts, using go-fast boats, submarines, yachts and fishing vessels, or a mix of them all. The shipments often travel with their own protection and also employ local fisherman as drivers and watchmen, or to bring drugs to shore. Such ties have often brought drug violence to fishing towns and islands, including Nicaragua's Bluefields , Colombia's San Andres island , islands off Panama's coasts , and Ecuador's province of Manabi. Mexico has drug cartels using both its Gulf and Pacific coasts. With the increasing fragmentation of the large international drug cartels , criminal organizations often subcontract out select jobs along the drug chain to local criminal groups, with transportation being one of them. It is quite possible that, as security services operations have disrupted the flow of drugs, one or more groups dedicated to trafficking along the Sinaloa coast could be using their knowledge of the seas, and fishing practices, to make up for lost profits. If so, this would be just another example of the diversification of criminal portfolios away from a total reliance on drugs, to activities like extortion, kidnapping and now it seems, shrimp piracy."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Massive Mexico Illegal Wood Seizure Sign of Criminal Diversity. Authorities in Mexico have seized a record 10,000 ton haul of illegal timber worth more than $1 million, another indication of the wide range of illicit activities undertaken by criminal organizations to increase revenue streams. The seizure was made after raids in five of the 21 municipalities where foresting takes place in the western state of Michoacan (see Excelsior image below), and resulted in a record seizure of more than $1.1 million worth of wood, reported Excelsior. Commissioner for Security and Development Alfredo Castillo on tweeted that the timber equated to about 9,000 trees (see below). Mexico's Federal Attorney's Office for Environmental Protection (PROFEPA) and other security forces also confiscated 13 sawmills, two wood shredders, 11 vehicles, and other machinery and equipment. The seized wood was mostly pine and Mexican fir. Que equivalen a casi 9 mil arboles (2/8) pic.twitter.com/ydYacHpxbL -- Alfredo Castillo C. (Comisionadomich) April 11, 2014 Though the seizure has not officially been attributed to any particular criminal group, some media reports suggested it was the work of the Knights Templar. Mexico has the 12th largest forested area in the world, and 3rd in Latin America, according to the 2010 Global Forest Resources Assessment from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). In January 2014, Nuestravision Noticias reported that over 60,000 hectares of woodland are lost to illegal logging per year. In a case underscoring the involvement of organized crime in timber theft, Excelsior highlighted a 2011 uprising by a community in Michoacan that saw protesters complain of official complicity in the theft of 50 percent of trees around the town of Cheran by organized criminal groups. If organized crime is to blame for this most recent seizure, it would be yet another example of the diverse interests such groups have established in the hunt for criminal income. In March 2014, it was reported that Mexican pirates had stolen over $800,000 of shrimp from fishermen in the state of Sinaloa during the 2013-2014 shrimping season. Michoacan has also recently been identified as one of the five Mexican states in which mining is reportedly under the control of criminal organizations, and the Knights Templar cartel is also known to have a major stake in the iron and steel industry -- which lost over $1.3 billion to theft and illegal mining in 2013.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Demand From China Fueling Nicaraguas Wood Trafficking Trade. Demand from Chinese buyers has contributed to the growth of an illicit trafficking network that is moving record amounts of granadillo wood out of Nicaragua , according to a new report by investigative website Confidencial. The Confidencial report finds that exports of granadillo have grown exponentially in Nicaragua since 2008. The wood is traditionally used to make musical instruments like marimbas, but is also in demand by furniture producers and makers of luxury items like Rolls Royces and yachts. (Watch a video of the Confidencial report below). In 2008 just over $127,000 of granadillo were exported from Nicaragua to six countries. In 2011, that number grew to $6 million worth of exports. The explosion in demand was driven by an influx of Chinese buyers, the Confidencial report states. Chinese buyers began to use Nicaragua as a primary source of granadillo after facing stricter controls on wood exports in other Central American countries like Panama, Nicaragua's second-largest wood exporter told Confidencial. The inceased demand has fed the growth of a ""wood mafia"" that illegally harvests granadillo from forest reserves and moves it out of Nicaragua. In one sign of the burgeoning trade, in January 2012 the military seized a $1.35 million shipment of granadillo in a single operation. As the Confidencial report highlights, wildlife trafficking can be a very lucrative business, depending on the product. Granadillo sells for $11 per board-foot (a unit of measurement for lumber). And with over 570,000 board-feet seized in Nicaragua seized so far in 2011, this represents some $6.2 million in profits. Nicaragua's wood trafficking ""mafia"" works similiarly to the drug trade, in the sense that both businesses are dependent on a network of transporters to move the product, and a network of complicit officials who turn a blind eye. Confidencial notes that while some truck drivers who move illicit granadillo shipments have been arrested, this hasn't brought authorities any closer to building a case against the real ""kingpins"" behind the trade. The illegal timber industry is a significant problem elsewhere in the region, including Colombia and Peru. Peru's illegal timber exports are thought to bring in up to $72 million in profits per year."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Drug Gangs Could Make Old Land Conflict Boil Over in South Mexico. A long-running land conflict in southern Mexico is causing new problems, and the situation is made more dangerous by the prospect of intervention from drug trafficking groups and illegal logging interests. The Chimalapas rainforest, located on the border between the southern Mexican states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, is the largest tract of tropical rainforest in Mexico. Its 2,300 square miles are home to a wealth of natural resources, as well as a large percentage of the country's biodiversity. However, it is also home to a decades-old land conflict, one that could get worse as criminal activity increases in the region. Because the boundary separating the two states lies in remote forest, the precise location of the border is poorly defined. As such, when the Chiapas government decided to create four new municipalities in the Chimalapas region earlier this month, it angered Oaxacan farmers in the area who have long claimed that the territory is theirs. In response to the announcement, the Oaxacans have imposed roadblocks around the communities, effectively cutting them off from larger towns nearby and stopping them selling their agricultural goods. The federal government has since sent troops to the area to keep the peace, but residents claim that their movement remains limited. Complicating this conflict is the fact that the Chimalapas region sees a significant amount of organized criminal activity such as drug trafficking and illegal logging. In a recent interview with Mexico's Milenio , Chiapas state Interior Minister Noe Castanon Leon told the publication that the presence of criminal groups could complicate the conflict. ""[Chimalapas] is a complex area, a difficult area,"" Castanon said. ""It is one of the most beautiful in Chiapas, there's the whole pine reserve, and we obviously we have rare wood across the region, rich in vegetation and well there is a strong incentive for those who seek to illegally harvest the timber."" Timber disputes have also been fueled by organized criminal groups in Cheran, Michoacan state, where locals barricaded their town against government forces in protest against the authorities' failure to stop illegal wood-cutters backed by the dominant Familia Michoacana drug gang. Drug trafficking groups are also active in the Chimalapas region, and local officials claim that poppy and marijuana cultivation is widespread. This does not bode well for the future of the Chimapalas conflict. While it's not clear whether they maintain links to criminal activity in the region, the dominant criminal group in Chiapas is the Zetas , who are known as most violent of Mexico's cartels. They also enjoy a reputation for infiltrating the military, meaning that the troop presence may not be entirely effective. The cartel was initially composed almost exclusively of former Special Forces soldiers, and actively attempts to recruit members of the military with promises of better pay. To make matters worse, evidence suggests that the increased troop presence could serve as a irritant for the land conflict, as it could provoke the ire of drug trafficking organizations in the region. As InSight Crime has reported , troop surges have a mixed record in Mexico. In places where the military was deployed to fight drug cartels, homicide rates actually spiked. After the military began patrolling Ciudad Juarez in 2007, for instance, homicide rates in the state of Chihuahua rose from 14.4 murders per 100,000 people to 75.2 in 2008 and 108.5 in 2009.

"Venezuela Archipelago, New Hotspot for Drug Smuggling. The Los Roques Archipelago -- a group of islands off Venezuela's northern coast known for their white sand beaches and turquoise waters -- has become a staging ground for smuggling drugs and gold through the Caribbean. On October 29, Jose Luis Pirela, the president of the Subcommission for the Fight Against Drugs, Terrorism and Organized Crime of Venezuela's National Assembly, said that an organized crime gang was operating from the islands off shore from Venezuela's Vargas state to move drugs and gold to Caribbean nations, especially Bonaire, El Pitazo reported. Speaking to the National Assembly, Pirela alleged that the gang includes Carlos Betancourt and Noel Lugo, identifying them as the cousin and brother of Stella Betancourt. Since 2017, Stella Betancourt has been the head of government for the Francisco de Miranda island territory, which includes Los Roques. Between 2008 and 2017, Betancourt was governor of the state of Falcon, which is close to Los Roques and the Dutch Caribbean islands. Pirela said that the gang was acting in partnership with an Italian businessmen with hotels and bars in Los Roques, and Venezuelan Jose Ramon Llavanera, who has been convicted of drug trafficking in the United States, according to El Pitazo. Llavanera, according to Pirela's testimony, acts as an intermediary, organizing drug shipments between Los Roques and Bonaire. Pirela said that Llavanera ""uses his own King 200 aircrafts"" and that details of the planes would be given to appropriate ""international organizations so investigations could be carried out."" Pirela said he planned to meet the governor of Bonaire, Edison Enrique Rijna, to exchange information on how the gang operates. The use of Los Roques to get drugs out of Venezuela makes sense. The archipelago lies only 176 kilometers -- or a 30-minute flight -- from Caracas and 167 kilometers from Bonaire in the Dutch Antilles. The Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao are increasingly being used to smuggle illegal gold and move cocaine coming from Colombia via Venezuela. A tugboat registered to a Venezuelan company, for example, was recently seized off the coast of Aruba after two tons of cocaine were discovered onboard. After dozens of migrants drowned when their boat wrecked on its way to Curacao, it was discovered that local gangs were using the migrant transports as cover for cocaine shipments. The island nations, which have ties to the Netherlands, serve as a transshipment point to feed cocaine to Europe. They have also long been used as a transshipment point for drugs that are then moved to the United States. Los Roques has been in the spotlight before. In September 2019, the Venezuelan Ecological Society (Sociedad Venezolana de Ecologia -- SVE) denounced the government of Nicolas Maduro for granting illegal concessions for infrastructure projects in the archipelago. The SVE acted after the Ministry of Tourism offered domestic and foreign investors the opportunity to build ""high-level tourist accommodation"" in Los Roques, despite Venezuelan laws prohibiting new construction inside national parks. If Pirela's accusations prove correct, it could mean that the presence of foreign-run hotels in the region may be used to facilitate drug trafficking in the Caribbean."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Guyanas Mining Region is Open Door to Venezuelan Organized Crime. A recent Crisis Group report explores criminal dynamics in the Guyanese mining region bordering Venezuela, revealing how the chaos and violence of Venezuela's mining arc is spilling over into the neighboring country. The report, titled ""Troubled Waters along the Guyana-Venezuela Border,"" shines a spotlight on the gold mining village of Etheringbang, in the Essequibo region of western Guyana. The town is situated on the banks of the Cuyuni River, which both marks the Venezuelan border and represents a key highway for contraband and migration flows between the two states. Just across the river from Etheringbang, Colombian guerrillas from the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) and the Venezuelan mafias known as ""sindicatos"" battle for control of Venezuela's illegal gold mines. The Guyanese miners conduct their operations in the shadow of these armed groups. The report describes how boats carrying supplies to the Guyanese mines must pass three checkpoints, controlled respectively by the ELN, the sindicatos, and Venezuelan security forces. At each, extortion payments are charged at gunpoint. Already, in November 2018, sindicatos raided one of the Guyanese mines, entering into a firefight with local mine owners. The ELN has an encampment almost within sight of Etheringbang, where it has controlled cross-border movements for for at least two years. In 2017, Venezuelan congressman Williams Davila visited Anacoco island , on the Guyanese side of the Cuyuni River close to Etheringbang. His intention was to proclaim Venezuelan sovereignty over the Essequibo region, which Venezuela lays claim to and considers to be under Guyanese occupation. The delegation was stopped at a checkpoint by heavily-armed ELN guerrillas. To Bram Ebus, author of the Crisis Group report, the incident was a stark demonstration of the true balance of power in Essequibo. ""It was a reality check for them to know that really, it's the ELN occupying that region,"" he told InSight Crime. The vulnerability of the Guyanese miners is exacerbated not only by the region's remoteness, but also by the ambiguous legal status of their own operations. These factors force them into an uneasy symbiotic relationship with the armed groups on the Venezuelan border, creating an open door for cross-border criminal economies. Although Essequibo is internationally recognized as part of Guyana, Venezuela's territorial claims have discouraged foreign, large-scale investment in the region for several decades. As a result, Guyanese mining operations tend to be small and isolated, lacking the resources to develop reliable supply infrastructure. They are therefore dependent on the criminal groups that smuggle necessary supplies across the Venezuelan border. ""All the Guyanese miners get their fuel from Venezuela, because it's closer and much cheaper,"" Ebus told InSight Crime. ""If you take a lancha from Etheringbang up and down the river, you see all these farms on the river bank with 50 drums of fuel stacked somewhere. The biggest business at the three checkpoints is taxing all the drums of fuel."" Though most Guyanese mines have some kind of legal title, the industry lacks formal regulation , giving it many of the hallmarks of illegal operations, Ebus said. The use of mercury is widely tolerated. According to Ebus, reports of gold pricing are contradictory, making it unclear to what extent Venezuelan gold is entering the Guyanese supply chain, or vice versa. Some sources claim that the metal can fetch a higher price in Venezuela, where President Nicolas Maduro is increasingly dependent on the resource to keep his cash-strapped administration afloat. Others claim that Guyana provides a convenient destination to launder illegal Venezuelan gold. With no meaningful border checks between the two countries, there is little to prevent the commodity being smuggled in either direction. Other cross-border criminal dynamics include human trafficking and prostitution. To the miners of Etheringbang, desperate Venezuelan women sell ""survival sex"" for fragments of gold. Meanwhile, larger and more lucrative prostitution rings are run by criminal networks on both sides of the border. ""In Georgetown, I know someone who owns a hotel, a Guyanese man,"" Ebus said. ""He'll send messages to San Felix or Puerto Ordaz in Bolivar state [Venezuela], saying I need so many women, of such an age, and the Venezuelans send them to him."" Ebus is clear that although such trafficking flows may be directed by Venezuelans, they are also reliant on Guyanese handlers in the ports along the Cuyuni. Corruption also permeates the Guyanese police in towns such as Etheringbang. ""Local miners all have to pay the police in gold,"" Ebus said. ""The police are walking around in plain clothes, drinking beers, wearing big necklaces and rings. One time [I saw] a guy from the Venezuelan National Guard come over to Guyana to have a few beers with the local officers."" The Guyanese army claims to maintain a presence along the border, but keeps at a safe distance, knowing themselves to be hopelessly outnumbered by the forces on the Venezuelan side. Unable to rely on state protection, the Guyanese mine owners are resorting to arming themselves through private security contractors. ""These are like Guyanese mercenaries with big weaponry, trying to defend mining interests on the Guyanese side,"" Ebus explained. But he described their main role as guarding against low-level theft, doubting they could offer more than symbolic protection against an organized Venezuelan attack. ""For now, I don't see the possibility of a big escalation,"" he said. ""This is just the new law and order in that neck of the world."""	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"GameChangers 2019: Illegal Mining, Latin Americas Go-To Criminal Economy. The criminal, economic and political dynamics behind illegal gold rushes this past year in Venezuela and Ecuador were very different. But both countries illustrate the same trend: that illegal mining has become the fastest growing criminal economy wherever there are deposits to exploit. Over the last decade, illegal mining has come to rival the drug trade for profits in mineral-rich corners of South America. The illegal mining boom took off in Colombia and Peru, and the criminal dynamics that emerged there have provided a blueprint for its expansion into Ecuador, Venezuela, and Brazil. In Ecuador, the chance discovery of a gold deposit has spurred a massive illegal economy , attracting thousands of workers, including desperate Venezuelan migrants, to rudimentary mines that have also become hotbeds for sex trafficking, drugs and violence. In Venezuela, proceeds from illegal gold have strengthened the irregular armed groups present in the country, from Colombian paramilitaries and guerrillas to ""sindicatos,"" or local mafias. They have also fueled the rise of other bad actors, including Venezuela's ""megabandas"" -- large gangs that took root in the slums of Caracas and now have moved on to control mines in remote parts of the country. Venezuela's illegal gold trade has generated enormous illicit wealth for corrupt state officials and helped prop up its government , as other legal economies are stymied and the economy continues in freefall. Venezuela's and Ecuador's move into illegal gold -- following similar trends in Colombia and Peru -- offers lessons for other countries in the region as to how this illegal economy spreads like cancer and supercharges criminal groups. Ecuador, Where Illegal Mining Replaced the FARC Ecuador is experiencing a new illegal gold rush along its northern border with Colombia. While much of the boom was the result of an accidental find, the emergence of mining as a new criminal growth economy in this region is no coincidence: there was an economic vacuum to fill and illegal mining became the go-to industry. In late 2017, thousands of treasure seekers descended on the district of Buenos Aires in the province of Imbabura after a construction crew unearthed gold while breaking ground on a road project. By the start of 2019, as many as 10,000 miners had taken over the area. The miners opened an estimated 1,000 rudimentary mines and set up around 200 processing mills. The miners were backed by mafia mining financiers from the south of the country. They offered start-up capital to be repaid in sacks of ore, which they shipped to the south to be processed in their own processing plants. Soon, the riches attracted criminal gangs, which began extorting the miners and the businesses that sprung up around the mining camps, including bars, restaurants and brothels. The initial wave of criminal groups came from the province of Esmeraldas on Ecuador's western border with Colombia. However, these homegrown criminals were driven out by Colombian armed groups, who seized control of the region with high-powered weaponry and a willingness to use extreme violence. In July 2019, thousands of police and military were deployed to the region to clear out the mines. While the future of the area remains in the balance, there can be little doubt that the Buenos Aires boom represents just the most visible face of a problem. Illegal miners from Buenos Aires have already made incursions into other nearby areas, seeking new gold deposits to open up. Furthermore, mining is on the rise all along the Ecuador-Colombia border as areas that had previously experienced low levels of mining in the provinces of Esmeraldas, Carchi and Sucumbios have seen a steady increase in the size of existing mining operations and a spread of mining to new areas. Authorities in Ecuador seize an illegal gold mine in Esmeraldas: Courtesy of Ecuador's Mining Agency Driving this new gold rush is a collapse in another illegal economy that had previously sustained the border region: supplying the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). The guerrillas' war against the Colombian state provided employment opportunities in everything from providing food, clothing and equipment to their fighters to smuggling precursor chemicals for their cocaine laboratories. When the FARC demobilized in 2017, the income and work opportunities they represented for these poverty-ravaged areas left with them. With no sign of a legal economy to fill the vacuum, locals turned to illegal mining. The gold rush attracted newcomers from all over. When Ecuadoran security forces moved on Buenos Aires, they discovered over 1,000 Venezuelans and nearly as many Colombians. As seen in Buenos Aires, the opportunities also extend to armed groups, gangs and mafias, which both finance and extort mining operations, following a pattern firmly established in neighboring Colombia. As a result, Ecuador's border region has entered a new era based on a new illegal economy and new underworld overlords. The results of this gold boom are likely to be devastating both for the environment and for communities in gold-rich areas dealing with the social problems caused by the incursions of illegal mining. Unless the authorities grasp that the mining explosion is a response by people with few legal alternatives, then illegal gold looks set to underpin the local economy in the same way it has already taken root in Colombia, Peru and elsewhere in the region. Crime Groups and Venezuelan Government Feed on Illegal Gold Gold has become a vital crutch for President Maduro's government in the wake of Venezuela's economic collapse. With oil production stagnant and exports decimated by international sanctions, the state is in dire need of income and has few legal resources left to exploit. Despite US sanctions hitting Venezuelan gold in November 2018, Venezuela has continued to cultivate relationships with alternative international buyers such as Turkey and Dubai. The Maduro administration's desperation to replenish its dwindling gold reserves has created a dynamic of dependency between the government and criminal gangs. At least 80 percent of Venezuela's gold is illegally mined. The state gold company Minerven does little mining itself, but rather channels gold to the Venezuelan Central Bank (Banco Central de Venezuela - BCV) from the plethora of armed groups that control mining throughout the south of the country. In March, the US Treasury placed targeted sanctions on the company and its president, accusing them of ""propping up the illegitimate Maduro regime."" Gold bar from ore mined at Venezuela's orinoco mining arc: Courtesy of Venezuela government Maduro's arrangement with illegal mining interests is convenient to the criminal actors involved. The regime is kept afloat, while criminal gangs reap vast profits unmolested by the state, and the country's economic crisis provides a steady stream of exploitable labor. The local military also profit by charging protection payments to illegal mine operators. Further up in the state hierarchy, government loyalists are also profiting. Venezuelan officials allegedly involved in the illegal gold trade include the country's minister of industries and national production, Tareck el Aissami , and the president's own son, Nicolas Maduro Guerra. In June, the US Treasury sanctioned Maduro Guerra after former Venezuelan intelligence chief Christopher Figuera accused him of setting up a resource company that sold illegally mined gold to the BCV at inflated prices. On the ground, relations among criminal groups are tense. The mining states of Amazonas and Bolivar have seen outbreaks of violence as rival groups battle for control of precious mineral deposits. Many such clashes are associated with the rapid expansion of Colombia's National Liberation Army (Ejercito Nacional de Liberacion - ELN) in Venezuela. In Bolivar state, the ELN has grown its criminal empire by seizing mines from the local mafias known as ""sindicatos,"" committing massacres , and subjecting local mine workers to dangerous conditions. In an International Crisis Group report published in February 2019, a former ELN commander said that the group earned 60 percent of its income from illegal mining in Venezuela and Colombia. Besides gold, the group also reportedly controls coltan mines in Parguaza and diamond mines in San Vicente de Paul. These economies have been a major contributor to the ELN's rapid evolution from a Colombian rebel group to a Colombo-Venezuelan army , with a presence in at least 13 Venezuelan states. Venezuelan megabandas, such as the Tren de Aragua gang, have also used illegal mining to expand their power. From its home turf of Aragua, the gang has spread its tentacles to the south of Bolivar , where it now controls several mineral deposits and exports gold and coltan into Brazil. This diversification has provided the gang with new income streams as the country's impoverishment makes street crime less profitable. Tren de Aragua is now arguably Venezuela's largest homegrown criminal risk, and a budding regional threat as it expands into Colombia, Peru and Brazil. What's more, dissidents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarios de Colombia - FARC) have regrouped in the southern Venezuela state of Amazonas and looked to illegal mining to fund their expansion. The Acacio Medina Front is active in the mines of Yapacana , a region described as a "" giant money laundry by watchdog group SOS Orinoco, which tracks illegal mining in the Amazonas and Orinoco regions of Venezuela. There, guerrilla groups invest drug earnings into the extraction of gold, which can be easily laundered at a higher profit. This income has allowed the ex-FARC mafia to expand its operations to at least eight Venezuelan states over the last year. In the Yapacana mines, local residents report that ex-FARC guerrillas work alongside the ELN in a loose guerrilla alliance , SOS Orinoco reported. Such pacts provide a worrying model for closer criminal cooperation between these groups in the future, particularly in light of reported meetings between ex-FARC and ELN leaders on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In Amazonas, violent clashes have been reported between the ELN and the Venezuelan National Guard, reflecting ongoing tensions over extortion payments demanded by the military. By contrast, in neighboring Bolivar, Venezuelan congressman Americo de Grazia and former governor of Bolivar, Andres Velasquez, have both alleged that the ELN's rapid expansion is the result of a pact with security forces to displace the anarchic local mafias and impose order on the mining region. In October, President Maduro announced that he would turn over a gold mine to be administered by each state governor from his party, to finance their local governments. In November, a wave of atrocities swept the mining region of El Callao, shortly after the governor of Vargas visited the province to take control of his promised gold mine. A local mafia boss circulated a statement threatening local authorities for breaking their pact with the sindicatos and allowing the ELN to enter the region. Local residents claimed that Maduro's plan lay behind this reconfiguration of power. Another emerging trend has been the commission of atrocities in mining regions. In the municipality of Gran Sabana, in the far south of Bolivar, mineral deposits have historically been controlled by the Pemon indigenous group. The last year has witnessed three deadly attacks against Pemon communities, allegedly on the orders of regional authorities, in Canaima , Santa Elena de Uairen , and Ikabaru. Indigenous leaders express the belief that the massacres are the result of a deliberate state strategy to seize control of indigenous mining operations. Illegal Mining's Prospects The illegal gold rush goes beyond Venezuela and Ecuador. In Brazil, mining has accelerated in the Amazon, devastating massive swaths of rainforest. In the frenzy to reach deposits, the Brazilian miners, known locally as ""garimpeiros,"" invaded indigenous reserves in 2019, setting tracts of land ablaze and even killing a local leader. Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, who promised during his campaign to open up the Amazon to commercial exploitation, has curtailed efforts to fight illegal mining, which is estimated to bring in more than a billion dollars a year, according to a New Yorker report. Neighboring Guyana and Suriname are also rich in gold -- and biodiversity. Illegal mining has already stripped chunks of Suriname's Amazon forest. Criminal groups in Venezuela have set up along the country's border with Guyana, extorting local mining operations. Gold is freely smuggled between the two countries. Smaller and poorer than their neighbors, Guyana and Suriname are ill-prepared to handle incursions from armed actors in search of new mining operations. Smuggling of illegal gold has proliferated across the region. Bolivia has seen gold exports hit record levels in recent years, likely smuggled from other countries. And the islands of the Dutch Caribbean have become a favored transit point for Venezuela's clandestine gold exports. In August, the owner of a tourism complex in southern Bolivar, Venezuela, was identified as coordinator of a trafficking network that laundered gold in the Caribbean nations of Trinidad, Aruba, Curacao, and the Dominican Republic, flying it out from clandestine airstrips. Brazil is also a major exporter of illegal gold. A ring that exported 1.2 tons of illicit gold -- worth more than $55 million -- was taken down in December. The gold was mined in southern Venezuela and moved over the Brazilian border, or sourced from illegal mining operations in the indigenous Yanomami reservation in Brazil's Roraima, which abuts the Venezuela border. Venezuelan gold has also been smuggled directly to the United States. In September, a private jet was detained in Miami carrying $5 million worth of gold in its nose. Gold, unlike drugs, is easily laundered, making it especially valuable to transnational organized crime groups , including drug trafficking syndicates. With world gold prices high and climbing, illegal mining and the illicit gold trade will continue to expand and fuel the interests of transnational organized crime for the foreseeable future.

"Venezuela and Turkey Unite to Profit from Amazonian ""Blood Gold"". Dozens of massacres and a sprawling organized crime structure are behind a recent alliance between the governments of Venezuela and Turkey to extract, refine and market the ""blood gold"" that leaves the Amazon and supplies cross-border illegal economies. During a recent visit to Venezuela, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ratified the leading role of Turkey in the Venezuelan gold business, with exports of the mineral reaching $779 million , and through agreements for the Eurasian country to participate directly in its exploitation. Erdogan also expressed his direct support for Nicolas Maduro to avoid sanctions as part of the executive order signed by President Donald Trump on November 1 with the purpose of preventing the ""plunder of Venezuela's wealth forcorrupt purposes."" On the other hand, the Venezuelan government has recognized that illegal mining activity is growing out of control in the south of the country. In June, Vice President Tareck El Aissami reported the arrest of 28 people as a result of an operation called ""Hands of Metal."" ""These bands had as their modus operandi the purchase of gold from the small miners of the (southeastern) state of Bolivar and then, with organized crime networks, they took that material out of Venezuela,"" El Aissami said. A 2016 report by The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, entitled ""Organized Crime and Illegally Mined Gold in Latin America"", revealed that between 80 and 90 percent of the mineral produced in Venezuela is illegal. Maduro's government has ignored the strengthening of organized crime and the resurgence of violence seen in massacres around the exploitation of gold in Venezuela. Formally, the issue is not on the agenda of negotiations with Erdogan. This allows Venezuela to benefit economically and to, at least partially, sidestep the obstacles put up by the US government, which Maduro and Erdogan both distrust. Venezuela aspired to produce 24 tons of gold in 2018, but it has been forced to act more cautiously after the international sanctions imposed in November. For example, the Bank of England has already resisted the return of Venezuelan gold reserves it holds, valued at $550 million. The United States has also focused on organized crime around illegal mining. When questioning the business between Venezuela and Turkey, Assistant US Treasury Secretary Marshall Billingslea used the term ""blood gold"" to compare the deaths, chaos, and extreme violence that characterize illegal mining in Venezuela with the exploitation of ""blood diamonds"" in Africa. Some official documents support Billingslea's comparison. A report by the Venezuelan scientific police spoke of the massacre of at least 17 miners in the town of Tumeremo in March 2016. This happened within a month of the Orinoco Mining Arc being created in the north of the state of Bolivar; a large-scale mining project spread across 111,843 square kilometers, compromising the ecological balance of the Amazon. Two years after the Tumeremo massacre, the most conservative calculations indicate that over 30 massacres have occurred and the mining underworld has consolidated itself as a real criminal enclave. Similarly to Venezuelan prisons, these gangs rule through violence, often with the direct complicit participation of the government and military. Added to this is the increase in violence in Bolivar, which has the fourth highest homicide rate in Venezuela (113 cases per 100,000 inhabitants), according to the 2017 report of the Venezuelan Violence Observatory (Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia - OVV). Compared to 2016, homicides increased by 70 percent in Bolivar. The municipality of El Callao, the area with the longest tradition in gold mining, stands out in the Observatory's reports as the most violent in the country, with 817 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. To make matters worse, security forces have more deaths to their credit than the criminal gangs linked to illegal mining. Among the most recent and bloody massacres are those that occurred in September 2017, when the army and police murdered 21 people. On February 10, 2018, another 18 people perished after an army incursion. Finally, the presence of the ELN in the area has contributed to the increase in violence and is attributed to the execution of seven miners on October 14, 2018.

How Organized Crime Profits from Deforestation in Colombia. Two years after the signing of a peace deal between the Colombian government and the FARC, Colombia's forests are under siege and experiencing heightened levels of deforestation promoted by various criminal actors looking to expand their illicit revenue streams. The alarming levels of deforestation, with over 200,000 hectares lost in 2017 -- a 23 percent increase from 2016 - have raised the alarm bells of authorities who recently announced the creation of a new specialized team of national prosecutors who will investigate crimes like land grabbing, wood trafficking, illegal mining and drug trafficking in the Amazon region, all of which have led to increased deforestation. These crimes are mainly being carried out by varying criminal outfits such as dissident groups of the largely demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), Los Puntilleros and other smaller groups, according to Colombia's Attorney General's Office. Below, InSight Crime analyzes the three main activities along with the underlying criminal dynamics and criminal actors that, according to the government, are the main drivers behind the deforestation boom. Land Grabbing Prior to the 2016 peace agreement, the FARC guerrilla group had put limits on deforestation in many of the regions they controlled. Rebels sought to halt the expansion of agriculture and cattle ranching in order to better conceal themselves and their drug plantations from the Colombian Air Force. However, since the FARC left their territory, widespread land grabs have occurred in regions previously barely touched due to conflict. In fact, this activity accounts for between 60 to 65 percent of all deforestation in Colombia, according to the Ministry of Environment. The practice usually begins when wealthy landowners invest in large-scale land acquisitions both legally and illegally. These landowners will then finance local community members to cut down vast areas of timber, which are then often used for cattle ranching, Cesar Melendez the Director of the Corporation for the Sustainable Development of the Northern and Eastern Amazon (Corporacion para el Desarrollo Sostenible del Norte y el Oriente Amazonico - CDA), told InSight Crime. But previously FARC-held territory is also increasingly falling under the control of ex-FARC dissident groups that currently operate in around 19 departments across the country. In fact, in some areas, the increase in deforestation can be connected to criminal groups allied with FARC dissidents. These are promoting deforestation and inciting families to move to previously untouched regions and pressure the regional government authorities to give them land titles, said former Minister of the Environment, Luis Gilberto Murillo in a recent interview with El Tiempo. In other cases, criminal groups, like the FARC dissidents, take advantage of deforestation by extorting landowners. For example, the 1st Front Dissidence reportedly charges community members in specific municipalities in the southeastern department of Guaviare an extortion fee of about $320 per hectare logged, along with about $10 per head of cattle. The 1st Front Dissidence has also been responsible for prohibiting regional forest officials from carrying out inspections in Guaviare, and there have even been reports of forest officials being attacked, according to Melendez. Illicit Crops Criminal syndicates are also increasingly promoting deforestation by clear-cutting forests to make room for illicit coca cultivations, a dynamic mirrored by the country's continuous increase in cocaine production. In fact, the Ministry of Environment has suggested that between 20 and 22 percent of deforestation is caused by illicit crop cultivation. Departments such as Narino, Putumayo, and Antioquia have all seen significant upticks in illicit crop cultivation and have also seen similar trends in deforestation. Most recently, the northeastern department of Norte de Santander, more specifically in the northern municipality of Tibu, has been hit hard by deforestation, in part, due to coca cultivation, according to three 2018 Early Warning (Alertas Tempranas) reports by the Institute for Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (Instituto de Hidrologia, Meteorologia y Estudios Ambientales - IDEAM). In 2017 - which is the most recent year for data on coca cultivations in Colombia - Norte de Santander recorded 28,244 hectares of coca, the third highest figure in the country and a 12 percent increase from 2016. Other licit and illicit activities such as legal agriculture, illegal logging for commercialization, informal timber extraction, illegal mining, and cattle ranching also play a role in deforestation within the region. The trend in heightened deforestation to provide room for coca may well continue to grow, as Colombian criminal groups are continually seeking to expand into lucrative markets like Europe and Asia. Furthermore, the growing presence of Mexican cartels trying to guarantee cocaine supply in Colombia's key coca production zones, might also drive increasing cultivation. Illegal Mining Illegal mining continues to serve as a key source of illegal profits and as an efficient money-laundering method for criminal groups operating across the country. And according to the Colombian government, it is the third most important driver of deforestation nationally, representing around 8 percent of all deforestation. In general, criminal groups promote widespread deforestation via illegal mining in two ways. The first is simply clear-cutting large areas of forest to construct new mining areas. Many of these mines have become a principal source of illicit income for organized crime, and are either directly controlled by criminal groups or are extorted by them. The department of Choco serves as an example of this phenomenon. In the municipalities of Union Panamericana, Istmina, Condoto, Opogodo and Novita along the San Juan River, 90 percent of the large-scale gold and platinum mining carried out in part by Brazilian nationals is said to be illegal, according to Yoileth Mosquera, the Deputy Director of Sustainable Development for the department's environmental authority (Corporacion Autonoma Regional para el Desarrollo Sostenible del Choco - CODECHOCO), who spoke to InSight Crime. This is having a devastating effect on the region's forests. The increasing trend in deforestation specifically caused by illegal mining may also persist for some time, as Colombian organized crime groups continue to diversify their criminal portfolios.

"Attacks on Multinationals in Colombia: Signs of New Criminal Era. A series of attacks on multinational companies operating in Colombia could indicate that armed groups are shedding discipline for increased criminal gains, in a new era of organized crime in the country. On September 20, three geologists from Canadian mining company Continental Gold were killed in the town of Yarumal, Antioquia department. Armed men -- allegedly from the 36th Front dissident group of the now largely demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) -- attacked a camp where 11 geologists were sleeping. The experts had been performing mining exploration activities in the area. The attack left three people dead and three injured. Several theories about the event emerged. Authorities stated that the 36th Front dissidents -- which abandoned the FARC peace process and are under the command of Ricardo Abel Ayala, alias ""Cabuyo"" -- and the National Liberation Army (Ejercito Nacional de Liberacion - ELN) guerrilla group, formed an alliance to commit the attack. But the ELN publicly denied these allegations and stated that it does not have a presence in the area. Media outlets have reported that yet another criminal group, the Urabenos, has also been investigated for involvement in the attack, but they too have denied responsibility. Two weeks earlier, on September 5, Continental Gold was the target of another attack in the Antioquian town of Buritica, where the company runs its biggest mining operation. The perpetrators attacked two Continental Gold engineers, killing Oscar Alarcon and injuring his colleague. Police arrested four Urabenos members as suspects. More recently, alleged members of the same group kidnapped 17 officials from multinational utility company Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM) in Zaragoza, Antioquia, according to the Colombian army, which rescued the hostages on September 25. One of the victims told newspaper El Tiempo that the group kept them intimidated for three days in an effort to extort money from EPM. The Urabenos denied involvement. These three cases represent a fight against legality -- or its exploitation -- by Colombian groups who are increasingly losing a disciplined and ideological leadership. Antioquia has witnessed the criminal landscape shift since the FARC guerrillas demobilized. Various actors are seeking to strengthen their share in the illegal markets such as coca farming and illegal gold mining. Legal businesses like Continental Gold and other powerful entities pose a threat to these criminal groups. When they enter territories with a history of conflict -- which may have seemed more feasible following the FARC's exit -- they not only consume resources that feed criminal actors, like gold, but also often bring increased government attention and security force presence. This was the case in Buritica , where the Urabenos lost a major share of their criminal gains after Continental Gold and Colombian authorities took action. Moreover, the criminal shake-up provoked by the FARC's exit has meant that emerging groups like the guerrilla group's dissidents must reestablish territorial control. The attack at Yarumal may have done more than send a message to Continental Gold. It could also be an attempt by the small 36th Front dissidence to demonstrate its military strength and willingness to turn to violence. The rise of lower-level dissident guerrilla leaders to top roles in their own criminal organizations means that they no longer report to a historical hierarchy, and are less obligated to embrace discipline. Internal fractures can also be seen in the Urabenos, especially following to the fall of key bosses and massive seizures against them. This double blow to the group's leadership and finances seems to have reduced the remaining bosses' control over some of their factions, while these increasingly seek out alternative economies such as extortion. With the Colombian government and the FARC's historic peace agreement, the foreign investors and companies some hoped would flock to the country may be at risk due to the volatile scenario created by the remaining criminal groups. And it can only be assumed that they will continue to fight to protect their own interests. * This article was written with assistance from InSight Crime's Colombian Organized Crime Observatory ."	0	0	0	1	0	1	0
"Mining Massacre Signals ELN Expansion Into Venezuela. The recent massacre of seven people in one of Venezuela's mining regions may confirm that the Colombia guerrilla group ELN is expanding its criminal activities into the south of Venezuela, encroaching on the gold mining territory of local mafias. On October 14 on the border with Guyana, alleged members of the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) are believed to have ambushed a group of miners in the town of El Bochinche, located in the municipality of Sifontes in Bolivar state. The first reports came from six miners who survived the attack. Only later did Venezuelan armed forces discover seven bodies near the mine, according to media outlet El Pitazo. All of the victims whose bodies were recovered had been shot execution-style. Local residents reported 16 disappearances. So far, the Venezuelan government has not offered an official version of events. There have been repeated massacres in the mining areas of Bolivar state, mostly due to rivalries between criminal gangs called either ""syndicates"" (sindicatos) or ""pranatos,"" the latter of which is a type of mafia that originated in Venezuela's prison system and whose leaders are called "" pranes ."" Mining pranatos have successfully established themselves and now set the standard for all illegal businesses thriving on the unchecked pilfering of Venezuela's mineral deposits. What is different about this incident is the alleged role of the ELN. Bolivar's representative in the National Assembly, Americo De Grazia , was one of the first to confirm it. ""The indigenous and mining communities have been reporting the presence of the ELN in El Bochinche to us since November 2017,"" he told InSight Crime. Colombian President Ivan Duque has also mentioned the likelihood of the ELN transferring some of its criminal enclaves to Venezuelan territory -- with the "" support "" of Nicolas Maduro's government. This week, he shut down any possibility of dialogue with the guerrilla group if their criminal activities continue. While it is believed that the ELN has expanded into Venezuelan territory, it remains difficult to determine just how well established it is. But its alleged presence more than 1,500 kilometers from the Colombian border could mean it is poised to enter into another war -- this time for gold -- and its first battles would be with the criminal gangs operating along the borders with Guyana and Brazil. The ELN could be making headway into Venezuela in search of new opportunities to expand its criminal economies. Congressman De Grazia explained that approximately 100 armed and uniformed members of the ELN have allegedly settled in El Bochinche, where the latest attack on miners took place. ""They seized the Hermanos Hernandez logging operation and installed a camp there,"" he added. De Grazia also alleged that the ELN and government authorities in the mining areas have formed an alliance as part of a corruption network that reaches all the way to Caracas and involves top military and civil officials. ""The government of President Nicolas Maduro is very satisfied with the work the ELN has done. They appreciate that they've displaced the pranatos in controlling illegal mining. The government thinks of the ELN as serious people with whom they can negotiate. That's why they're acting with impunity. They moved towards Cedeno [a municipality in Bolivar state] and took over the coltan and diamond mining. Now for about a year we've seen them fighting over the gold mines at the other end of the country, on the border with Guyana,"" the politician told InSight Crime. Javier Tarazona, director of non-governmental organization Fundaredes, has been following the ELN's expansion into Venezuela. He agrees with De Grazia regarding the potential shift in ""criminal governments"" in the country's mining regions. ""The government has lost control of the mining pranato and is appealing to the greater fire power that the ELN may have. It's operating as an armed branch of the ruling party to keep the illegal mining profits coming in,"" Tarazone said. Illegal mining is a criminal economy that the ELN has already been exploiting in Colombian territory. The current situation in Venezuela -- in part because authorities seem to lack the will to intervene -- makes it easier for the group to fill its coffers and strengthen its criminal structures with the resources it gets from gold mining. Add to this the pressure the Colombian government is putting on the guerrilla group by ending the ceasefire, and seeking refuge on the other side of the border may seem like an attractive option for the ELN now more than ever."	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
"Peru Authorities Struggle to Combat Illegal Mining as Deforestation Continues. Peru has lost hundreds of hectares of rainforests to illegal mining in recent months, a reminder of the environmental damage caused by the illegal practice and the government's inability to address the issue. An estimated 460 hectares of tropical rainforest in Peru's southwestern Madre de Dios department have been lost to illegal mining between September 2016 and May this year, reported El Comercio. The area is part of a buffer zone that protects the Tambopata national reserve, and has long been targeted by illegal miners for its gold deposits. According to Amazon Conservation Association (ACA) researcher Matt Finer, the buffer zone has lost an estimated 4,440 hectares since 2012 to illicit mining. ""May these [deforestation] figures help to shed light on the consequences the new law would bring"" to the region, Finer was reported by El Comercio as saying. In March this year, conservative Popular Power (Fuerza Popular) congresswoman Alejandra Aramayo presented a law that aims to remove illegal mining from the activities Peruvian authorities target as organized crime. The move has been subject to debate , with several other members of Congress arguing it favours illegal miners and incentivizes the criminal activity. Up to 50 percent of the local economy in Madre de Dios may be based on illegal mining. Peru's Natural Reserves Service (Servicio Nacional de Areas Naturales Protegidas - SERNAP) has already requested tougher controls in the buffer zone. According to Jose Nieto, director of SERNAP's protected areas unit, joint operations by the marines, police, the Attorney General's Office and SERNAP led to a decrease in illegal mining in the Tombopata reserve, but deforestation still plagues the region. The recent deforestation figures in Madre de Dios highlight not only the environmental damage caused by illegal mining, but also the inability of the government to stop these harmful illicit activities. Deforestation is only one of the many environmental challenges linked to the illicit extraction of minerals. A 2016 report by Peru's National Civil Defense Institute (Instituto Nacional de Defensa Civil - INDECI) found that several hundred Madre de Dios inhabitants may be exposed to dangerous levels of mercury, a toxic metal often used in illicit extraction of gold. And in May 2016, the Peruvian government announced a 60-day state of emergency in the department due to mercury contamination linked to illegal mining. Authorities in Peru have long battled against illegal mining in the country. The government introduced laws designed to step up investigations into alleged gold smugglers and money laundering linked with mining, and also promoted the formalization of illegal miners in the Madre de Dios department. But the staggering deforestation figures are a reminder that these efforts are yet to yield the desired results. Part of the difficulties encountered by authorities owe to the vast profits the illegal practice generates. A report by the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime found that while the wholesale price of cocaine is $2,000 per kilogram, a kilogram of gold is worth $35,000. In addition, the economic importance of the illicit gold trade in the area has also proven to be an obstacle to anti-illegal mining efforts. Many inhabitants of the Madre de Dios department, including governor Luis Otsuka, opposed the state of emergency declared in May last year, likely as a result of many citizens' dependence on this activity for their livelihoods."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"70% of Colombia Mining is Illegal: Study. A multi-year investigation has revealed that up to 70 percent of mining in Colombia is illegal, a statistic that brings home the importance of tackling this criminal industry as part of the country's ongoing peace-building process. The figures, accessed by El Tiempo , come from a five-volume publication by Colombia's Externado University , which took 93 investigators two and a half years to complete. According to El Tiempo, it is considered to be the most in-depth investigation of its kind in Colombia. Externado President Juan Carlos Henao said the main issues with illegal mining are financial, since illegally extracted minerals cannot be taxed, and environmental, given that 180 metric tons of mercury that are produced as waste each year, El Tiempo reported. Henao also said this criminal industry involving multiple illegal armed actors will be an important challenge for ""post-conflict"" Colombia. The Colombian government and rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) reached an agreement in late June on a bilateral ceasefire, bringing the two sides closer to a final peace agreement. Academic researchers told El Tiempo that tackling the industry will require a long-term change in mentality within mining communities, as well as educating local officials about appropriate law enforcement responses. The university's figures are further indication that illegal mining will be one Colombia's greatest security challenges should the government and FARC succeed in signing a final peace agreement. The FARC have deep ties to the illegal mining industry, which is one of the guerrilla group's principal source of illicit income. The illegal mining sector has become a major revenue generator for various other illegal armed groups as well. It is an industry that could be worth $2.4 billion a year, according to government estimates , and last year President Juan Manuel Santos suggested criminal mining is more lucrative than drug trafficking. SEE ALSO : Coverage of FARC Peace Given these steep profit margins, it comes as little surprise that Colombian groups are already fighting for control of mining areas that the FARC will presumably abandon once a peace deal is reached, most notably in the departments of Antioquia and Choco. One such group is the Urabenos, the country's most powerful criminal organization. The Urabenos have most recently been linked to the assassination of at least 17 community leaders in the municipality of El Bagre, Antioquia, over the past six months alone. El Bagre is both an illegal mining and coca-growing hub , and has already been affected by territorial clashes between the Urabenos and the FARC."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Colombia: From Coca Cultivation to Gold Mining and Back. It was one of the few successful drug crop substitutions in Colombia's history -- albeit one led by armed groups and an underground economy. But now, the migration from coca cultivation to illegal gold mining in the north of the country has been thrown into reverse, and regions where cocaine production was in decline are witnessing a coca revival. The latest coca survey carried out by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) showed a huge increase in coca cultivation in Colombia in 2014, a rise researchers attributed to a complex interplay of evolving conditions. However, even the 44 percent overall rise was dwarfed by the increase in the northern province of Antioquia, where cultivation leapt 131 percent. And for those in the epicenter of Antioquian production -- the sub-region of Bajo Cauca -- there was one reason above all: the bursting of the illegal gold mining bubble. ""A lot of people left behind the cocaine and coca business to get involved in mining,"" said Ramiro Restrepo, the president of the Bajo Cauca Miners Association. ""And now it is the reverse, gold has gone down and a lot of people are saying they'd be better off back where they were, that coca is the only thing that's profitable."" This illicit labor migration is largely driven by market forces, but those in the region say it is also a direct result of the state's policies. And while these policies may have helped curb the expansion of the illegal mining trade, the return to coca shows they have done little to break the vicious circle of poverty and criminal economies that afflicts regions such as Bajo Cauca. A Criminal Crop Substitution Consisting of six municipalities in the north of Antioquia, Bajo Cauca is one of many areas in Colombia cursed by its resource wealth and fertile lands. The isolated hills on the edges of the region have rich soil and the perfect climate for growing coca, while the river valleys below contain a wealth of gold. These resources -- along with Bajo Cauca's strategic location as a corridor to move drugs to coastal dispatch points -- have long attracted illegal armed groups. For the last two decades, paramilitaries and their criminalized successors have occupied most of the central zone and urban centers, while guerrilla insurgents prowl the outer mountains, jungles and coca fields. A lot of people left behind the cocaine and coca business to get involved in mining."" According to the UNODC, coca cultivation in Antioquia reached a peak of 9,926 hectares in 2007, with Bajo Cauca at the heart of the trade. In 2008 it began a decline, reaching a low of just 991 hectares in 2013. As coca production fell, the region's long established informal mining sector began to grow rapidly, fueled by a surge in international gold prices , which leapt from $731.75 per ounce in 2008 to a high of $1,889.7 in 2011. The work was not as reliable as coca farming, but promised much higher returns for those willing to chance their hand. At the time, it also promised less risk of persecution, with security forces far more concerned with eradicating coca than preventing mining. Armed groups quickly realized the boom in informal mining represented a new opportunity to diversify their criminal revenue streams, all they had to do was intimidate miners into paying what is known in Colombia as ""the vaccination"" -- extortion fees. However, their interest was not limited to extortion. The region's guerrillas and narco-paramilitaries also saw advantages to operating in an economy caught between the legal and the illegal, a murky world where irritations such as formal land titles, environmental licenses and proof of origin requirements were largely absent. ""Mining favors them in the sense that it is part legal and part illegal, and they shield themselves and camouflage themselves behind the gold panners and other miners,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Luis Leon, who leads anti-mining operations in the Bajo Cauca Carabineros. While the easy money of extortion remained their main interest, the armed groups also began to infiltrate and directly exploit the informal sector to extract even more profits and to launder their drug money. According to local police, they began to invest in mining machinery to rent out or to send to work productive spots. They also stepped up their involvement in running mines, not only charging the ""vaccination"" but also regulating the mines and using frontmen as administrators. ""This is the answer of these criminals, there is stricter control over illegal mining so they say they are going to return to illegal crops."" ""They had the money to buy machines and to take over certain territories,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Javier Guerrero, Commander of the Bajo Cauca police division. ""By investing money in machines, workers and technology they began to turn their hand to gold mining."" In Bajo Cauca, all three of Colombia's main armed groups -- the insurgents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and their smaller relations in the National Liberation Army (ELN), and the narco-paramilitaries known as the Urabenos -- now profit from the mining trade. The Counter-Migration The most recent coca stats confirm a trend that has long been popular knowledge in Antioquia; the migration from coca to gold is now in reverse. In 2014, the UNODC registered more than double the year's previous total of hectares cultivated, rising to 2,293. The move back to coca from mining is largely influenced by international gold prices, which have fallen 37 percent since their 2011 high. In an industry such as mining, where overheads can be high and results are never guaranteed, such price fluctuations can savage profit margins, driving miners to seek work elsewhere and forcing criminal groups to reassess their economic priorities. However, gold prices still stand at around $1,200 an ounce -- returning to levels last seen in mid-2010, when the criminal mining boom was already in an upward swing and coca cultivation in Antioquia nearly halfway through its seven year decline. This is not just a story of diminishing returns, say miners, security forces, and local authorities in Bajo Cauca, but also one of increased risks from the state's crack down on the informal mining sector. {module Colombia Gold Gallery} Photo Credit: James Bargent and Michael Norby Over the last two years, Colombia has stepped up its efforts to tackle illegal mining exponentially, and the results are clear to see. According to Ministry of Defense figures obtained by El Tiempo , in 2014 security forces seized 739 kilos of suspect gold, compared to 11 kilos the year before and just three in 2011, when prices were at their peak. They also confiscated or destroyed 542 machines -- compared to 237 in 2013 -- arrested 1,757 people and closed down 655 mines. ""The issues of control of machines and the law that allows us to establish the criminal connections between mines and organized crime groups has hit these groups really hard,"" said Lt Colonel Guerrero. ""This has slowed their capacity to hide their money [in the mining sector]."" This has also been a decisive factor in the migration from gold to coca, he added. ""This is the answer of these criminals, there is stricter control over illegal mining so they say they are going to return to illegal crops,"" he said. In its wars against both coca and illegal mining, the authorities have relentlessly pursued the bottom rung of the supply chain, bringing short term success. However, the move back to coca is not necessarily driven by orders from the leaders of armed groups concerned about cash flows. The labor dynamic of both illegal mining and coca cultivation means those at the bottom of the chain, who pick the coca and sift the gold, are not members of armed groups but itinerant workers in the only economies in town. And many of those workers in the mining sector feel unfairly and indiscriminately targeted by the security forces -- making coca a more attractive option. ""They come and they blow up [the machines], close the mines, take the people away and prosecute them,"" said one miner, who did not want to be named. ""Imagine that, a person trying to earn their living and they become the same as a criminal."" The police say these operations are exhaustively investigated and carefully targeted. However, littered around the site near where the miner works is striking evidence this is not always the case; the charred remains of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of mining equipment sinking into the mud. The equipment belongs to a mine taking part in a pilot formalization program. The informal mining sector is also being squeezed at the point of sale. Over the last year, the government has introduced a spate of new rules and regulations designed to restrict the flow of illegal gold. ""A lot of gold buyers have closed down because they don't have these legal documents,"" said one gold trader in the town of Caucasia, who did not want to be identified. ""There are only a few that you see completely open and that are operating within the legal requirements the government is demanding."" Although miners have found ways to skirt restrictions -- most commonly by selling to a middle man who has secured the right documents or by claiming the gold is a product of artesanal mining instead of mechanized -- this in itself is an additional cost and risk. The illegal mining boom in Bajo Cauca is far from over; there remain up to 1,100 mining operations in the region directly employing an estimated 45,000 people, according to the miners association. But there is a growing sense that the bubble may have burst. Also growing is the sense of failure emerging out of success in Colombia's anti-illegal mining campaign -- the same feeling that has haunted Colombia's efforts to eradicate coca for decades. In its wars against both coca and illegal mining, the authorities have relentlessly pursued the bottom rung of the supply chain, bringing short term success. But the underlying conditions of poverty, lack of opportunity and the control of armed groups in areas rich in coca and gold have remained unaddressed -- and as long as they do, illegal economies will continue to fill the gaps."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Peru Tackles Money Laundering via Currency Exchange. Peru's recent approval of fairly rudimentary monitoring of currency exchange services is one sign of how far the country has to go in its anti-money laundering efforts. As part of the government's ongoing efforts to combat money laundering, on October 28 Peru's Superintendent of Banking and Insurance (SBS) approved regulations requiring currency ""exchange houses"" to register clients conducting transactions of $5,000 or greater value. Those making transactions valued between $200 and $5,000 will be required to show identification. Additionally, ""high risk"" clients, such as non-Peruvians and unregistered businesses, will be subject to extra scrutiny. Information on transactions of $5,000 or greater will periodically be sent to the SBS's Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF) for review. The regulation is set to go into effect March 1, 2016. When it comes to money laundering, Peruvian officials seem aware they have a serious problem on their hands. In recent years, Peru's growing economy and expanding service industry has opened vulnerabilities for criminal groups to exploit in order to legitimize illicitly-earned gains. Peru's move towards stricter oversight of currency exchange is a positive development. Nonetheless, it is a rather rudimentary step, indicating how far the country has to go towards establishing a comprehensive and effective anti-money laundering policy. (As recently as 2012, Peru's justice minister admitted the country had zero convictions for money laundering.) Recent figures shed light on the potential scale of money laundering within Peru. According to El Comercio , since 2010 the SBS has registered over 3,000 transactions linked to money laundering and financing of terrorism. The UIF reportedly estimates the amount of money moved in these suspicious transactions amounts to more than $8 billion. The SBS figures also suggest that the government would do well to target money laundering connected to illegal gold mining. As El Comercio reported, the SBS believes that 44 percent of suspicious financial transactions since 2010 -- a figure that amounts to $4.35 billion -- are linked to gold mining. In contrast, 31 percent were connected to drug trafficking ($3.11 billion) and 7 percent to corruption ($716 million). Peru's illegal gold trade is worth an estimated $3 billion a year , and, as the SBS numbers suggest, could now be bringing in bigger profits than the drug trade ."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Mining Company Admits to Relationship with Mexico Organized Crime. The head of a Canadian mining company has admitted to interacting with Mexico criminal groups in order to facilitate mining operations, illustrating a common regional dynamic that is rarely discussed publicly. On April 9, in an interview with Canada's Business News Network, Rob McEwen -- the president and chairman of Toronto-based McEwen Mining Inc. -- said his company has a ""good relationship"" with drug cartels in Mexico's Sinaloa state, reported The Associated Press. Discussing how violence and criminal groups affect his company's work in Mexico, McEwen said, ""If we want to go explore somewhere you ask [the cartels] and they tell you, 'No.' But then they'll say 'Come back,' in a couple of weeks; 'We've finished what we're doing.'"" The interview took place two days after the theft of 900 kilos of gold-bearing concentrate, which contained around 7,000 ounces of gold, from the company's El Gallo 1 mine in the Sinaloa municipality of Mocorito. The value of the stolen gold has been estimated at around $8.4 million. According to McEwen, eight heavily armed thieves entered the mining installation in a ""very well planned"" heist. The robbers overpowered two employees, taking their keys to access the complex, and used at least two vehicles to remove the gold from the site. Local authorities suspect the involvement of current or former workers in the robbery, especially given that the vault door had been left open overnight and the robbery was not immediately reported to police. Following the theft, Manuel Reyes -- president of the Mexican Association of Mining, Metallurgical, and Geological Engineers (AIMMGM) -- echoed McEwen's statements, acknowledging that, ""We ask the mafia for permission, the organized crime groups, and we are able to [operate]. Things get resolved because there are negotiations by the companies."" Although McEwen did not admit to paying extortion fees to criminal groups, his acknowledgement that his company coordinates with organized crime is unusual. While major companies throughout Latin America pay extortion fees in order to protect their employees and operations, few readily admit to doing so. Nonetheless, evidence of such behavior has been witnessed in Colombia , where mining operations and oil companies are major targets for extortion carried out by illegal armed groups. In Mexico, the extortion of mining companies has become a common practice as criminal groups diversify their revenue streams, resulting in massive losses for the country's mining industry. According to The Wall Street Journal, there has been a recent spike in security problems for mining companies and their employees in Mexico in the form of kidnappings and extortion, which the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said was making Mexico less attractive for investors. Indeed, while groups like the Zetas and the Knights Templar are more commonly associated with extorting the mining sector, there is no reason to think the Sinaloa Cartel has not also sought to profit from Mexico's lucrative mining industry."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Colombia Captures Coltan Czar Linked to FARC. Authorities in Colombia have captured a key operative who facilitated the sale of coltan and uranium for the FARC and ELN guerrilla groups, in a case highlighting the role corrupt officials play in the lucrative illegal mining industry. In a joint operation carried out by the Colombian Navy and the investigative unit of the Attorney General's Office, authorities arrested Juan Jose Rivera Suarez, known as the ""czar of coltan,"" reported El Tiempo. According to investigators, Rivera used a legal company to export shipments of coltan and other minerals that were illegally mined in protected indigenous reserves. The minerals were sent to the United States, where the coltan was used in computer and appliance factories. Witness testimony and communications interceptions indicate that Rivera's network had a number of local and departmental government officials and members of security forces on its payroll. During the operation to capture Rivera, authorities seized 375 kilos of minerals, including uranium, which investigators believe was purchased in Venezuela and destined for the United States. Authorities are investigating alleged links between US companies and Rivera's criminal network, reported El Espectador. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) are involved in coltan mining in both eastern Colombia and Venezuela, and use the mineral to finance their insurgency. As demonstrated by Rivera's case, the FARC depend on intermediaries and corrupt public officials to export the mineral, which is used to manufacture electronic devices. In 2011, the former director of Colombia's police stated that the Sinaloa Cartel was working with the FARC to mine and commercialize coltan. According to documents seized from the camp of deceased FARC leader Raul Reyes, the FARC are also involved in uranium trafficking. This is especially troubling because uranium can be used to create nuclear bombs, and the FARC could potentially be selling the material to terrorist groups. The National Liberation Army (ELN) also generate revenue through illegal mining , mainly by charging miners to work and bring mining machinery into ELN territory."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Airport Controls Unlikely to Stem Flow of Illegal Gold From Peru. Special security teams tasked with catching contraband gold smuggling will be placed in five airports in Peru , though the efficiency of gold laundering inside the country means the initiative will likely have limited impact on the billion dollar trade. From February 21, teams formed of police and officials from Peru's Public Ministry will start operations in Lima, Arequipa, Cusco, Juliaca and Madre de Dios airports, reported El Comercio. The teams' mission will be detecting the transport of illegally sourced gold and other minerals out of the country. Senior mining official Daniel Urresti said the teams would ""hit the illegal mining trade hard because they will make the transport chain more complicated. The objective is to raise the transport costs so that mining ceases to be a profitable business."" The government also plans to create a register of buyers of cyanide and mercury, two chemicals used in the gold mining process. Peru's illegal gold mining industry is huge, generating as much as $3 billion a year -- constituting about a fifth of all Peruvian gold exports. Urresti estimates that 80 percent of illegally mined gold leaves via the country's airports. This estimate is probably about right, making these teams a step in the right direction, according to Quinn Kepes, a US researcher who last year completed extensive fieldwork investigating Peru's illegal gold trade. However a large proportion of that gold is laundered -- given fake receipts guaranteeing it was sourced from legal mining concessions -- before it reaches the airport, meaning formal companies export large quantities of illegally sourced gold through official channels. For instance, Universal Metal Trading, known to be one of Peru's major exporters of illegal gold, transported more than 19 tons of gold to Switzerland in 2011 via the airline KLM, according to government figures. ""In many cases, by the time the gold is making its way out of the country, it is already being passed off as 'legal,'"" said Kepes. Inspections by the teams will only catch gold that has not been provided with fake receipts, and will certainly not be able to affect the profitability of the illegal supply chain as hoped by Urresti. To do that would require catching the ""acopiadores"" (gold brokers who make the fake receipts), and to do so would require cracking down on corruption among regional officials and security forces, which is an immense task. In any case, as pointed out by Kepes, ""Just like drugs, the smugglers will adapt, so what's really needed is to get to the source -- where the [illegal gold] is produced and extracted."""	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Mexico Investigates Mining Ties to Organized Crime. Citing links to organized crime, t he Attorney General's Office (PGR) in Mexico has frozen the accounts of 12 mining companies so far this year, underscoring how criminal groups may be moving to diversify their criminal portfolios. El Siglo de Torreon reported on January 25 that investigations into the possible drug trafficking ties of mining companies in Coahuila state were underway. The 12 businesses are also being investigated for money laundering, tax evasion and breach of federal regulations. According to Justice in Mexico Coahuila is Mexico's biggest mining state and a key producer of coal; the state supplies Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission with over 3 million tons of coal annually. As Justice in Mexico notes, the allegations of organized crime ties to mining in Coahuila state first emerged in October last year when the state's former governor, Humberto Moreira, declared that the then recently killed leader of the Zetas , Humberto Lazcano, alias "" Z-3 ,""had run coal mining operations there. Details on the current investigations have not been released, so it is unknown if any of the companies under investigation are suspected of ties to the Zetas. As well as allegations of running their own mining operations, Mexico's criminal groups -- among them the Gulf Cartel and Knights Templar -- have been accused of extorting mines, charging them up to $37,000 a month for the right to operate in the gang's territory. While organized crime may be extending its reach into the Mexican mining business, criminal involvement appears to be some way off that seen in Colombia. There, drug trafficking groups and leftist guerrilla organizations have been found to both extort and run their own illegal gold mines, and may be doing so in half of the country, according to Colombian police. What's more, the practice has become so lucrative in certain areas -- notably in northern Antioquia -- that it has likely overtaken the drug trade as the primary source of income for criminal gangs. Illegal mining in Mexico is certainly a long way off reaching this level. However, as authorities continue to increase pressure on drug trafficking operations, it would be unsurprising if the country's larger, more sophisticated gangs move to diversify their sources of revenue further."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Zetas Linked to Coal Mining in North Mexico. A former governor and PRI leader in Mexico has claimed that the Zetas have broadened their activities to include coal mining in the northern state of Coahuila, although evidence for this allegation is scarce. In an October 26 press conference , former governor and ex-leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Humberto Moreira told reporters that recently-killed Zetas leader Heriberto "" Z-3 "" Lazcano had run illegal coal mining ventures in Coahuila before his death. According to Moreira, who served as governor of Coahuila from 2005 to 2011, Lazcano's involvement in illegal mining has been an ""open secret"" in the state for years, and the Zeta leader even sold coal to the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE). Moreira also claimed that Lazcano was well-known for mining in the municipality of Progreso, where he was killed. ""[Lazcano] would go to the store to buy soda and chips. He did not walk around armed or anything; he was a miner. It may seem unbelieveable, but there it is,"" the former governor said. Moreira's statements come less than a month after his son was murdered, allegedly by Zetas hitmen. The claims about Heriberto Lazcano's mining ventures fit with increasing concern in Mexico about the influence of organized crime on mining. With the government cracking down on drug trafficking, Mexican cartels are looking to the country's growing mining industry for revenue. Much of this has taken place in Coahuila, as it is Mexico's top mining state. In May, authorities discovered that criminal gangs had been directly running illegal coal mines in the state. Moreira's theory would explain Lazcano's apparent lack of concern for his security when he was killed. As crime analyst Alejandro Hope has pointed out , the fact that he was relatively lightly armed and had only minimal protection when he was killed is puzzling. But if he had long been passing himself off as the owner of a mining company in Coahuila, he may have been in the habit of traveling with little security."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
InSight Map: Conflict and Colombias Gold Rush. A report from the New York Times published Friday examines the way that gold mining in northern Colombia, particularly the department of Antioquia, is providing an extra source of funds for drug-trafficking organizations. InSight takes a closer look at the dynamics of the conflict in the key gold-producing regions of Anori and Amalfi. The northern department of Antioquia is the hub of Colombia's current gold rush. As previously detailed by InSight , with international gold prices reaching record highs, licensed and unlicensed miners are increasingly moving into the area -- accompanied by criminal interests. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ) in particular, have grown reliant on funds extorted from local gold miners. During two trips to the region in March and July 2010, InSight learned that the FARC's 36th Front typically charge between three and eight million pesos (between about $1,650 and $4,500) for each bulldozer that enters the territory. Those who don't pay up have their equipment attacked and destroyed by the rebels. The income from gold mining has provided the FARC's 36th Front with a hefty supplement to their drug trafficking activities. Other criminal groups, including the Urabenos and the Paisas , are thought to control gold mines in Antioquia's Bajo Cauca region, where an estimated 23 tons of gold are thought to be illegally extracted each year. In the map below, InSight highlights the strategic locations of the various criminal interests operating in Amalfi and Anori, the municipalities which serve as the 36th Front's stronghold.

"Verdad Abierta on Gold Mining and Conflict. Colombian publications Verdad Abierta website and its partner Semana magazine have published an article looking at the ways unlicensed gold mining is feeding the armed conflict in Northern Antioquia, Colombia. In the area known as Bajo Cauca, miners could be extracting up to 28 tons of gold each year, an industry worth billions of pesos thanks to record gold prices on the global market. InSight visited this area in July and found it to be very similar to the ""Wild West"" described by Verdad Abierta. Many of Colombia's neo-paramilitary groups - the Rastrojos, the Urabenos, the Paisas and the Oficina de Envigado - all have interests in the area and are looking to expand into mining. The 36th Front of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) is also very active here, and charges tax on every bulldozer that enters their territory. Verdad Abierta estimates there are 2,000 bulldozers within a territory of 8,500 squared kilometers along Bajo Cauca's rivers. During InSigh Crime's visit, we counted 25 in a 10 kilometer radius alone, representing some pretty hefty profits for the 36th Front. Multiple sources confirmed to Insight that the average tax charged is between three and eight million pesos (between about $1,650 and $4,500) per machine. Northern Antioquia has long been a key region Colombia's conflict. Not only did the National Liberation Army (ELN) first appear here, but so did Carlos Castano's first paramilitary armies. There were dense fields of coca cultivations here (and still are, especially in the northern part of the Anori province), but farmers were hit hard by a long campaign of aerial and manual eradication. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Antioquia's coca cultivations dropped from 10,000 hectares to 4,500 between 2008 and 2009. Many coca farmers used to supplement their income by panning the rivers for gold during the summers, but now rely almost totally on mining to survive. However it now looks like the Santos administration is prepared to take a more active role in ""legitimizing"" the mining industry. Security forces announced that in September, they have shut down 40 unlicensed mines operating in the Cordoba province, an action repeated by police in the more southerly Valle del Cauca province. There have also been recent reports that drug kingpin Daniel Barrera Barrera, alias El Loco, also collects income from mines across the country, and even jailed paramilitary leader Carlos Mario Jimenez, alias Macaco , is thought to control a mine in Bajo Cauca. These kinds of actions are probably only going to increase in the future, perhaps even in Bajo Cauca, and we will also probably see more gold mining concession sold to Colombian and multi-national companies.

"Chiles Copper Robbing Epidemic Likely Fueled by China Demand. The seizure of tons of stolen copper near Santiago, Chile -- set to be sent illegally to China -- suggests that increasingly daring robberies may be fueled by the Asian powerhouse's thirst for the mineral. During an operation on January 13, over 50 tons of copper cables were seized from a company in Lampa, north of Santiago, with an estimated value of $250 million, Chile's investigative police (Policia de Investigaciones de Chile - PDI) announced on Twitter. The copper was to be smuggled to China as shown by falsified documentation found during the raid, PDI detective Jorge Sanchez told the press. SEE ALSO : Chile News and Profile This is but the latest in an increasing string of copper thefts throughout Chile, the largest copper producer in the world. In October, over 10 tons of stolen copper, worth an estimated $55 million, was recovered by police near Antofagasta in northern Chile, the local Attorney General's Office announced. More daringly, the country has also seen a number of attacks on trains carrying copper extracted from remote Chilean mines in the Andes or the Atacama desert. In 2015, just one attack on a copper train was reported but this shot up to 46 in 2018, railway company Grupo FCAB told Bloomberg. Chile created a special police unit in February 2019 dedicated to fighting copper theft. ""They (the gangs) can attack a train anywhere simply by placing obstacles on the tracks. They climb up, cut the supports holding the cathodes and load them up onto trucks specially adapted to take the weight,"" the unit's director Luis Millapan told Bloomberg. ""They use high-frequency radios and special clothing to withstand the frozen temperatures of the desert and they know the area like the back of their hand."" The discovery of a China-bound shipment of contraband may provide a missing piece to reveal the full picture of Chile's copper theft puzzle. There is no evidence currently linking China to Chile's other copper robberies but the country has a track record of soaking up global copper production, both legally and illegally. China is Chile's main trading partner and copper made up 76 percent of the South American's country exports to China in 2018, although Peru now leads the list of top providers. In 2015, China received over $50 million worth of copper concentrates from Peru which, while legally mined, contained arsenic levels above China's own legal norms, Metal Bulletin announced. In 2017, China was embroiled in a diplomatic standoff with Zambia after 31 Chinese citizens were arrested in the African country for illegal copper mining, Reuters reported. This was just one in a string of incidents surrounding Chinese investment in Zambia's copper industry, according to Quartz. And trade frictions may also be contributing to an increase in illegal copper from Chile to China. In 2019, trade frictions led exports of copper cathodes between the two countries to drop by 20.7 percent, Chile's undersecretary for international economic relations, Rodrigo Yanez, told China's state-owned press agency, Xinhua. China has also been cracking down on imports of copper scrap, partly to protect its own domestic copper industry, and to receive only high-quality copper material from abroad, which is also likely driving up demand for the illegally sourced metal."	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
"Colombia-Venezuela Border Reopens, But Hidden Trails Still Hotspots. The reopening of a major Colombia-Venezuela border crossing is an important step to stop Venezuelans from trekking across remote trails where they are easily extorted by armed groups. But it's unlikely to stem conflict or the flow of contraband in the region. President Nicolas Maduro announced the reopening of bridges linking Venezuela's Tachira state to Colombia's Norte de Santander on June 8. The border had been closed since February 23, after violent clashes broke out as Venezuelan military forces blocked the arrival of humanitarian aid from Colombia. Christian Kruger Sarmiento, director of the Colombia Migration agency, said that 37,000 Venezuelans had made the legal crossing in the first 24 hours and that use of the clandestine trails known as ""trochas"" had been significantly reduced. Sources told InSight Crime that Colombian police had started to destroy these trails with spades and cover them with stones. Amid the closure of the border, the trails became hotspots for conflict as armed groups fought for the profits from illegal migration and contraband movements. Data released by the Venezuelan Observatory of Citizen Security shows that the Venezuelan border city Urena saw its homicide rate more than double during the first half of this year when compared to the same time in 2018. The increase in killings was partly due to gang shoot-outs in the vicinity of the Simon Bolivar and Francisco de Paula Santander international bridges. Such clashes, however, are merely an intensification of the violence that has claimed an estimated 10,000 lives in the region since 2012. The reopening of the international bridge brings relief to many Venezuelans who make regular trips to buy basic necessities in Colombia, as well as thousands more wishing to flee the country. Availability of legal border crossings spares them the perilous journey through the 'trochas' where they are easy prey for criminals. The "" war for the trochas ,"" however, predates the latest border closure, and conflict is likely to continue as long as the contraband flows remain up for grabs. Armed groups vying for control include National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) guerrillas and dissidents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). The ELN and the ex-FARC mafia both have expanded in the region amid the unfolding violent political crisis in Venezuela. Venezuela paramilitaries known as ""colectivos,"" emerging gangs such as ""La Linea,"" and Colombian drug trafficking groups such as the Rastrojos have also moved in to contest smuggling routes and associated extortion rackets. Without effective policing on both sides of the border, conflict over contraband flows may intensify between these armed groups, which can no longer readily extort migrants moving along the pathways. Implementation of such policing is a particular challenge on the Venezuelan side, where border officials have long profited from the movement of contraband and other illicit border economies."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Mega-Gang Turns Venezuelas Largest Landfill into Criminal Fortress. Venezuela's largest garbage dump has become a lawless territory where waste has become the raw material for a lucrative and growing criminal industry. The La Bonanza landfill, near Caracas in the state of Miranda, is now the scene of a range of criminal activities, including extortion, vehicle theft, homicide, drug trafficking and kidnapping. Stretching across 180 hectares, La Bonanza processes around four million kilograms of waste a day and recycles 800,000 kilograms of trash a month. But amid rotten food, cans, bags, aluminum pieces, paper, glass and plastic bottles and other debris, the powerful El Buitre mega-gang has turned the landfill into its operations center. This gang, of around 70 members, thrives on criminal opportunities found at the trash site and has been accumulating wealth, according to police sources who spoke to InSight Crime in Valles de Tuy, in the state of Miranda. Inside La Bonanza, the El Buitre gang has built a bunker with road protection barriers that keeps the police out. The location is also used to hide stolen vehicles and victims of kidnappings , being held for ransom, according to the police. The ""treasures"" in this landfill, such as paper, cardboard, aluminum, copper and plastic are commodities that feed a rising criminal economy in Venezuela. Landfill employees are forced to work for El Buitre, and can be kicked out or even murdered if they refuse. ""We turn in a percentage of what we collect. When we find any objects of value, we must turn them in, because the gang's members are watching closely. One time, I collected a large amount of copper and they wanted to give me 10 percent of its real value. I refused and they answered by shooting me in the leg and taking it away,"" one trash collector told InSight Crime on condition of anonymity. After recovering in bed for two months, the victim had no other means of income and had to beg the ""pran"" (gang leader) for forgiveness in order to return to La Bonanza. ""Next time, you won't live to tell the story,"" he was warned. The Recycling Gang El Buitre's leaders live in popular areas of Valles del Tuy, and in other neighborhoods of Caracas, but use La Bonanza to plan their criminal actions. The gang members are equipped with high-caliber weaponry , such as AK-47s, AR-15 rifles, sub-machine guns, fragmentation grenades and 9 mm caliber pistols. In 2017, authorities launched an operation for the gang's leader, known as ""Buitre,"" and he was finally killed inside the landfill by the Bolivarian National Police (Policia Nacional Bolivariana - PNB). Despite his death, the mega-gang survived under the leadership of alias ""El Goyo,"" who appeared to stay off the authorities' radar. El Goyo led criminal activities at La Bonanza for two years until he was himself killed by other members of the gang in February 2019. The El Buitre now has a new leader, who remains unidentified by the police. Copper is collected for contraband and illegally sold overseas, its price being negotiated in dollars as it has become one of the most profitable economies for the gang. Copper and other types of waste represent such a profitable business that they keep the gang living lives of luxury, with a steady stream of women, alcohol and drugs. While this type of ""recycling"" has long been a low-level criminal economy, the fact that La Bonanza has become such a profitable hub for El Buitre shows how Venezuelan criminal structures have been capable of reinventing themselves in order to survive the harsh crisis lived in the country."	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
"Paraguay Seizes 25 Tons of Venezuela Currency. Paraguay has seized 25 metric tons of Venezuelan currency, an illustration of how this soon to be worthless cash is highly valuable to counterfeiters looking to convert it into US dollars. The stash of 50 and 100 bolivar notes was found hidden in bags at properties belonging to an arms dealer in the Paraguayan city of Salto del Guaira, on the Brazilian border, Reuters reported. Authorities are still evaluating the value of the seizure, as well as the motive behind the theft of such a huge quantity of currency. ""One possibility is that [the money] was used to acquire dollars in the Venezuelan black market, or that it would have been used to counterfeit dollars given the high quality of the paper used for Venezuelan bills,"" a police report states. Prosecutor Julio Cesar Yegros told Monumental AM that the cash apparently entered the country from Brazil. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced in mid-December 2016 that the 100 bolivar bill -- which until recently was the highest value banknote -- would be pulled from circulation. After numerous postponements, its withdrawal has been scheduled for February 20. Maduro said the removal of the 100 bolivar bill was meant to attack ""mafias"" in Colombia who were stashing cash in order to ""destabilize the Venezuelan economy."" On the surface, this seizure in Paraguay appears to give weight to President Maduro's cash hoarding theory. But the fact that the stash was found far from Venezuela only days before the 100 bolivar note will become worthless means it's more likely that the money was intended for counterfeiting purposes. With 100 bolivars worth a mere 3 US cents on the black market, the paper the money is printed on is of higher value to counterfeiters, who use it as raw material to print dollars. Given that a single US bill weighs approximately 1 gram , the potential value of the seized currency would be over $2 billion dollars, if all the bill were made into $100 bills. Although Paraguay may not stand out as a counterfeit currency hub -- like, for example, Peru -- there is evidence that such activities have been taking place for a number of years , especially in cities along the Brazilian border. It is also possible that the cash load was merely passing through this key transit country, facilitated by lax border enforcement."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Contraband Cost Brazil a Staggering $41 Billion in 2016: Watchdog. Contraband cost Brazil tens of billions of dollars in 2016, according to two watchdog groups, an astonishing amount of money that illustrates the depth of the problem. Brazil's Parliamentary Front for the Fight on Contraband and Counterfeit (Frente Parlamentar Mista de Combate ao Contrabando e a Falsificacao) and the National Movement for the Defense of Brazil's Legal Market (Movimento Nacional em Defesa do Mercado Legal Brasileiro) said the country lost an estimated $41.5 billion (130 billion reais) in 2016 due to contraband, reported the Jornal do Brasil. The two organizations shared the figure during the launch of a campaign to fight contraband -- ""The Brazil we Want"" ("" O Brasil que nos queremos "") -- which is backed by the Ministry of Justice. The figure is the sum of the monetary losses suffered by some sectors of the economy due to the flow of contraband into the country -- chiefly the textile, tobacco and car industries -- and the money lost through tax evasion on contraband products. The practice has reportedly increased by 13 percent compared to 2015, when the losses suffered by contraband were valued at an estimated $36.7 billion. Authorities believe this is due to a combination of different factors, namely the increase in taxes, the country's economic crisis, and the fragility of its borders. Efraim Filho, President of the Parliamentary Front for the Fight on Contraband and Counterfeit, said the fight against contraband entails tougher border controls, but it also requires eradicating people's acquiescence towards the crime. ""People often consider [contraband] to be a rather mild criminal offense, because the image they have is that of a man who sells CDs and DVDs, or counterfeit clothes and bags. But when you dig deeper, contraband is actually something extremely violent and dangerous for society, a practice that jeopardizes formal jobs, finances drug trafficking and puts people's health at risk,"" Filho was quoted in Agencia Brasil as saying. The estimates for the amount of money lost on contraband in Brazil are staggering, to say the least. To put the figure into perspective, the World Bank valued Brazil's 2015 GDP at $1,775 trillion. If the estimates are correct, the money lost in contraband that year amounted to over 2 percent of the country's GDP. And as the contraband estimates reportedly increased in 2016, this figure is likely to have grown bigger through time. One of the goals of ""The Brazil We Want"" campaign is to highlight the positive effects that would result from the eradication of contraband. With $41.5 billion, the campaign says the government could build 1,000 more hospitals, 65,000 kindergartens, 1.3 millions public housing units, or over 25,000 public schools."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Venezuelas Withdrawal of Bolivar Bill Promises to Benefit Organized Crime. President Nicolas Maduro has justified the withdrawal of Venezuela's 100 bolivar note as a means of undercutting criminal earnings, but past examples suggest that criminal groups will actually profit from the move and the related border closure with Colombia. The announcement of the currency withdrawal within three days coupled with the border closure was made by the president on December 11, in what he described as a way of stopping criminal groups allegedly hoarding wealth in 100 bolivar bills in foreign countries from bringing their illegally-obtained earnings back to Venezuela, reported the BBC. Maduro argued that the move to pull the 100 bolivar bill from circulation would undermine the criminal groups that profit from the smuggling dynamics between Colombia and food-starved Venezuela, claiming that large quantities of the bills were stocked in Colombian cities such as Cucuta, Cartagena, Maicao and Bucaramanga. Venezuelan authorities also announced the seizure of millions of 100 bolivar notes being smuggled back from Colombia to be exchanged before the withdrawal ultimatum, according to the multi-state funded media TeleSUR. But the new 500 bolivars notes -- the lowest value of the six new replacement bills -- only arrived on December 18, according to Le Monde , and on December 17 Venezuelan authorities eventually postponed the withdrawal ultimatum to January 2 after violent riots broke out, reported the Guardian. While the decision to rapidly withdraw the 100 bolivar note from circulation will have at best a mild effect on criminal organizations' capital, the border closure and the ensuing social unrest promise to benefit criminal groups on both sides of the frontier. Subsidized Venezuelan petrol has long gushed across the border for sale at higher prices in Colombia. More recently and within the context of Venezuela's flailing economy, a reversed dynamic of basic goods bought in Colombia and brought back to food-starved Venezuela has been created both by criminal structures as well as waves of Venezuelans shopping for basic goods across the border. To believe as President Maduro claims that 300 billion's worth of a highly volatile currency is being hoarded by criminal structures outside the country, largely in the form of the 100 bolivar bill worth roughly $4 cents on the Venezuelan black market, is a stretch. Moreover, while there probably is a significant quantity of Venezuelan currency circulating in Colombia's border regions, it is hard to speculate on what proportion of those bills are linked to organized crime instead of individual Venezuelans coming in by the tens of thousands to seek basic goods across the border. SEE ALSO : Venezuela News and Profile What is likely is that the closure of the international frontier will strengthen criminal operations on both sides of the border, something that was observed during the last closure, which started in August 2015 and lasted until August this year. As InSight Crimepreviously explained, smugglers were pushed more into unofficial routes controlled by Colombian criminal groups (""bandas criminales"" - BACRIM) and rebel armies (the National Liberation Army --ELN, for example, and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia --FARC), who all tax contraband smugglers moving across the border. In Venezuela, the border closure will hand corrupt members of the armed forces, such as the National Guard, more power to charge smugglers who wish to cross, as happened during the last closure. The latest decision also promises to inflate the price of goods on the black market in Venezuela, increasing criminal profits. And the longer the closure lasts, the more demand will grow within the illegal economy, with individual Venezuelans now unable to access vital basic goods directly in Colombia. Beyond the smuggling dynamics, the social tensions and subsequent violence fueled by the currency withdrawal announcement may further the already fertile ground for criminal groups in Venezuela. According to RunRun, at least twelve Venezuelan states suffered from violent outbreaks as a result of the announcement by President Maduro. Political and social opposition against Maduro has led the government to increasingly rely on the military (widely seen as heavily corrupt and a key actor in the country's drug trade ) and armed, pro-government groups referred to as ""colectivos"" (which are becoming more criminal) to contain them. That strategy is likely to continue if current protests persist."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Contraband Costing Guatemala 22% of Annual Budget. Representatives from Guatemala's agricultural industry have claimed food contraband has increased by almost one-third this year and cost the government over $2 billion in 2015, an accusation that does not bode well for the country's attempt to crack down on its corrupt customs agency. Guatemala's trade union of food producers (La Gremial de Fabricantes de Alimentos - GREFAL) estimated that food contraband increased by 30 percent this year, reported La Hora. According to Luis Mazariegos, a union representative, contraband cooking oil from Mexico was particularly prominent, representing an estimated 30 percent of all total food contraband. Other products where GREFAL noted an increase in contraband items included: rice, eggs, pasta products, liquor, tobacco, snacks and sweets. On top of negatively impacting Guatemalan companies, Mazariegos said the total opportunity cost of these illicit products in 2015 amounted to 16 billion Guatemalan quetzales -- over $2.1 billion -- due to taxes and revenues not collected by the state. As pointed out by elPeriodico , this lost sum would cover more than 20 percent of the Guatemalan government's 2016 budget of roughly $9.4 billion, underlining the magnitude of the problem. Indeed, the value of contraband passing through 113 border crossings with Mexico, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras is sufficient to cover the entire budget of Guatemala's Education Ministry ($1.8 billion), and is around three times that of the Health Ministry ($728 million). GREFAL has called for the more enforcement and legal measures to address the problem, arguing that only 13 food contraband investigations were opened in 2015, and only three of those were adequately pursued. The figures presented by GREFAL are significant. Despite suspicion about their accuracy or exaggeration aroused by union's financial interest in the issue, Guatemala's failure to rein in contraband is beyond dispute. Corruption within Guatemala's tax and customs authority (Superintendencia de Administracion Tributaria - SAT) has gotten a lot of attention recently. Last year, President Otto Perez Molina and his vice president, Roxana Baldetti, resigned from office and were subsequently arrested in connection with a customs fraud scheme , known as ""La Linea."" Prosecutors allege the scheme involved officials lowering import taxes on goods in exchange for kickbacks. Perez Molina and Baldetti are currently in jail awaiting trial. The United Nations-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG) has been supporting the country's efforts to fight high-level corruption to good effect, as La Linea and several other emblematic cases demonstrate. Despite this progress, the alarm sounded by agrobusiness over the scale of food contraband is a stark reminder that Guatemala still faces deep structural challenges and the fight against corruption must be waged at all levels of governance."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Costa Rica Proposes Harsh Punishments for Contraband. Costa Rica is considering imposing prison sentences for small-scale contraband smugglers, a hardline response to an illicit activity that governments across the region are struggling to reign in. Costa Rica's Congress is discussing a proposal that would set a minimum sentence of three years for smuggling small amounts of contraband products, reported La Nacion. Under the current law, only those found smuggling over $50,000 of goods face time in prison. The proposal, still in its infancy, has already generated plenty of controversy, with the Attorney General asserting that the law would create a backlog of cases in southern Costa Rica. He called for a lower minimum sentence of six months. The proposal has also become a cause of concern for locals near Costa Rica's southern border with Panama, where there is a high rate of small-scale smuggling. ""What they are proposing is a law that would kill, that would destroy the residents in the frontier region,"" a local councilman in the southern municipality of Corredores told La Nacion. He added that he believes 80 percent of people in the area make a living off of contraband. Costan Rican business assocation the UCCAEP has publicly supported the proposal, saying it will cut down on smuggling, reported EFE. The new proposal is an attempt to stem the heavy flow of contraband goods into Costa Rica: in August 2014, authorities said that smuggling costs the country up to $100 million annually from lost tax revenue. There was also a reported spike in the smuggling of contraband cigarettes, following a a 2012 tax law that significantly increased the price of tobacco products in Costa Rica. This reported expansion in contraband smuggling recently prompted Costa Rica's Vice Minister of Finance to claim that contraband was a bigger problem than drug trafficking. However, it is doubtful that threatening small-time smugglers with up to three years in prison would prove to be a successful policy. Last year, Costa Rican authorities noted that organized criminal groups are taking on a bigger role in the country's contraband industry. Targeting the ""micro"" smugglers who rely on contraband because they have no other job opportunities would only fill up the country's prisons and create much bad feeling, as the Attorney General warned. Contraband is a huge drain on economies across Latin America, and there is a wide range in how different governments have responded to the problem. Last year, Venezuela and Colombia agreed to send more security forces to their shared border , where high price discrepancies have fueled the smuggling of all kinds of products, from gasoline to meat to prescription medicine. In another attempt to cut down on contraband, last year Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ordered the closing of Colombian border crossings at night. Meanwhile, in Brazil, where the contraband business reportedly cost the formal economy over $ 20 billion last year , authorities have installed 1,600 cameras inside its biggest sea port."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
"Colombia Fights Fuel Smuggling with Armed Helicopters. Authorities in Colombia have reportedly started using armed helicopters to stop gasoline smugglers crossing the border from Venezuela, an aggressive measure that underscores both the seriousness of the problem and the difficulties that security forces face in combatting it. In a May 28 operation in Colombia's northeastern Cesar province, police, military, and customs officials employed two helicopters armed with machine guns to stop a convoy of 18 gasoline trucks, reported El Tiempo. Security forces placed barricades on a road near the Colombia-Venezuela border so that police could detain the smugglers with support from the air. Security forces captured 19 individuals and seized over 33,000 gallons of fuel. However, as police transported the detainees to a nearby city, they were attacked by locals wielding rocks and sticks and had to call in the riot police. The operation was the third this week targeting Colombia's lucrative contraband gasoline trade. In the first two operations, authorities arrested 15 smugglers and seized 13 vehicles and over 36,000 gallons of fuel. On the other side of the border, in Venezuela, security forces have seized more than 317,000 gallons of gasoline in Zulia state so far this year, reported El Siglo. Venezuelan authorities are also attempting to control gasoline sales through the installation of electronic chips on vehicles. The use of helicopters armed with machine guns to combat the contraband gasoline trade is an example of the extreme measures security forces have had to employ in order to stop smugglers. In the Colombia-Venezuela border region, gasoline smugglers typically travel in convoys known as ""caravans of death"" because of the speed and recklessness with which they drive (see video below). Armed escorts often accompany the convoys to protect them from security forces, and the drivers usually only stop if they crash. In addition, locals who are financially dependent on the contraband trade also protect the ""caravans of death,"" fighting with police when they detain smugglers, as illustrated by the recent operation. The profits on offer in the illegal fuel trade -- due to the discrepancy in gasoline prices between Venezuela and Colombia -- have attracted narco-paramilitary groups known as BACRIM, in addition to the contraband families who have traditionally run the trade, and corrupted local politicians. Indeed, one of the major gasoline smuggling operations in the border region was allegedly run by the former governor of Colombia's northeastern La Guajira province , Francisco ""Kiko"" Gomez, who was arrested in October 2013 ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Peru Ups Contraband Seizures. Peru reported seizing $379 million in pirated and contraband material in 2014, highlighting the extent of this illicit trade in the Andean country. The reported value of the seized material was released by the vice minister of the agency which oversees small businesses in Peru. The figure represents a $40 million increase over what authorities confiscated in 2013 and a $200 million increase of what was confiscated in 2012. ""Roughly 70 percent of what's being seized is contraband and the remaining 30 percent is pirated material,"" Adolfo Bernui, the technical secretary of Peru's anti-piracy and contraband commission, told InSight Crime. Pirated materials largely consist of software and entertainment goods such as DVDs and music. Contraband materials are usually goods like clothing, liquor and cigarettes that have not been taxed or cleared through Peruvian customs, the official said. Smuggled fuel also makes up a large part of seized contraband. Smugglers purchase government-subsidized fuel in neighboring Bolivia and Ecuador, smuggle it into Peru and sell it at profit, Bernui explained. A mix of individuals and small groups, as well as organized crime networks, are responsible for Peru's piracy and smuggling industry, the official said. Organized criminal groups run caravans of vehicles carrying contraband, known as ""snakes,"" from Bolivia into southern Peruvian states like Puno, Bernui added. The nearly $400 million worth of contraband and pirated goods seized in Peru is another example of the scale of this trade across Central and South America. In Costa Rica, for example, government officials recently said they consider contraband a bigger problem than drug trafficking. And as appears to be the case in Peru, it is not only large-scale criminal groups making a profit off of contraband, but individual operators who have few other economic options. There have been huge seizures of contraband reported in Peru, indication that larger, organized criminal groups are involved in the trade, including a raid last July in which Peruvian police confiscated about 220 tons of contraband goods with estimated value of $2 million. Those goods were moved in one of the ""snake"" caravans that transfer goods between Bolivia and Peru, where the southeastern city of Juliaca serves as a major hub for shipping the products elsewhere in the country."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Colombia Seizing Over $300,000 of Contraband a Day. In just the first 20 days of January 2014, Colombia's tax and customs police (Polfa) seized nearly $6.5 million in contraband products. The most commonly smuggled items were clothes, shoes and food, raising questions about who is behind the bulk of this trade. Textiles make up the bulk of seizures made in Colombia -- over $30 million in textiles were seized in 2013, representing 46 percent of all goods. These are followed by food, shoes, perfume and motor vehicles, reported Portafolio. The trade poses a major financial problem for domestic businesses, which are unable to compete with the extremely low prices of contraband goods. General Jorge Hernando Nieto, director of citizen security for the national police, said his unit will be prioritizing the issue of contraband in the coming year. This, he said, will allow them to ""simultaneously combat connected crimes, such as money laundering, drug trafficking, extortion, and the wealth of illegal groups."" The daily seizure average, if maintained throughout the year, would equal approximately $118 million in goods by the end of 2014. This is just a fraction of the annual market worth of the trade, estimated at around $6 billion. According to the Financial Analysis and Information Unit (UIAF), this represents 1.7 percent of Colombia's annual gross domestic product (GDP). Venezuela is a major source of this trade, with up to 40 percent of items imported into the country later smuggled into Colombia, according to the Venezuelan government. Venezuelan gasoline, and liquor and cigarettes from duty free zones in places like Colon, Panama are some of the most often cited products in Colombia's contraband market. These are thought to be largely controlled by criminal groups like the Urabenos and the Rastrojos, who use the trade to launder drug money. Given this, it is interesting such a high percentage of contraband seizures are attributed to clothing and shoes -- not products usually associated with Colombia's criminal groups. One Polfa official said the majority of these contraband products come from China, meaning the smuggling method would also be different. If the seizures are representative of the overall market, it raises the question of who is controlling this lucrative clothing trade. It is also plausible, however, that these items are more commonly seized because the larger criminal groups controlling gasoline and alcohol have more sophisticated smuggling structures and networks of corruption facilitating their passage."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
"Ecuador-Peru Contraband Gasoline Trade Worth More Than $40M Per Year. At least $50,000 worth of contraband gasoline is crossing from Ecuador into Peru each day, according to police, as subsidized fuel makes smuggling big business in different parts of the region. Around 15 criminal groups use seven different routes to transport gasoline from Machala, an Ecuadorean town five hours from the border, to the Peruvian cities of Tumbes, Piura and Chiclayo, reported newspaper El Comercio. The regional police estimate around 50,000 gallons of gasoline is crossing the border each day -- worth around $55,000 in Ecuador, but around $225,000 in Peru. Gasoline is subsidized in Ecuador and is sold for around $1.10 a gallon. In Peru it costs around $4.50, said a Peruvian prosecutor who specializes in customs violations and contraband. The smugglers receive around $180 dollars for a 55 gallon barrel of fuel, one told El Comercio, meaning they are making a profit of around $2.20 a gallon. If police estimates about the amount of fuel being smuggled daily are correct, profits of more than $40 million are being made each year. Jorge Juarez, head of tax and customs police in Tumbes, told El Comercio that corrupt police were part of the contraband chain. ""We know that we need to get rid of at least 100 agents in Tumbes,"" he said. Subsidized gasoline mean huge price differentials across various Latin American borders, making the contraband a highly profitable business -- most notably for those bringing it into Colombia from Venezuela, where the price of fuel is less than six cents a gallons, cheaper than water. The Venezuelan government said earlier this year around 120,000 gallons of illegal gasoline a day (around 35 million a month) was crossing into Colombia, where it can be sold from anything $1.50 to $6 a gallon. The same phenomenon occurs in Bolivia , where subsidized fuel is smuggled to Argentina and Paraguay. With such huge profits available the trade has inevitably seen the involvement of criminal groups. While much smuggling is carried out by small groups, those individuals must pay bribes to major criminal gangs in order to make their journeys. The Colombian organization Los Rastrojos is believed to control part of the Colombia-Venezuela border region. Map showing gasoline routes from Ecuador to Peru"	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Colombia to Create Anti-Smuggling Task Force. Colombia's government announced plans for a new anti-smuggling task force to counter the contraband trade, which is estimated to cost the country up to $5 billion per year. The Anti-Smuggling Task Force (FEA) will monitor imported goods using new scanning systems, and satellite tracking, to be implemented at Colombia's points of entry. The aim is to ensure that all goods coming into the country are tracked, with any anomalies, such as route deviations, instantly detected, reports Portafolio. DIAN, Colombia's tax and customs agency, seized $27 million in smuggled goods last year, up from the previous year's $16 million. The goods most often seized include alcohol, gasoline from Venezuela, footwear, televisions, and mobile phones. The contraband industry is thought to cost the Colombian government between $1.5 billion and $5 billion annually in lost taxes. Many of these operations are run by small organizations with few or no ties to other types of organized crime. However, the government has expressed concern that some types of contraband, particularly liquor , are increasingly controlled by neo-paramilitary groups, labelled by the government as ""criminal bands"" (BACRIMs). Historically, transnational criminal organizations in Colombia used the contraband trade to launder drug money, turning US dollars from their cocaine sales back into Colombian pesos. This was achieved mainly through "" San Andresitos ,"" shopping areas offering smuggled goods at heavily discounted prices. The goods would be bought abroad in duty-free zones such as Panama, then smuggled to Colombian and sold in pesos. The government has cracked down on these areas since the late 1990s, making it harder to launder drug profits in this way. However, in light of the continuing importance of the contraband trade, it is likely that transnational criminal groups maintain a significant hand in contraband operations. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombias Illegal Booze Trade Causing Headaches. Contraband liquor is an increasingly serious business in Colombia, not just for those made sick by tainted alcohol, but for law enforcement concerned that the trade is increasingly controlled by organized crime. A study carried out by the University of Antioquia reportedly found that the department's contraband liquor trade is increasingly controlled by the paramilitary successor groups the government calls BACRIMs (criminal bands). According to El Tiempo , liquor sellers in upper-class neighborhoods in Medellin are forced to buy their product from a faction of the Rastrojos , who peddle diluted alcohol. ""They come by Wednesday, Thursday and Friday distributing the false alcohol,"" the article quotes one unnamed ""high-level"" government source as saying. ""Monday and Tuesday they come back and pick up the money."" A 750ml bottle of the popular anise-flavored alcoholic drink known as aguardiente should legally sell for 22,000 pesos (about $11). Bootleg versions sell on the street, reportedly distributed by criminal gangs, can sell for as little as 4,000 pesos (about $2). Authorities have previously expressed fears that such contraband activity -- traditionally managed by extended families based along the coast or the frontier, who have been involved in smuggling for decades -- is increasingly controlled by the BACRIMs. The profits are significant: according to customs and tax agency DIAN, Colombia loses $1.5 billion a year to untaxed, smuggled goods. This includes a loss of $300 million for bootleg alcohol and another $300 million for the contraband sale of cigarettes, the DIAN says. El Tiempo reports that the bootleg alcohol business in Colombia follows three business models: the first is the sale of alcohol smuggled from Venezuela, either through the departments of La Guajira or Norte de Santander. The second is the fabrication of adulterated liquor, like the poisonous brew which killed at least 51 people in Ecuador over the course of several weeks this year. In Colombia, police have found primitive distilleries where bootleggers use rusty nails to give the Antioquia rum its characteristic ""reddish"" color, as well as generous use of methanol. The third business model reportedly pursued by criminal gangs is the recycling of alcohol containers to rebottle adulterated booze. ""There's basically something like a mafia around the recycling of these containers,"" one unnamed ex-congressman told El Tiempo. A recycled bottle of whiskey or rum can go for 6,000 pesos ($3), more if the official label is still intact and in good condition. Urban centers like Medellin are filled with families who make their living perusing through trash looking for glass recyclables. A typical daily income for such families can be as little as 12,000 pesos ($6) a day, and that's without considering the daily cost of renting the cart used to haul the collected trash: 5,000 pesos ($2.50) a day. Considering the number of families that criminal enterprises could tax to use trash-collecting carts -- in return for doing the dirty work of collecting the city's abandoned alcohol bottles -- this could in fact present an attractive source of income for the Medellin gangs who make up the Oficina de Envigado. Contraband liquor running has been present in Colombia since before the 19th century. Sailors, merchants and immigrant families along the coast made use of smuggling routes along Colombia's thousands of natural sea ports. Many one the most-traveled contraband routes - the desert town Maicao, which borders Venezuela; and the Atrato river, which flows into the Darien Gulf by Panama - are the same ones adopted by drug traffickers today. Liquor, cigarettes, salt and textiles were once the primary goods smuggled between Panama, Venezuela and Ecuador. Nowadays, Chinese knock-offs of toys, medicines and brand name fashion enter through Colombia's Pacific ports, while subsidized gasoline from Venezuela enters from the eastern border towns. Ecuador sees a significant contraband trade of fertilizer and contraband oil -- materials used in drug processing and for making explosives. Far more than alcohol, the contraband gas trade has proved by far Colombia's most widespread activity. Historically, it is also the trade that has most attracted the attention of illegal armed groups, beginning with the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia ( AUC ). Rodrigo Tovar, alias ""Jorge 40,"" commander of the AUC's northern bloc, killed a notorious contraband runner, Mario Cotes, in 2002, in order to gain control of smuggling hotspot La Guajira. As Colombia's northernmost peninsula which boasts hundreds of miles of coastline and easy access to Venezuela, La Guajira, along with its landlocked neighbor Cesar, is the capital of Colombia's contraband gas trade. Controlling territory in La Guajira was so important that soon other paramilitary warlords followed Tovar's example. Another AUC commander, alias ""Pablo,"" befriended an indigenous contraband runner in this department, alias ""Chema Bala,"" who enabled the entry of Pablo's army into this department -- all for the sake of gaining access to drug-running (and contraband routes). Given the history of the AUC's involvement in the gas trade, it is no wonder that in Colombia's official political discourse, contraband is often mentioned in the same breath as ""drug trafficking"" and ""terrorism."" In one recent speech about proposed reforms to Colombia's customs agency, President Juan Manuel Santos stated that contraband is ""linked to other crimes like money laundering and narcotrafficking, which finance terrorism and criminal networks."" This could explain why the government has recently made moves to crack down on contraband. A new customs agency, set to become active November 1, reportedly has the mandate of slashing smuggling rates from 14 percent of all imports down to six. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"La Guajira: Up for Grabs for Colombias Drug Gangs?The strategic Colombian peninsula of La Guajira, a sought after departure point for drugs heading across the Caribbean, may be up for grabs once more with the arrest of the gang leader who controlled this arid and remote corner of the country. According to El Colombiano , on Saturday police arrested alias ""Cobra,"" allegedly responsible for the storage and transport of drugs smuggled from La Guajira to the U.S. via Caribbean islands, especially the Dominican Republic. His partner, alias ""Pantera,"" was also detained. These arrests leave a power void once again in La Guajira, Colombia's northernmost point, about 21,000 square kilometers of barren desert and plains. According to one estimate , about 30 percent of Colombia's total cocaine and heroin exports depart from northern Guajira alone. The province's long coastline and countless number of natural ports allows drug traffickers in go-fast boats to quickly move drug shipments to either Venezuela or Caribbean islands like Aruba or Curacao. The maritime routes are cheaper and easier than land routes. The desert terrain attracts tourists and supports industries like coal mining, but the lack of agriculture and job opportunities has long nourished a thriving contraband industry. Gas, food, weapons and drugs are all smuggled from La Guajira's sea ports to other contraband hubs like the neighboring Venezuelan state Zulia. In contrast to the other major coastal export points for drugs in Colombia - the Pacific coast, the Gulf of Uraba - in La Guajira, leftist guerrilla groups have little presence. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) have three Fronts present on the Venezuelan border, numbering around 250 fighters, including the 59th Front which is still capable of carrying out some attacks against infrastructure. As a result, the most lucrative criminal activities like drug trafficking, the contraband gasoline trade and extortion are controlled by the successors of the right-wing paramilitaries, groups which the government calls ""criminal bands"" (bandas criminales - BACRIMS). ""Cobra"" led one such group known as the BACRIM of Upper Guajira, made up of former paramilitaries who once fought for the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC). The estimated 100 combatants who form part of the Upper Guajira BACRIM will now have to defend their highly valuable territory -- the northernmost municipalities, which offer the most direct route to Venezuela and the Caribbean islands -- from incoming rivals like the Urabenos or the Paisas. The Urabenos, whose stronghold is along the Caribbean coast, already have a foot in southern Guajira. When InSight Crime visited the area last year , sources said there were about 120 members of the Urabenos deployed in urban areas, and about another 90 in the countryside, operating in cells of five or six men. They are highly organized and pay their recruits well; sources told InSight Crime a typical salary is about $670 a month. As a result rival gang, the Paisas, have been forced into a truce with the Urabenos in La Guajira. But even though the Urabenos are well disciplined and flush with cash, the Upper Guajira BACRIM have one key advantage: a tolerant relationship with the indigenous tribe, the Wayuu, who live in the region and for whom much of the Guajira peninsula is an indigenous reservation. The relationship dates back to the days of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC) who first entered La Guajira in 1998, carrying out a series of brutal masscares against the indigenous people. One Wayuu man, Jose Maria Barros Ipuano, alias ""Chema Bala,"" forged a close relationship with another paramilitary leader, Arnulfo Sanchez Gonzalez, alias ""Pablo,"" hoping to use the AUC to protect his contraband business. Through Ipuano, Gonzalez was able to establish connections with Wayuu people, and set up his drug trafficking operations in Upper Guajira where there is scarce military or police presence. He began taxing other drug traffickers for using La Guajira smuggling routes, as much as 500,000 pesos (about US$275) per kilo, and soon earned himself the nickname ""Lord of the Desert."" After Ipuano's arrest in 2004, Gonzalez remained in the department, having won the trust of some factions of the Wayuu. This grassroots support proved key to the survival of Gonzalez's business: he found refuge from the authorities when needed, gained access to key supplies, and used local guides to find natural habours for his drug exports and eliminate his indigenous rivals. After Gonzalez was arrested in November 2011, ""Cobra"" assumed command of the group. His arrest, just nine months later, may be one indication that he was not capable of sustaining the same close relationship with the Wayuu allies who protected Gonzalez. With both ""Pablo"" and ""Cobra"" gone, the Upper Guajira BACRIM will have a hard time fending off the advance of the Urabenos or the Paisas, should they choose to enter more deeply into Guajira's northern deserts. The Urabenos once were able to rely on the support on a Wayuu intermediary, Norberto Javier Henriquez Iguaran, alias ""Chueco,"" who was able to offer the group sanctuary in areas where he had influence, but he was arrested in June. Without finding some factions of the Wayuu who are willing to tolerate the presence of drug gangs in indigenous territory, the Urabenos may not prove so capable of finally seizing La Guajira for themselves.

"New PCC Crime Boss Consolidates Power on Brazil-Paraguay Border. The presence of a new Brazilian crime boss operating on the border with Paraguay illustrates the sophisticated expansion strategy of Brazil's most powerful gang and the important role the border region plays in transnational organized crime. Sources in Paraguay's security forces told news outlet ABC Color that Sergio de Arruda Quintiliano Neto, alias ""Minotauro,"" an alleged member of the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC), is the new crime boss in the Paraguayan border town of Pedro Juan Caballero, where the criminal group maintains a well-established presence. Locally, Minotauro also goes by his last name, Neto, and he uses Paraguayan identification documents under the name Celso Matos Espindola. He may have begun operating in the region to fill the vacuum left when PCC leader Elton Leonel Rumich da Silva, alias ""Gala,"" was arrested in Rio de Janeiro earlier this year. Gala had allegedly led the organization in the same border region since mid-2016. Minotauro rose to power in Rio de Janeiro's Rocinha favela, and reports leaked to security forces show that the Brazilian police had already suspected him as the new PCC leader in Paraguay. The crime boss made headlines in March after he allegedly ordered the murder of a police officer in Ponta Pora, the Brazilian town lying directly across the border from Pedro Juan Caballero. The police countered with an operation in which they found Paraguayan identification documents but failed to arrest Minotauro. Brazilian authorities have also levied charges against the gang leader, including money laundering, falsifying public documents and identity theft. Brazilian gang presence along the border with Paraguay is not new. But the PCC's interest in consolidating power in Pedro Juan Caballero shows growing sophistication in its transnational organized crime activities, a necessary strategy as it contends with other gangs moving into the region from Brazil, among them Red Command (Comando Vermelho). Criminals from Brazil and other countries take refuge in Pedro Juan Caballero and its surrounding border region because it serves as a strategic location for continuing criminal activities while evading justice in their home countries. Minotauro's alleged rise in the Paraguayan city's underworld also shows that a new generation of Brazilian criminals is cropping up in Paraguay. And they are willing and able to aggressively challenge institutions and commit violent acts against not only other criminals, but also local businesses and authorities. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Weekly InSight: Behind the Scenes of Our Investigation of MS13 in the Americas. In our February 15 Facebook Live session, Co-Director Steven Dudley, Senior Investigator Hector Silva Avalos and Senior Editor Mike LaSusa took a behind-the-scenes look at a groundbreaking new investigation of the MS13 by InSight Crime and American University's Center for Latin American & Latino Studies. Dudley and Silva, the report's primary authors, explained how some of the main findings of their investigation challenge existing misperceptions about the gang, including those surrounding the structure of its hierarchy as well as its relationship to immigration flows and the international drug trade. This article is the result of field work done for a multi-year research initiative evaluating the transnational criminal capacity of MS13 in the US and El Salvador by InSight Crime and American University's Center for Latin American & Latino Studies , with funding from the National Institute of Justice. See the full report here. The authors also discussed challenges they faced in undertaking the investigation, as well as how their research shed light on divergent views of the gang held by law enforcement officials and individuals living in communities with a heavy gang presence.

"Too Little Too Late? Bolivia, Brazil to Boost Efforts Against Criminal Migration. Authorities in Bolivia and Brazil will enter into a bilateral agreement later this month aimed at combating the expansion of Brazilian criminal groups into Bolivia, but the move might prove to be a tardy and ultimately insufficient response to this phenomenon. Starting July 26, four high-ranking Brazilian police officers will be stationed in the Bolivian cities of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Puerto Suarez, Guayaramerin and Cobija to coordinate everyday security operations with Bolivian police forces, El Deber reported. Bolivia has been pushing for this bilateral exchange for three years, according to El Deber, while Brazil has wanted to confirm the presence of Brazilian crime groups in Bolivia first. But after an attack on a jewelry store in eastern Bolivia July 13 that left five dead, three of whom were allegedly linked to Brazil's First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC), officials said the move was immediately initiated. However, there is some disagreement about whether this attack actually involved the PCC. Marcio Christiano, a prosecutor in the PCC's home city of Sao Paulo, told El Deber that the crime group did not participate in the jewelry store heist, and that their presence in Bolivia is primarily linked to drug trafficking, explaining that Bolivia is one of Brazil's ""natural partners"" for cocaine production in South America. Bolivia Deputy Minister for Social Defense Felipe Caceres seemed to echo these statements, and told El Deber that the PCC is primarily involved in drug trafficking activities and decided to migrate into Bolivia to expand their power and control over that industry. In addition to the PCC, which is thought to have the strongest foreign criminal presence in Bolivia with an estimated 1,500 members , Bolivian authorities have identified two other Brazilian criminal groups operating in Bolivia: the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) and Family of the North (Familia do Norte - FDN). The Red Command and FDN have since allied against the PCC to dispute the latter's control, according to El Deber. However, Bolivian Interior Minister Carlos Romero recently said that Brazilian crime groups are "" sharing territorial control "" in Bolivia, pointing to conflicting assessments of the relationships among these groups. The FDN and the Red Command have been aligned in a broader war with the PCC that rocked Brazil's prison system earlier this year with a wave of extreme violence. While increased bilateral cooperation is a step in the right direction, it is unlikely to be a gamechanger in the short term as the dynamics of Brazilian crime groups in Bolivia are not fully understood. Kathryn Ledebur, the executive director of the Andean Information Network (AIN), told InSight Crime that there is not enough information available about the PCC in Bolivia to draw any firm conclusions about its operations there, adding that the ""drug trade in and through Bolivia tends to be quite decentralized"" and that it has not generally led to ""violent competition to control routes or territory."" On the other hand, there is a long history of collaboration between Brazilian and Bolivian crime groups on contraband smuggling, and some experts believe this dynamic has intensified recently. Eduardo Gamarra, a political science professor at Florida International University, told InSight Crime he feels that the planned boost in bilateral efforts will not be enough to deter the PCC from expanding their operations in Bolivia, estimating the gang's presence to be much larger than the 1,500 estimated by Bolivian officals. ""The number [of PCC members in Bolivia] is probably much higher than Bolivian authorities are willing to recognize, [and] involves more than simple foot soldiers, maybe even mid- and top-level decision makers,"" Gamarra told InSight Crime."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Are Central American Gangs Growing in Southern Mexico?Authorities in Mexico's southern border region have detained a growing number of gang members in 2017. Their affiliation, however, is reportedly with two Central American gangs, the MS13 and Barrio 18, raising questions about whether or not these crime groups are having a resurgence in Mexico. So far in 2017, authorities in Mexico's southeastern state of Chiapas, which shares a border with Guatemala, have detained 148 gang members believed to be affiliated with Central American ""maras,"" as the MS13 and Barrio 18 are known locally. This figure is more than ten times the total number of mara-affiliated gang members (13) the state detained in 2016, according to statistics from the Chiapas Security and Citizen Protection Secretariat (Secretaria de Seguridad y Proteccion Ciudadana del estado de Chiapas), El Sol de Mexico reported. However, the detained gang members are not solely Central American. Forty-four percent of those detained were Salvadoran, 36 percent were Mexican and 20 percent were Honduran, though all of them identified with either the Barrio 18 (55 percent) or the MS13 (45 percent). Violence in Chiapas has also reportedly increased with the return of Central American maras, according to El Sol de Mexico. Twenty-eight homicides have been committed so far this year by members of the gangs, double the 14 homicides committed in 2016 and triple the seven homicides committed in 2015. If these numbers are to be believed, the presence of Central American maras in Mexico is not new. While the maras are a Central American brand, they are multinational organizations whose ranks are filled with members from around the region. Both the MS13 and Barrio 18 have expanded to Europe and established a presence in Spain and Italy in the past, and they maintain a strong foothold in many areas of the United States. One theory behind why the gangs are trying to expand into Mexico is that they are seeking the help of locals to ""open a drug corridor"" in order to capitalize on the weakening of the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels. But the maras have tried this before , and both the MS13 and Barrio 18 ""do not yet appear to be a formal part of the transnational drug logistics chain,"" according to the US State Department. Drug routes naturally flow through Mexico's highly disputed southern border region, and Central American gangs would have to work with Mexican organizations in order to use them. But the uptick in the number of detained gang member affiliated with the maras may be more related to increased enforcement, rather than a sign of their expansion into transnational drug trafficking."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Fugitive Italian Latest Foreign Crime Boss Captured in Uruguay. An Italian crime boss and one of Italy's most wanted criminals has been arrested in Uruguay after decades on the run, highlighting another case in which an international criminal has sought refuge in the country. On September 3, authorities arrested Rocco Morabito -- the so-called "" cocaine king "" of the 'Ndrangheta crime organization based in the Calabria region of southwest Italy -- at a hotel in the capital city of Montevideo in southern Uruguay, according to an Interior Ministry press release. Interpol issued a red notice for Morabito in 1994, after he fled the country following his conviction of criminal association, drug trafficking and other serious crimes between 1988 and 1994, according to an Italian Interior Ministry press release. After six months of intelligence gathering, authorities in Uruguay discovered that Morabito had obtained an Uruguayan identification card using a Brazilian passport with a false name. They used this to track his movements and locate him. In two raids at Morabito's home in Punta del Este -- just east of Montevideo and where he had allegedly been living for the past 10 years -- and a storage unit, authorities seized $54,251 in cash, 2,540 Uruguayan pesos (around $88), 150 photos of Morabito with different ""clothes and skin tones,"" as well as a Glock 9 mm pistol, among other things. Morabito was allegedly responsible for organizing logistics for the transport of drug shipments within Italy and distribution in Milan for the 'Ndrangheta -- a violent criminal organization with links to Mexico's Zetas and Gulf Cartel, the "" Tony Montana "" of Peru and several other criminal groups in Latin America, El Pais reported. Specifically, Morabito is accused of attempting to transport 592 kilograms of cocaine from Brazil into Italy in 1992, as well as organize the transport of two cocaine shipments into Italy in 1993, the first of 32 kilograms and the other of 630 kilograms, according to authorities in Uruguay. Rocco Morabito is just the latest case of the region's criminals settling in this Southern Cone nation to elude prosecution or unsuspectingly conduct illicit activities outside of their primary country of operation. In 2016, authorities in Uruguay arrested several suspects linked to Mexico's little-known Los Cuinis crime group, thought to have links to the powerful Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (Cartel de Jalisco - Nueva Generacion). One of the group's members -- who also reportedly lived in Punta del Este -- was thought to have been laundering money for the group through real estate investments in Uruguay. Uruguay's allure comes from the country long being thought of as one of Latin America's safest and least homicidal nations, in addition to being a "" major money laundering "" hub, according to the US State Department's 2017 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report ( INCSR )."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
"US Anti-Gang Operation Shows Complexity of Criminal Landscape. A six-week anti-gang operation headed by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) led to more than 1,300 arrests nationwide. But a breakdown of suspects' alleged affiliations suggests that recent rhetoric may not match reality when it comes to the threat of Latin America-linked gangs in the United States, particularly the MS13. In total, 1,378 arrests were made over the course of six weeks in a nationwide operation led by ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit, according to a news release from the agency. The operation, dubbed ""Project New Dawn,"" was the largest anti-gang crackdown in the agency's history, officials told the Washington Post. Of the 1,378 arrested, 1,098 were detained on ""federal and/or state criminal charges"" such as murder and sexual assault, while the other 280 were arrested on ""administrative immigration violations."" Additionally, 933 of those arrested ""were US citizens,"" while 445 were ""foreign nationals"" from Central and South America, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Caribbean, the news release said. Nearly 80 percent (1,095) of the arrestees were described as gang members or affiliates. ICE said that ""137 were affiliated with the Bloods, 118 with the Surenos, 104 with the Crips and another 104 with the MS13."" The remaining 283 individuals arrested ""claimed no gang affiliation,"" according to the news release. Throughout the six-week operation, HSI and other law enforcement agencies seized ""238 firearms, 22 kilograms of cocaine, 15.5 kilograms of methamphetamine, 3.2 kilograms of heroin, less than a kilogram of fentanyl, 227 kilograms of marijuana and almost $500,000 in US currency."" Operations were carried out around the country with the majority of them in the Houston, New York, Atlanta and Newark, New Jersey areas, according to the news release. Several prominent political figures in the United States have issued repeated warnings recently about the threat posed by Latin America-linked gangs, particularly the MS13. However, HSI's latest operation suggests that the gang problem in the United States is a much more complex issue. In fact, contrary to the implication of this recent rhetoric, only a relatively small fraction of the arrestees allegedly belonged to the MS13 -- less than 10 percent; 104 out of the more than 1,300 total. Other gangs saw more of their alleged members arrested. For instance, 137 suspects were identified with the Bloods, a predominantly, though not exclusively, African-American street gang founded in Los Angeles. The next largest number (108) were identified with the Surenos, a predominantly Mexican-American street gang. Additionally, HSI arrested 104 suspected members of the Crips, another primarily African-American gang that was born in Los Angeles. In other words, the vast majority of those arrested had no alleged affiliation with the MS13. Yet, in many major US media outlets such as CNN , this rhetoric seems to be having an effect, as videos and photos associated with the MS13 were used to illustrate stories about the operation. Despite the fact that relatively few MS13 members were arrested, the gang somehow grabbed the headlines. To be sure, the MS13 does maintain a violent presence in the US, which has been evident most recently in Suffolk County, New York where local police say the gang is behind at least 10 murders. In response, the New York state Senate approved a bill earlier this week targeting the MS13. But the gang landscape in the US is extremely complex, which means the disproportionate attention given to the MS13 may distract from more pressing gang-related problems. For example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) 2015 National Gang Report cited cross-border crime as a significant concern for law enforcement in the United States. And the Surenos, Barrio Azteca and Tango Blast gangs were identified as being the most involved in cross-border crimes, according to the report. While the report indicated that the MS13 was also involved in these crimes, it was not ranked as the primary cross-border threat. (See the FBI's graphic below) The outsized focus on the MS13 likely has more to do with US politics surrounding immigration policy than with the actual threat posed by the gang. For instance, President Donald Trump recently tweeted (incorrectly) that the ""weak illegal immigration policies"" of his predecessor's administration had contributed to the growth of MS13 in the United States. And Attorney General Jeff Sessions claimed that ""years of lax immigration enforcement"" had encouraged gangs to send ""both recruiters and members to regenerate gangs"" by ""smuggling members across the border as unaccompanied minors."" Yet again, the figures from the ICE operation cast doubt on these claims. Nearly 70 percent of those arrested were US citizens. Moreover, only 10 of the more than 1,300 people arrested as part of the operation -- that is, less than 1 percent -- had entered the country as unaccompanied minors. And only eight of those 10 were alleged to be affiliated with the MS13. Trump's administration has essentially made it official policy to paint all immigrants -- particularly those from Mexico and Central America -- as criminals. Consequently, it makes political sense for the president and his allies to promote a narrative that portrays the MS13 as the nation's most severe gang threat. This narrative, however, risks obscuring the threats posed by other gangs, potentially harming broader US anti-gang efforts in the long term."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"5 Ways Trumps Deportation Plan Helps Criminals. In a number of ways, the Trump administration's plan to curb illegal immigration in the United States could facilitate the type of crime that it purports to stop. Backers of the plan appear to be relying more on emotion than evidence to make the argument that President Donald Trump's order to expand the purview of border agents to detain and deport undocumented persons in the United States, and to open the door for an expansion of the border enforcement arm of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will slow the spread of crime and drugs, especially as it relates to the southwest border with Mexico. In an appearance on CNN, former Pinal County, Arizona Sheriff Paul Babeu, for example, repeated false claims that undocumented migrants were responsible for thousands of crimes in the United States, and that Trump's plan was about ""restoring law and order."" As former Labor Secretary and Harvard Professor Robert Reich pointed out during the exchange, migration is dropping, as is crime, in the United States. (See video below of the exchange) Furthermore, immigrants are less likely than native-born citizens to commit violent crimes or be imprisoned. And crime along the US southwest border has been falling over the last few years, including in Pinal County where Babeu was sheriff, according to state data. But the reasons to question this measure go beyond data. The push for stronger enforcement could effectively undermine efforts to slow crime on both sides of the border. Here are five ways this could happen. 1. Loss of intelligence. As much as we would like to think that technology, such as cameras and drones, as well as forensic evidence help solve crimes -- and they do -- law enforcement still relies a great deal on witnesses and other sources to understand criminal dynamics, see patterns and stop crime before it happens. The Trump administration's measure impedes efforts to develop these sources. Using local police to expand the dragnet, as has been proposed, will only distance law enforcement and prosecutors further from potential witnesses and sources. The measure will also impede law enforcement's ability to reconstruct the history of any crime or gain a deep understanding of neighborhoods where there are clusters of undocumented migrants. This includes cases that lead to identifying criminal behavior, such as domestic and child abuse, or illustrate an escalation of criminal behavior. Early intervention via soft measures such as social services or child welfare will also be virtually cut off, making children of migrants even more vulnerable to abuse and increasing the likelihood they get involved in crime later. 2. Increased demand for criminal services. The trickier the border crossing, the more need for professional assistance. That is why migrants turn to professional smugglers known as coyotes -- who work with large, violent trafficking organizations -- to facilitate these crossings. This will only increase as the US government tightens law enforcement and expands the border wall, says Guadelupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley and current fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""This will definitely strengthen criminal networks (both smugglers and traffickers) on the Mexican side of the border,"" she said in an email exchange. ""The massive deportations that will take place in the near future will only worsen things, and this will be a fantastic business for migrant smugglers who hold very close connections with drug cartels that operate in northeastern Mexico, particularly along the Tamaulipas (state) border with Texas. ""Many will try to return to the United States, as they are currently doing and paying the smugglers and Mexican-origin TCOs [Transnational Criminal Organizations] to facilitate their return. Sometimes they are willing to work for these organizations, and they get involved in the business of human trafficking, migrant smuggling and drug trafficking as well. Some of them do not have resources or connections in Mexico who can provide them with resources to pay the fees the cartels and the smugglers ask for. Sometimes they are forced to work for the groups in control of these criminal activities in the different plazas."" Proponents of increased enforcement like Babeu cite more availability of heroin and its deadly cousin, fentanyl, as reasons to support the measure. To be sure, much of the heroin production is now in Mexico, and a good deal of the fentanyl appears to be originating in China and coming through Mexico. And migrants are involved in the trade in the United States. However, as Sam Quinones -- a long time journalist and author who lived in Mexico for 10 years -- noted in a New York Times/Marshall Project editorial about Trump's proposed extension of the border wall, these new measures will do little to stem the flow of heroin. ""Walls have not stopped drugs, especially heroin,"" Quinones wrote. ""It is the easiest drug to traffic in small batches across a border because it is so easily condensed -- and easy to cut later."" Finally, these US efforts to target undocumented migrants also miss the mark when it comes to the United States' own capacity to foment and export crime and violence. As Quinones notes in Dreamland , his incredible book on the heroin epidemic in the United States, it was US demand for the over-the-counter opioid-based painkillers and the systematic overprescription of those medications that led to the heroin and fentanyl scourge. In addition, it is the availability of US weapons that facilitates the violent confrontations between large and small criminal groups in Mexico (and, of course, in the United States as well). 3. More targets for corruption. The Trump administration says it will try to hire at least 5,000 new agents for Customs and Border Protection (CBP). It would be the second massive increase in a decade: Between 2006 and 2012, the CBP more than doubled in size from about 10,000 to 21,000. That expansion had its problems. James Tomsheck, the former head of internal affairs for the CBP, told National Public Radio that the CBP had no polygraph test and that when it did implement one in 2008, more than half of the applicants failed the exam. ""It was what these applicants had done in the past that most concerned us,"" he said. ""They included serious felony crimes, active involvement in smuggling activities, and several confirmed infiltrators who actually were employed by drug trafficking organizations who had been directed to seek out positions within Customs and Border Protection to advance ongoing criminal conspiracies -- essentially be spies in our midst."" The Center for Investigative Reporting did a series of reports , which chronicled many of these cases and mapped the extent of this infiltration. It found that close to 150 CBP personnel had been charged with or convicted for corruption between 2004 and 2014. 4. Less remittances. Migrants in the United States send billions of dollars back in remittances to their countries of origin that largely sustain the economies of those countries. Many of the countries that rely on these remittances are also the most crime-ridden and gang-infested nations in the region. These include El Salvador ($4 billion per year), Guatemala ($6 billion per year), Honduras ($3.3 billion per year), and Mexico ($24 billion per year). Even a partial loss of these remittances could lead to economic hardship and more criminal activity, which could lead to more migration. 5. Less international cooperation. The message the Trump administration has sent to the world is clear: US-born citizens first. And for Trump and his myopic followers like Babeu, the measure is a step in the right direction. But the political costs of this position are extremely high. Trump's go-it-alone strategy is already causing rifts between key allies like Mexico and the above-mentioned Northern Triangle countries, which, according to the Migration Policy Institute, account for almost 15 million migrants in the United States. When thousands of unaccompanied youth from these countries -- many of whom were fleeing crime and violence -- flooded the US border in 2013 and 2014, the United States worked with these countries to develop a plan to provide assistance to stem the violence. While that plan appears to be moving forward, the criminalization of entire nationalities does not bode well for future cooperation in matters like this. This is critical since, as 2016 data compiled by American University's Center for Latin American and Latino Studies shows (see below), this trend appears to be on the rise again."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Spain Arrests, Drug Seizures Signal Colombia Cocaine Boom Could Hit Europe. Authorities in Spain seized over one ton of cocaine from a Colombian drug trafficking network and arrested dozens of its members, a potential sign that the surge in Colombia's cocaine production is altering trafficking patterns in yet another part of the world. Spain's National Police captured 24 members of a Colombian drug trafficking group that was seeking to establish a new maritime route into Spain, reported EFE. The operation, which was carried out last weekend, also reportedly netted a seizure of 2,400 kilograms of cocaine. ""It is one of the most important operations against cocaine trafficking that has been carried out in Spain in recent years, not just because of the large quantity of drugs, but because of the number of people detained, some of whom are very important in international cocaine trafficking,"" said Ricardo Toro, the Director of the Special Response Group for Organized Crime. ""If [the authorities] hadn't triumphed with their operation, they probably would have installed themselves here, in Galicia and in other parts of Spain,"" Toro continued. The investigation began in June 2016, according to EFE, when Spanish authorities identified a known Colombian drug trafficker who was attempting to open a permanent ""oficina,"" or office, in Madrid. More recently, the Spanish Civil Guard arrested 12 alleged members of a drug trafficking ring in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, a city in one of the Canary Islands off the northwestern coast of Africa. Most of the suspects are of Colombian, Lithuanian, and Ukrainian nationality, and are allegedly responsible for smuggling close to 400 kilograms of cocaine into Europe, EFE reported separately. The raid of a Colombian drug ring in Spain is not exactly revelatory; the country has long served as the entry point for Colombian traffickers seeking a way into the lucrative European drug market. In 2014, Spanish police told InSight Crime that Colombians had set up between 12 and 20 ""oficinas de cobro,"" which are criminal structures that are often involved in drug trafficking and money laundering. Still, the amount of cocaine seized and the number of Colombians involved suggests Spain may be beginning to feel the effects of spiking cocaine production back in Colombia. Both the United Nations and the United States have registered significant increases in coca cultivation in recent years, and US officials recently told El Tiempo they believe there is now more coca being sown in Colombian soil than at any other point in the country's history. There are already indications that the huge rise in cocaine production has impacted trafficking patterns in Latin America and consumption habits in the United States. A recent report by the US State Department linked Colombia's cocaine boom to greater availability and usage of the drug in the United States, something that hasn't been seen in nearly a decade. Seizures are also on the upswing in Central America and Mexico, as are confiscations of multi-ton cocaine shipments , which had become increasingly rare in recent years. But with the amount of cocaine now flooding the market, it appears traffickers are willing to take bigger risks by sending larger shipments to more profitable markets like the United States and Europe."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Rising Seizures along Pacific Signal Shift in Colombias Drug Routes. Drug seizures along Colombia's Pacific coast have shot up this year, indicating a possible shift in internal drug trafficking routes as security crackdowns and peace negotiations reshape the country's underworld. Between January and May 2016, authorities seized 34 tons of drugs -- worth around $1 billion -- in Colombia's Pacific region, according to official figures reported by Colprensa. Seizures have reportedly increased by 65 percent compared to the same time period last year. Local marines were responsible for seizing 15 tons, up from the 6.1 tons they confiscated during the first five months of 2015, Commander of the Pacific Naval Force Pablo Guevara said. The remaining drugs were reportedly seized with the collaboration of other countries, including the United States. The Urabenos criminal organization are among those hardest hit by the interdiction operations in the Pacific, according to authorities. The Navy attributed the increase in seizures to improved intelligence and training, while recognizing that a rise in drug crops in the area was also a factor. ""There has been an increase in illicit cultivations in [the department of] Putumayo and the Pacific, due to suspended aerial fumigation and manual eradication,"" Guevara said. Five semi-submersibles, also known as ""narco-submarines,"" were discovered in the Pacific region over the same time period. According to Mexico's El Universal , a total of seven semi-submersibles have been taken out of circulation so far this year in Colombia, all of which belonged to the Urabenos. Although the increasing efficiency of interdiction efforts along the Pacific may partly explain the rise in seizures, this trend is more likely the result of a phenomenon known as the ""balloon effect"" in which criminal groups migrate from one area to another as a result of increased pressure from the authorities. Colombia's largest drug trafficking organization, the Urabenos, have come under intense pressure in their traditional stronghold of Uraba on the Caribbean coast. In February 2015, the government launched ""Operation Agamemnon"" and deployed over a thousand troops to the group's main drug trafficking hub. As a result, the Urabenos have shifted some of their drug operations southwest to the Pacific coast. But this has brought them into conflict with armed groups already established in the region. In just the Pacific department of Choco -- where a number of the most recent cocaine seizures have taken place -- there are several active fronts of the country's two principal guerrilla groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) and the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN). The region has already seen clashes between the Urabenos and the ELN, which have led to the displacement of thousands of locals. In Narino, too, drug trafficking organizations have been fighting the FARC, who control the drug trade in the department. Narino is one of the biggest coca producers in the country and a key departure point for drugs heading to the United States. According to Dialogo , Narino's Sanquianga Park is the most popular launching pad for Colombia's narco-submarines. There have also been reports of clashes between the ELN and criminal bands, or ""BACRIM,"" in the Pacific department of Cauca."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Four Mexicans Arrested in Meth Super Lab Bust in Nigeria. Officials in Nigeria have arrested four Mexican nationals who allegedly helped create a ""super lab"" for producing large amounts of synthetic methamphetamine, potentially signaling a new level of drug trafficking sophistication in West Africa. Mitchell Ofoyeju, spokesman for Nigeria's National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), confirmed authorities had arrested eight men -- four of whom were Mexican -- allegedly responsible for running the meth lab in Nigeria's southern Delta state, reported the Associated Press (AP). According to the AP, the lab was capable of producing 4,000 kilograms of methamphetamine a week, with Ofoyeju saying it was the first industrial-scale production of meth found in West Africa, possibly even the African continent. (Methamphetamine labs were first discovered in Nigeria in 2011, and several small-scale labs have been dismantled since.) The lab was designed to produce a type of synthetic methamphetamine that does not require ephedrine, a common precursor chemical typically found in cough medicine, reported YNaija , a local news source. This style of the drug requires a more complicated and sophisticated production process, with Ofoyeju saying the ""Nigerians invited the Mexicans in to leverage their expertise in these industrial-scale, high-yield productions."" The arrests were the result of undercover work that led to simultaneous raids in three cities, including Lagos, Nigeria's largest city. At the time of the raid, the lab was producing its second batch of methamphetamine, and 1.5 kilograms of meth and 750 liters of liquid methamphetamine were seized, reported the AP. Investigations indicated the lab had a successful test production in February. The drugs produced at the lab were reportedly destined for Asia, mainly Singapore and Malaysia, where the drugs sell for as much as $300,000 a kilogram (compared to $6,000 in Nigeria). Perhaps most notable about the discovery of the ""super lab"" in Nigeria is the direct involvement of alleged drug production experts from Mexico. Indeed, the hiring of Latin American methamphetamine ""consultants,"" and the lab's industrial-scale production capability, may signify a notable shift in West Africa's role in transnational drug trafficking. Previously, the region has been an important transit hub for Latin American cocaine destined for Europe. Now, however, it appears homegrown West African criminal networks are looking to dramatically increase their involvement not just in drug smuggling , but in drug production as well. Following the raid, NDLEA spokesmen Ofoyeju said Nigerian-produced methamphetamine is becoming increasingly competitive in Asian and South African drug markets, and that local drug networks are shifting to more complex production processes. Signs of the increasing sophistication of local drug organizations ring alarm bells in a region that has struggled to contain the corrupting influence of drug trafficking, with Guinea-Bissau perhaps the most emblematic case of the threat drug traffickers pose to West African nations."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Arrests Show Arrival of Barrio 18 Gang in Italy. The recent capture of alleged Barrio 18 gang members in Italy confirms the spread of the Central American mara gangs in Europe, but questions remains as to whether this means they are now truly transnational criminal organizations. Italian police arrested 15 suspected Barrio 18 members in Milan and other nearby cities in northern Italy, reported AFP. The group -- which was mostly comprised of Salvadorans but also reportedly included two Italians -- is accused of crimes including extortion, drug trafficking, armed robbery and the attempted murder of a rival from the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) gang. An Italian judge ordered the arrests following an investigation that began in January 2014 after a female Salvadoran accused one of the group's members of sexually assaulting her, according to AFP. Central American gangs like Barrio 18 and MS13, which are known as ""maras,"" have been operating in Italy for years, particularly in northern immigrant communities, the report added. Over the last two years, security forces in both Italy and Spain have noted the expansion of the MS13 in Europe, and these latest report confirms they are not alone -- their great rivals in Barrio 18 have also crossed the ocean. The key question surrounding this development is whether the spread is a result of Central American migrants bringing mara street gang culture with them and setting up autonomous networks, or whether these new European based factions are running criminal operations with maras in Central America, suggesting the gangs have made the leap into transnational organizations. Both gangs are also well established in parts of the United States and the US government has already designated the MS13 a transnational criminal organization, ranking them alongside criminal groups such as the Mexican cartels. However, despite evidence of cross-border collaboration in criminal activities, the decentralized nature and highly localized and territorial focus of the maras has always cast doubts on this classification. There have also been reports of the Spanish maras coordinating with their counterparts in the Americas, but even if this level of cooperation were to expand, it is unlikely they would have the capacity to coordinate serious transatlantic criminal operations. If they were to seek to establish control over transnational activities such as drug trafficking in Europe, they also would likely encounter formidable opposition; in Spain drug trafficking and associated activities such as contract killing is largely controlled by offshoots of Colombian cartels , while Italy is the domain of powerful and well-connected mafias such as the 'Ndrangheta."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Prosecutors Alarmed Over Argentinas Growing Drug Trade. Judicial officials in Argentina are sounding the alarm over the spread of drug trafficking and organized crime in the country, a rare admission from authorities of the country's growing role in nearly every aspect of the drug trade. In a new report by Argentina's Attorney General's Office, federal and regional prosecutors expressed their growing concern over the proliferation of drug trafficking activity throughout the country. Mario Sabas Herrera, Attorney General of the central city General Roca, declared, ""The Argentine Republic lives with a criminal business that produces massive incomes: drug trafficking."" Sabas Herrera went on to warn, ""This phenomenon has been gradually penetrating our societysurprising by its speed, to the point that today it controls the lives of the inhabitants of many neighborhoods."" Pablo Di Loreto, a federal prosecutor in the northern city of Posadas, found that ""seizures of numerous cocaine or coca base shipments during the past year from Paraguay"" have been particularly alarming. The concern, in part, owes to the smuggling routes being used, which have traditionally been used for marijuana, not cocaine trafficking. Loreto also highlighted the presence of ""better organized criminal structures that divide labor and criminal tasks,"" with different groups buying, transporting, preparing, and selling drugs. This complicates investigations due to the number of groups involved at each step in the drug trafficking chain, the report notes. Federal prosecutor Juan Carlos Tesoriero also drew attention to a ""notable increase"" in cocaine trafficking in Posadas, which has resulted in ""the multiplication of drug-sale points in cities and towns in [Argentina's] interior."" Likewise, Eduardo Villalba, an Attorney General in the northwest province of Salta, said a rise in drug-related crimes has been ""notable"" in comparison with previous years, and that micro-trafficking operations have rapidly increased. Salta is a key entry point into Argentina for cocaine shipments coming from Bolivia, according to the report. Similarly, Enrique Senestrari, a federal prosecutor from Cordoba, referred to an increase in the number of ""drug kitchens,"" with another prosecutor also noting that drug production ""has proliferated"" in the province of Mendoza. The recognition by top judicial authorities of Argentina's growing drug problem highlights the extent and seriousness of the issue -- which some government officials have previously been reluctant to acknowledge or admit. Even Pope Francis -- who is Argentine -- has grown worried about the potential ""Mexicanization"" of Argentina, which has become an increasingly important drug consumer, transit, and even producer nation. It is no coincidence Argentina is experiencing growth in several different aspects of the drug trade at the same time; these trends are often linked and can in fact create a snow-ball effect. For example, the country's growing role as a transit nation for international markets such as Europe has likely increased its own domestic demand for illicit drugs. The growth of local drug markets has in turn led to an increased number of criminal groups dedicated to micro-trafficking , with the Monos in the city of Rosario serving as the most prominent example of this phenomenon. As a result, drug-related violence has risen as competing criminal groups battle for territorial control. Foreign drug trafficking organizations have also moved into Argentina, which is seen by some as a safe haven compared to the security pressures applied to organized crime groups in Colombia or Mexico. The presence of these transnational criminal networks has expedited Argentina's rising importance in the drug trade, and there is evidence groups such as Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel have contributed to growing corruption within the country's police forces. Despite the dire warning signs, until now government officials -- either for lack of will or resources -- have been slow to tackle these drug-related issues. The report by the Attorney General's Office is a clarion call to action -- but it remains to be seen if authorities will take the necessary steps to reverse course."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
ETA Terrorist Group Leaders Allegedly on Venezuela Government Payroll. Two leaders of Spain's Basque separatist group hiding out in Venezuela allegedly receive salaries from state entities, marking the latest accusations that the Venezuelan government aids and abets terrorist organizations. According to Spanish news agency El Confidencial , Xabier Arruti Imaz -- an alleged leader of Spain's Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) separatist group -- is on the payroll of Gas Comunal SA, a subsidiary of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA. El Confidencial reportedly accessed records from Venezuela's social security institute which show that Arruti receives a salary worth around $1,860 dollars a month (more than double the minimum wage) despite not having any experience working in the oil industry. Arruti has also reportedly served as a representative of Venezuela's official socialist party (PSUV) in the northwest state of Falcon and owns a restaurant on Venezuela's Caribbean Coast. Jose Arturo Cubillas Fontan -- another ETA leader who fled to Venezuela in the 1980s -- is also allegedly on the government's payroll, receiving a salary from Venezuela's state food company, reported El Confidencial. Cubillas, who is wanted in Spain on terrorism charges, has reportedly served as a contact between the ETA and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group. Cubillas received around $1,025 dollars a month in 2014 from the state food company, according to the social security records accessed by El Confidencial. Recent attention to the presence of ETA members in Venezuela is due to media reports that surfaced in February stating that ETA leader Ignacio de Juana Chaos -- who fled Northern Ireland in 2010 while appealing an extradition order -- lives in northern Venezuela and is allowed to move freely around the country. Venezuela has long been accused of financing and supporting terrorist and criminal groups. Perhaps most notable is the Venezuelan government's links with Colombia's FARC guerrillas , who have used the neighboring country as a refuge. Indeed, Venezuelan officials have repeatedly been accused by the US government of helping the FARC to traffic cocaine and of providing the group with weapons. Colombia's National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas have also used Venezuela to regroup and escape pressure from Colombian security forces. Additionally, past reports have alleged that the Venezuelan government has aided the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. As for the ETA, Venezuela has reportedly served as one of the most important sanctuaries for the group since it was founded in the late 1950s. Currently there are an estimated 40 ETA members residing in the country.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Peru Traffickers Running Cocaine Labs in Buenos Aires: Report. A report on the drug trade in Argentina offers new evidence of the country's role in cocaine production, alleging that capital city Buenos Aires is home to numerous cocaine laboratories run by a Peruvian criminal network. On March 19, the Argentinean NGO Fundacion La Alameda presented a report titled "" The Narco Laboratories of the City ,"" which states that there are at least 10 cocaine laboratories in the Bajo Flores neighborhood of Buenos Aires, reported La Nacion. According to the report, over 300 heavily armed guards -- many of whom are former members of Peru's Shining Path guerrilla group and former Peruvian security forces -- protect these labs, which are capable of producing 10 kilos of cocaine per day and can be dismantled in around 30 minutes. The criminal group that oversees the labs allegedly imports coca paste from Bolivia and Peru , and is run by a former Shining Path guerrilla named Marcos Antonio Estrada Gonzalez, alias ""Marcos"". The criminal group is allegedly able to conduct some of its operations only a few kilometers from the President's Office, which the authors of the report argue is largely attributable to the breakdown of the Federal Police and the ineffectiveness (and sometimes complicity) of the Ministry of National Security. Gustavo Vera, the head of La Alameda, said during a press conference that the NGO decided to publish the report due to the ""complete inaction of the judiciary and Ministry of Security,"" reported La Nacion. The results of La Alameda's investigation -- which apparently prompted Pope Francis' comments about the ""Mexicanization"" of Argentina in February -- provide further indications that Argentina is becoming an increasingly important drug production center. While coca base moving from Bolivia into Argentina to feed the domestic market for ""basuco"" -- a form of crack cocaine -- is nothing new, reports of large-scale cocaine laboratories in Buenos Aires appear to be a relatively recent phenomenon. Cocaine labs have previously been discovered in Argentina's Patagonia region and near the border with Bolivia as well as in a smaller city in Buenos Aires province. Furthermore, the fact that Peruvians are allegedly responsible for running the cocaine laboratories speaks to the level of infiltration transnational criminal elements -- lured by increased profits from the country's growing domestic demand for drugs and access to foreign markets -- have obtained in Argentina. As stated in the report, critics argue that despite mounting public concerns Argentinean authorities have not adopted adequate measures to tackle the drug trade, and have consistently denied that Argentina is a drug producing nation."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Colombians Use Chemical Expertise to Move Cocaine into Spain. Police in Spain have dismantled a multinational drug trafficking network led by Colombians that is the latest example of how traffickers use sophisticated chemical processes to disguise cocaine shipments. In raids in five Spanish provinces police arrested five Spaniards, five Colombians, a Nigerian and a Peruvian. They also seized 229 kilos of cocaine, along with arms, chemicals and lab equipment. The network was allegedly moving cocaine into Spain disguised in palm kernel meal, a brownish powder used in animal feed. Police say the group, which authorities said was led by a Colombian national and had operatives based in Spain, brought a Colombian chemist into the country specifically for the extraction process. The operation was the culmination of an investigation that began in 2013 after Colombian and US investigators tipped off the Spanish authorities over the operations of Colombian traffickers in the country. Spanish local media suggest the network was processing coca base into cocaine. But it appears the chemicals and lab equipment were employed to extract the powdered cocaine hydrochloride from the palm kernel meal the traffickers used to disguise the drugs. Such sophisticated methods of disguising cocaine are becoming ever more apparent, with this case following the seizure of nearly three tons of cocaine disguised in oil used for electrical transformers in the Colombian port of Cartagena earlier this year. As in this case, this often involves exporting knowledge as well as drugs. In Bolivia, for example, where Colombians run many of the cocaine processing and trafficking operations, underworld sources have told InSight Crime that one of the most popular trafficking techniques is now to spray liquid cocaine onto clothes. The case is also a reminder of the growing influence in Spain of Colombian networks, which appear to retain control over the market despite the widely reported incursion of Mexican groups. Sources in the Spanish police have told InSight Crime that the Colombians control the cocaine trade in the country and that there are between 12 and 20 of the Colombian criminal structures known as ""oficinas de cobro"" (""collection offices,"" which act as unofficial arbiters of the underworld) active in the country. Police also said they are braced for the Colombian presence to increase further when visa restrictions are eased next year."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Has Rios Pacification Simply Pushed Crime to the City Limits?Officials in the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area are increasingly complaining that the so-called ""pacification"" of favelas is displacing violence to the city's periphery. The hard evidence for this claim, however, is scarce. Rio de Janeiro's security strategy has made some impressive gains since the state government first rolled out the pacification program in 2008. In the neighborhoods where Police Pacification Units (UPPs) have been installed, local criminal control has been broken and murder rates have dropped considerably. While allegations of abuse and the number of residents killed in police crossfire have drawn attention to its shortcomings, pacification is generally held up as a success story. At the same time, however, it has drawn criticism from some who say that rather than solving Rio's crime problem, the program is pushing violent drug gangs outside the city and into surrounding municipalities. This narrative is commonly invoked in media coverage of crime in the Rio area, with local papers reporting on the apparent "" migration "" of gangs to the city's periphery. It has also become popular among officials in the Baixada Fluminense region, a section of the northern Rio metropolitan area that includes smaller cities like Duque de Caxias and Nova Iguacu. Luiz Antunes, Nova Iguacu's security secretary, recently told journalists that, ""Violence has invaded the Baixada Fluminense."" Duque de Caxias Mayor Alexandre Cardoso has repeatedly referred to an uptick in crime in his city as the result of Rio's pacification. Lindberg Farias, a candidate for Rio state governor in October's elections, has made the same criticism of the UPPs. The specifics of the argument vary, but one of the most common claims is that the increased police presence of Rio's favelas has pushed gang leaders to relocate to slums outside the city. Supporters of the idea point to the fact that while violent crime has reduced in the city, in the Baixada it has increased drastically in recent years. In Nova Iguacu, for example, officials registered 310 murders from January to May 2014, almost twice the 177 seen in the same period in 2008. At least partially in response to this perception, the state government is taking steps to expand the pacification strategy beyond the city borders of Rio de Janeiro. In July, authorities set up the first UPP in the Baixada Fluminense -- and the first one outside of the city -- in the Duque de Caxias neighborhood of Complexo da Mangueirinha. Another UPP, in the bordering municipality of Belford Roxo, will be established in October. Current Governor Luiz Fernando Pezao has said that if he emerges victorious from October's election, he intends to open up several new pacification units outside of Rio. On the campaign trail, he has promised to not only establish UPPs in every municipality in the Baixada Fluminense, but also in the neighboring city of Niteroi. While the media and some officials in the metropolitan area have accepted the claim that pacification has spread violent crime to Rio's surrounding municipalities, the hard proof for it simply isn't there. For one thing, the criminal ""migration"" theory has been flatly rejected by the office of the Rio de Janeiro State Secretary of Security (SESEG). According to a November 2013 SESEG report, the vast majority of suspects arrested on drug trafficking-related charges in the Baixada from January to August of last year were locals. Just 5.6 percent of suspects were residents of the city of Rio de Janeiro. What's more, asserting that the violence in the Baixada was ""pushed in"" ignores the fact that it has never been particularly peaceful in the first place. In reality, the area has long been home to some of Rio's most infamous criminal groups, like the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) and Pure Third Command (Terceiro Comando Puro). As security expert Ignacio Cano of the Violence Analysis Laboratory told newspaper Extra when asked to comment on the issue: ""The displacement would only be meaningful if criminals were going to areas where there weren't any gangs."" The fact is that the municipalities that ring Rio de Janeiro have traditionally witnessed higher rates of violence than the city itself. From 2002 to 2006, before the word ""pacification"" had even entered Brazil's political discourse, official data shows the average homicide rate in Duque de Caxias was 81.5 per 100,000 residents. Nova Iguacu's was 64.2, and Belford Roxo's was 55.2. All of these were higher than the average homicide rate in Rio for the same period, which was 44.8. It is true, however, that homicides are increasing in the municipalities of the metropolitan area (excluding Rio) after a period of decline from 2008 to 2012. Brazilian researcher Joana Monteiro points this out in a very useful analysis of crime statistics released by the Rio de Janeiro Public Security Institute. Nevertheless, the data doesn't support the idea that crime is shifting to the city's periphery. As Monteiro notes, the number of so-called ""crimes against property"" (a category which includes extortion, theft and muggings) has consistently been far higher in the city than in the outer municipalities since 2007, though such crimes appear to be on the rise in both. So if pacification hasn't caused some kind of mass criminal exodus from Rio, why is violence in the Baixada Fluminense on the rise? The answer likely has to do with the simple lack of police presence. In 2012 the 13 municipalities that make up the region had, between them, just 2,910 military police officers operating there. At the time, this was 20 percent less than the number of police stationed in UPPs in Rio. As R7 reported , this breaks down to a police-to-resident ratio of one officer for every 1,254 people, compared to one to 478 in the city itself."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
Paraguay Uncovers Multinational Group Linked to Domestic Cocaine Processing. Authorities in Paraguay have reported the presence of a multinational drug trafficking organization that processes cocaine domestically and flies it to the Brazil border, in a case underlining the country's growing role in the regional drug trade. The group -- made up of Colombians, Bolivians and Paraguayans and allegedly based in the city of Pedro Juan Caballero, near the Brazilian border -- is believed to source cocaine from Colombia and transport it first to Bolivia. They then fly the product from the southern Bolivian state of Santa Cruz into the northern Paraguayan region of Chaco, and finally on to the border states of Amambay and Canindeyu, from where the drugs are transported overland to Brazil and exported to Europe, reported ABC Color. The operation was uncovered following the recent recovery of 292 kilos of cocaine in the Boqueron province , part of the Chaco region. According to authorities, the group is also responsible for a cocaine processing laboratory found in February in Palmar de las Islas, near the border with Bolivia. The site was allegedly used to process cocaine paste from Bolivia in order to save time and money by cutting out the Colombian leg of the journey, reported ABC. Following the recent seizure, the head of Paraguay's anti-drug agency SENAD, Luis Rojas, declared the country is no longer just a cocaine transit nation, but is also now a processing venue. The latest discovery reinforces the notion that Paraguay is gaining importance in the transnational drug trade, something also evidenced by its conversion into a drug processing center and an increasingly heavy presence of Brazilian organized crime groups. The cocaine lab near the Bolivian border was the third to be found in Paraguay in little over a year, after two were discovered near the Brazilian border in early 2013. With Brazilian criminal groups firmly established throughout the border area , it is very possible this multinational group was collaborating with Brazilians once the drugs reached the frontier. A variety of factors could explain the shifting of processing to Paraguay, among them rampant corruption and the country's status as a hub for illicit products, which likely facilitates the flow of precursor chemicals. Ciudad del Este, in the country's infamous Triple Frontier region with Brazil and Argentina, is a key spot for contraband, while the southwestern border is located near routes between Argentina and Bolivia used to traffic both drugs and precursor chemicals.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"East Paraguay Killings Linked to Brazil Criminal Battle. A spate of murders in the Paraguay-Brazil border region has been attributed to a turf war between Brazilian-led criminal groups, in another sign of the infiltration of foreign organized crime into the country. At least eight killings committed in or around the border city of Pedro Juan Caballero, capital of the state of Amambay, since early January have been linked to a battle for control of this key drug trafficking corridor, reported ABC. According to ABC, a group led by alias ""Rafad,"" a Brazilian of Arab origin, has clashed with another led by Ivan Mendes Mesquita, a Brazilian national previously extradited from Paraguay to the United States , where he was recently released after serving jail time for drug trafficking. Among the murders linked to the rivalry are those of two former Brazilian police officers and that of a Chilean dentist. In one case, the body of a Brazilian man registered as living in the municipality of Ponta Pora -- which sits across the border from Pedro Juan Caballero -- was dumped on Paraguayan territory , and the site of his murder remains unknown. In another case, a Brazilian business owner operating on Paraguayan territory was gunned down by assassins on a motorbike , who subsequently escaped in the direction of Brazil. This string of homicides in Pedro Juan Caballero is just the latest sign of the growing influence of Brazilian criminal groups in Paraguay, which is a significant transit route for cocaine heading to the Brazilian market or on to Europe, as well as South America's primary marijuana producer. Earlier this month, Paraguay's anti-drug chief, Luis Rojas, identified this city as one of the places where a Brazilian presence had been particularly noted. According to Rojas, groups such as the First Capital Command (PCC), Red Command (CV) and Amigos dos Amigos are vying for control in the border region. In January, a prominent clergyman denounced the ""Brazilianization"" of the state of Concepcion , which borders Amambay, with Brazilian criminals apparently buying swathes of land in order to use ranches as a cover for drug trafficking. Two months earlier, four members of a reported ""armed wing"" of the PCC were captured in Pedro Juan Caballero. While it remains unclear which of the larger organizations the rival Brazilian groups may be affiliated with, Ivan Mendes has previously been linked to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla organization, and according to ABC, has ties to Europe and the United States."	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Colombia Seizes Historic 7 Tn Cocaine Load Destined for Europe. Authorities in Colombia have seized a record seven ton shipment of cocaine destined for the Netherlands in the northern Caribbean port of Cartagena, a haul likely linked to the Urabenos, who are feeding the European market. Members of the antinarcotics police discovered the shipment on April 8. Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon said they found the cocaine aboard a ship destined for the Dutch port of Rotterdam, reported AFP. The nearly seven ton shipment was hidden in a container carrying pineapple pulp, according to RCN. ""This is perhaps one of the biggest drug seizures in the history of Cartagena,"" Pinzon said. According to Reuters , this is the largest cocaine haul in Colombia since 2008, when 10.5 tons of cocaine was found in the nearby port of Barranquilla. With the most recent seizure, some 13 tons of cocaine have been found in Colombia's ports so far in 2014, already surpassing last year's annual total of nine tons, reported El Tiempo. As Mexican drug cartels have grown to dominate the United States cocaine market, Colombian criminal groups have looked to Europe as an alternative market. Spain has traditionally been the principal point of entry for drug shipments, but Holland and Belgium have also become important entry points for Colombian cocaine , which is often shipped out of Ecuadorean ports. Although the Mexicans have also begun to challenge Colombia's domination in Europe , Colombia's fragmented Rastrojos criminal group appear to retain a significant presence in Spain , and there are signs Colombia's dominant criminal organization, the Urabenos, are developing a significant interest in the continent. A suspected Urabenos leader arrested in Spain last year allegedly planned to set up new drug routes and an ""oficina de cobro"" debt collection structure, while news reports in August 2013 linked four tons of Europe-bound cocaine seized in Ecuador to the group. It is highly probable the most recent shipment seized belonged to the Urabenos. Cartagena is the capital of Bolivar state, which was once the stomping ground of former Oficina de Envigado head Maximiliano Bonilla, alias ""Valenciano,"" and the Paisas criminal group. However, Valenciano was arrested in 2011 , and the majority of Paisas members have since defected to the Urabenos, leaving the territory largely under their control. The massive seizure comes as Europe prepares to lift the Schengen Area visa requirements that currently restrict the passage of Colombians (and Peruvians) through the region, a development which could further facilitate the expansion of the Urabenos and Colombian organized crime."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
Mexico Justice Department Flags Growing Mara Presence. An easing of tension among the largest Mexican criminal groups has been counteracted by the growing influx of Central America's most notorious gangs, a development that, if continued, could challenge efforts to improve Mexican security for years to come. As reported by El Diario , a new report from Mexico's Justice Department details the growing links between the Central American Maras and the nation's principal criminal groups. Gangs like Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha perform a range of services for gangs like the Zetas, the Knights Templar, and the Familia Michoacana. In so doing, the Maras in Mexico operate in coordination with their gang counterparts in Central America. This mirrors the expansion of the larger Mexican groups like the Zetas into the isthmus over the past several years, and illustrates the degree to which organized crime in Latin America is a cross-border phenomenon. The report indicates that the gangs serve as foot soldiers helping the larger groups control territory. Their presence has been most evident in southern states, among them Chiapas, Guerrero, Colima, Morelos, and Mexico State. The report says that there up to 70 different Mara cells operating in Mexico. The presence of Central American actors in Mexico is not without precedent. The southern border between Chiapas and Guatemala has long had a significant presence of Maras, who participate in the human trafficking trade. Guatemalan ex-special forces, known as Kaibiles, emerged as allies of the Zetas in the early years of the Calderon administration. The Kaibiles, who participated in the Guatemalan civil war that left hundreds of thousands dead, are often blamed for escalating the level of brutality among the Mexican groups; for instance, the surge of decapitations and public mutilations in Mexico coincided with their incursion. Groups like the maras fit with the Mexican groups' shifting tactics and objectives of recent years. A mass of young and violent Central Americans may not be vital to producing methamphetamine or trafficking cocaine, but they would give Mexican gangs the manpower to control a given territory. This in turn could be used as another revenue source, as local businesses are forced to pay protection fees. The Mara allies could also work with the Mexicans to move undocumented immigrants across the US border, a realm of growing importance to the organized crime groups. Maras would also give Mexican groups a ready supply of foot soldiers should it find itself in a protracted struggle with rivals, a frequent occurrence in recent years. Since the reporting is short on details, it is not entirely clear how deep the relationship between the traffickers and the Maras has grown, nor that they will continue working together into the future. It also remains to be seen what impact this relationship has on violence in Mexico, but it is unlikely to be positive. One reason is that the business activities that the Maras specialize in lend themselves to violence, even more so than drug trafficking. One cannot extort without the threat of violence, and the trafficking of undocumented immigrants in recent years has been characterized by kidnappings and massacres. And insofar as they serve as foot soldiers, the Maras can help perpetuate violent conflicts between Mexican groups. Furthermore, the arrival of another group of criminal actors, whose interests will invariably collide with other established gangs and who will essentially be trying to carve a slice out of a pie of limited size, inevitably serves as a complicating factor. It remains to be seen if the presence of the Maras is a blip in a soon-to-be-forgotten report or if it is part of a broader trend, but if it is the latter, it is unfortunate news. The greater role of the Maras is consistent with the super gang theory posited by Southern Pulse. This theory, which was first elaborated in 2012, holds that less organized street gangs will take on a larger role in Mexico, and they will soon be the primary drivers of violence. Evidence supporting this paradigm has emerged across Mexico, including many of its most persistently violent cities, and goes well beyond whatever role the Maras play. Should the report's findings represent a long-term development, the super gang theory would seem to be significantly closer to reality. It is almost inevitable that this cross pollination of criminal expertise will also lead to a growth in sophistication of the Maras.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Colombia Hitman Arrested in Spain Was Rastrojos Europe Link. A hitman from Colombia arrested in Spain for a double homicide in Holland allegedly acted as a link between the Rastrojos and European criminal groups, in a further sign of the penetration of Colombian organized crime into Europe. Juan Alejandro Roldan Puentes, alias ""Nino,"" was arrested in Madrid following a joint operation by Colombian, Spanish and Dutch authorities. He is accused of killing two Colombians in Amsterdam in May 2013 over a $270,000 drug debt owed to an unidentified trafficker known as ""Talisman,"" reported El Tiempo. Roldan had lived in Spain for two years and, according to Colombia's National Police Director Rodolfo Palomino, formed part of a network of hitmen working for the Rastrojos drug trafficking organization and linked to the Hells Angels biker gang, reported El Pais. The Hells Angels saw dozens of members arrested last year in Spain over drug trafficking and other illegal activity. El Tiempo also reported a link between Roldan and Mexican cartels, but gave no further details. Roldan is now the subject of an extradition request from Holland and faces charges of murder, money laundering, theft, extortion and the disposal of dead bodies, reported the Associated Press. Over recent years, the Rastrojos have been the preeminent Latin American organized crime presence in Spain , and the capture of Roldan comes less than a year after an assassin network linked to the group was dismantled there. Reports of a working relationship between the Rastrojos and Sinaloa Cartel have also abounded in recent years, making a link to Mexican organized crime in the present case entirely feasible. However, with the Rastrojos now in disarray it is unclear if Roldan's reported link to the criminal group was ongoing or a remnant from the past. With the decline of the Rastrojos, there have been signs Colombia's most powerful group, the Urabenos, are muscling into Spain , which is an attractive base of operations as the principal entry point for Latin American drugs arriving in Europe. The European market has become increasingly popular with Colombian groups, as Mexican groups have gained a stranglehold on the flow of drugs into the United States. The European route is also attractive because it presents a lower risk of interdiction and extradition than the United States."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
"Mexico Crime Tactics Migrating to Honduras. The brutal criminal tactics associated with Mexico's cartels are becoming increasingly common in Honduras, suggesting a migration of criminal methods as well as operations. Macabre Mexican-style violence is now taking place in Honduras, former Forensic Medicine Director Amilcar Rodas, told El Heraldo. Hondurans are living in fear they could fall victims to ""any type of violent act,"" he said, and that perception is correct. Dismemberment, burning and public hangings are used to create collective hysteria, said a criminologist who wanted to remain anonymous. The criminologist highlighted the assassination of children and the elderly as a method used by criminals to instil fear in both their enemies and citizens. According to the criminologist the phenomenon was the result of the ""cockroach effect,"" also known as the ""balloon effect,"" as criminals have spread out from Mexico and into other countries to escape the attentions of law enforcement. The migration of criminal groups and activities has long been observed, with the likes of Mexican groups the Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel increasingly active in Central America in recent years, partly as a result of law enforcement efforts that have made it harder for these organizations to operate on their home turf. What is now being reported in Honduras suggests it's not just criminal operations that are migrating but also psychological tactics. The increasing brutality of Mexican criminal groups has proven effective at controlling civilian populations as well as the organizations' own ranks. It makes sense that criminal organizations in other countries might want to follow suit, especially in Honduras, where huge drug trafficking profits are at stake , and which is already the most murderous country in the world. The Mexican-style violence in Honduras may be the result of local organizations employing copycat tactics or it may simply be the result of Mexican groups' increasing activity in the country; the government stated earlier this year that the Zetas, the most violent of the Mexican cartels and one famed for its extreme brutality, now has an established presence in Honduras."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Recent Arms Seizures Underscore Risks of Venezuelas Political Tension. Three recent seizures of military-grade weapons in Venezuela provide evidence that such arms are circulating and in demand precisely as Venezuela is suffering a violent political crisis. The first seizure of military weapons and equipment occurred at the Arturo Michelena International Airport in Valencia, the capital city of Carabobo state on the Caribbean coast. Ender Palencia Ortiz, who is deputy minister of Prevention and Citizen Security as well a general in the country's national guard (Guardia Nacional Bolivariana - GNB), reported that authorities seized 90 BT-150 radio antennas, 19 rifles, and six telephones labeled with military acronyms. Palencia Ortiz added that the weapons arrived in Venezuela on February 3, and that they came from Miami, Florida. Although no arrests were reported, the deputy minister made assurances that investigators would ""find those responsible for financing terrorist groups that intend to undermine the peace of the Venezuelan people."" The second seizure occurred February 4 when the GNB detained one of its own sergeants, along with his wife and two daughters, ages four and seven, in the western state of Barinas. While the family was detained, the GNB seized seven light-weight automatic rifles that the sergeant allegedly intended to sell. Then on February 9, the GNB arrested two men at a checkpoint in Sucre state and seized four 7.62-caliber light-weight automatic rifles, 3,000 rounds, 24 magazines, 12 portable radios, and a cell phone. Additionally, in an unusual operation during the same week, the police's scientific investigations unit dismantled a ""laboratory"" for military-grade ammunition in Carabobo state. Two men were arrested. The police report stated that the ammunition ""was marketed and distributed to criminal gangs operating throughout the nation's territory."" These weapons captures come amid considerable political tension between the government of President Nicolas Maduro and its opposition. While Maduro has warned of imminent military intervention ""orchestrated"" by the United States, the opposition, led by National Assembly president Juan Guaido , is actively seeking the military's support. The unchecked circulation of illegal weapons has become widespread in Venezuela in recent years. In 2012, the Presidential Commission for Arms and Ammunition Control and Disarmament estimated that there were between 1.2 and 1.5 million unregistered weapons in the hands of civilians nationwide. Some studies have found a relationship between Venezuela's high homicide rate -- 81 per 100,000 inhabitants -- and the fact that 89 percent of homicides are committed with firearms. It is common for criminal gangs to possess grenades and weapons of war, often stolen from military barracks. Some Venezuelan security experts estimate that 85 percent of the bullets the gangs use come from the country's state-owned firearms manufacturer. And this information comes from an unpublished report conducted in 2015 by the government itself. But these weapons are not only in the hands of criminal groups. The governments of both late President Hugo Chavez and current President Nicolas Maduro have armed both the country's ""colectivos"" -- civilian paramilitary groups -- and ""milicias,"" groups of uniformed civilians who are receiving military training. Maduro appears to be preparing for an eventual conflict with the United States, ordering military exercises; sending 700 officers from the infamous Special Action Forces (Fuerzas de Acciones Especiales - FAES) to the border with Colombia; mobilizing the National Bolivarian Militia and relying on groups of armed civilians to keep him in power. And he has stated clearly that he will use his weapons against a supposed foreign invasion. Disarming the civilian population has been an ongoing challenge for the Venezuelan government. Neither the country's 2013 disarmament law nor the incentives promoted by the Maduro administration to strip criminal gangs of their arsenals have garnered results. Media investigations have already established the existence of a large black market for weapons in Venezuela. What's more, security officials often are the source of such weapons, selling them even via social networking applications. What is most concerning about the three recent seizures, which captured at least 30 rifles, is that this high-powered weaponry is clearly available at a time when Venezuela's long-simmering political tensions have reached a boiling point."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"US Easing of Gun Export Controls Could Send New Wave of Arms to LatAm. US President Donald Trump has proposed a new reform that would ease firearm export controls for US weapons manufacturers, which could increase the already high number of US-sourced firearms used in criminal activities in Latin America. The proposal , published May 14, would shift authority to regulate exports of certain firearms and related products from the State Department to the Commerce Department. The move aims to streamline the approval process for arms exports so US manufacturers -- suffering from decreased domestic sales in the Trump era -- can sell more guns, ammunition and accessories abroad. ""There will be more leeway to do arms sales,"" a senior administration official told Reuters last year when the plan was first floated unofficially. ""You could really turn the spigot on if you do it the right way."" The rule would apply to ""commercial items widely available in [US] retail outlets and less sensitive military items,"" the proposal states. That definition would cover products like assault-type rifles, military-grade sniper scopes, armor-piercing ammunition and most handguns. While many in Congress support the move, several powerful Senators have vowed to fight it. In a joint press release , the human rights organization Global Exchange and the Violence Policy Center, a pro-gun control group, slammed the proposal, saying it ""will likely lead to more US guns getting into the hands of criminal organizations, human rights abusers, terrorist groups, and others who wreak harm."" Indeed, US-sourced guns play a major role in fueling criminal violence in Latin America and the Caribbean. Data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) consistently shows that a large percentage of firearms seized in Central America and the Caribbean can be traced back to the United States. And a majority of murders in the world's most homicidal region involve the use of a gun. The new export rules are likely to affect many countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. But due to its proximity to the United States and other factors , Mexico is likely to see a significant impact. InSight Crime spoke with researcher and activist John Lindsay-Poland of Global Exchange about the flow of US firearms to Mexico, the role these firearms play in rising levels of violence and the potential effects that the proposed reform might have on these dynamics.* InSight Crime (IC): American guns have for years been flowing into Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. Can you give us some background on this and some context for the recent focus on this dynamic as of late? John Lindsay-Poland (JLP): It's true, US weapons have been flowing into Mexico and other countries both legally and illegally for many years. The end of the assault weapons ban in 2004 created even greater conditions to obtain firearms that are of a special interest to organized criminal groups in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. The structure of the US-Mexico border is such that most controls are on the south-to-north trafficking route, under the idea, in the United States, that the threat is in Mexico. I think that corresponds to an American exceptionalism idea that [the United States] cannot pose a threat. The infrastructure does not control very well for weapons that are going north to south. When the drug war in Mexico heated up, the market conditions were great both on the supply and demand side for an increased flow of military-grade weaponry. The drug war becomes helpful to the gun industry because the premise of the drug war is that the United States and its allies are going to fight drug trafficking through military and policing means, so therefore they're going to be armed. The collusion of these forces with organized crime is overlooked in the interest of that market. IC: Two of the US agencies primarily responsible for combating cross-border arms trafficking are the ATF and the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Have these agencies collaborated effectively or been given the proper resources to stem the flow of US firearms to Mexico? JLP: There's a US Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that says they were not collaborating effectively. I don't know this from my own fieldwork, but I would take the GAO's word for it. The ATF has been hobbled by congressional restrictions as a result of the gun industry's lobbying that has prevented it from having a permanent director for years, the resources and the legislation. The fact that international gun trafficking has not been a federal crime in itself is also an indicator of the lack of resources that the agency has. Because the US prioritizes commerce, the effort to try to stop physical things from going over the border is never going to be successful. There will be people who are caught and weapons that are seized, and that's a good thing, but any successful effort has to go further upstream to the production and marketing of weapons, as well as the policies and laws related to that, in order to stop the flow. IC: How effective have Mexican authorities been in stemming the flow of US weapons south to Mexico? JLP: Not effective. A 2013 study from the University of San Diego estimated that 250,000 firearms purchased in the United States are trafficked into Mexico each year. The number of firearms recovered at crime scenes has gone down in recent years. It's unclear exactly why, but the incentives within the Mexican police and armed forces are not strong enough to go after weapons. There are incentives to go after drugs, but there's also of course extensive collusion between police and military forces and organized crime, so that I think is also undermining efforts to recover weapons. Mexico can work with the United States to strengthen enforcement and market controls on the US side of the border. The other thing is that the approach to security and to drug trafficking in Mexico is supported by the United States, which is reinforcing a kind of arms race between criminal groups and the state. If criminal groups get more weaponry, police get more weaponry, and if police get more weaponry, criminal groups get more weaponry. IC: Do you think the flow of US firearms to Mexico is used to explain the high levels of violence we're seeing in Mexico as opposed to flawed security strategies or more structural issues? JLP: I would definitely affirm that the flow of US guns has contributed to homicides in Mexico. If you look, for example, at the percentage of homicides committed with firearms, it goes up. In the early 2000s, one in four homicides were committed with firearms. In the US context, people expect murders to be committed with guns because that's been a long-term trend within the United States. In Mexico that wasn't always the case. The gun-related homicides are going up and the reason they're able to go up is that there are more guns. That's not the only reason, but it is one. Since most of those guns are coming from the United States, illegally or legally, of course the United States has a role. IC: With growing support for stricter gun control in the United States, is there any chance we'll see a decrease in the number of US guns in route to Mexico? JLP: I think there is an opening now. The gun violence prevention movement in the United States has been very focused on crimes committed with guns in the United States, and generally has not been aware of how US-sourced guns are being used outside our borders. So that is an important piece of trying to have an impact in Mexico or in other countries. ""The approach to security and to drug trafficking in Mexico is supported by the United States, which is reinforcing a kind of arms race between criminal groups and the state."" That said, if there were a new assault weapons ban, it would have an impact in Mexico, even if the ban is done without the awareness of the impact in Mexico. When the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004, California retained an assault weapons ban. Mexican communities on the other side of the border from Texas, Arizona and New Mexico saw a much greater increase in gun deaths after the expiration of the federal assault weapons ban than Mexican communities on the other side of the border from California. There is interest now in Mexico in increased work around guns both within the country and bilaterally. I think there is increased interest in how to create more awareness that could lead to policy changes that would have an impact on the guns coming into Mexico. But there's a long way to go. IC: In a recent article you wrote for Al Jazeera , you argued that the United States should ""suspend gun export licenses to Mexico and reorient its security policy there."" Can you explain your reasoning? JLP: We call for a suspension of firearms licenses to Mexico because under the current system, there is no adequate end-use control mechanism for legally exported weapons to Mexico from the United States. When a gun producer goes to the US State Department to seek an export license, it has to name the end users. Now in Mexico, only the Mexican military is legally permitted to import firearms. And they're also the only legal distributor within Mexico, including to the police. All police weapons in Mexico come through the Mexican military, which produces them themselves, although this is a very small portion, or they import them. About two-thirds of the weapons that they have imported have gone outside Mexico City. However, when the license comes before the State Department, 80 percent of those applications, according to a State Department source who I spoke with, said that they name the end users as within Mexico City, the military or police within Mexico City, when we know that most are being distributed outside the capital to police forces around the country. The US State Department is not getting sufficient information about who the end users really are, which means that they cannot under the current system exclude police forces that have committed severe human rights abuses or colluded with organized crime from getting US-sourced firearms. It's important that the State Department suspends those licenses and creates a system with end-use controls that allows them to know where the end users are and who they are. IC: How will the Trump administration's proposal affect levels of violence in Mexico? JLP: We can expect even less oversight on end users of US guns, so more weapons going to police and military units that Washington knows are colluding with organized crime, have ""lost"" weapons, or have committed serious human rights abuses. That further erodes the rule of law and makes conflicts over territory and business even more violent. * This transcript was edited for clarity and length."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
"Venezuela Citizens Charged With Trafficking Arms From Miami. US prosecutors have indicted five citizens of Venezuela in connection with a case involving a Miami arms trafficking network that illustrates the Florida city's importance for gun runners sending US weapons abroad. Venezuelans Ender Enrique Soto Hernandez, Ender Alberto Soto Hernandez, Luis Antonio Urdaneta Pozo, Wilmer Onelis Hinestroza Pereira and Alcibiades de Jesus Palmar Narvaez have been charged with federal arms trafficking violations in the Southern District of Florida, according to a February 16 indictment. The five men stand accused of involvement in a scheme to illegally export weapons and ammunition to Venezuela since 2013. Their case intersects with charges previously brought against three other Venezuelan citizens. Jose Gutierrez Morales, Alfredo Montilla Hernandez and Abrahan Jose Aguilar Sanchez have all pleaded guilty in recent weeks to charges that they conspired to illegally ship arms from Miami to Venezuela. According to reports from El Nuevo Herald , Aguilar Sanchez's lawyer told the court that his client was going to cooperate with authorities after pleading guilty. It is likely that the information he provided helped lead to the new indictment of the five Venezuelans. Investigators allege that the five newly indicted defendants bought or stole at least 13 firearms, five rifles and 54 pounds of ammunition in Florida and carried them in their luggage or shipped them through parcel services from Miami to Maracaibo, Venezuela. An investigation of the trafficking ring began in April 2016 when Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers intercepted a package at Miami International Airport sent from Maracaibo by a man named Ender Soto. Upon inspection, the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) branch of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency found that the shipment contained 25 empty car battery boxes. The agency then tracked the package to Gutierrez Morales and Montilla Hernandez, according to the criminal complaint filed against the two men. In May, airport officials selected Aguilar Sanchez, who was arriving to Miami on a flight from Maracaibo, for questioning. Aguilar Sanchez's phone was reviewed during inspection and Soto's telephone number was found, linking him to the investigation against Gutierrez Morales and Montilla Hernandez, according to a separate criminal complaint. Then in June, according to court records, Aguilar Sanchez went to the Miami airport to pick up Gutierrez Morales, who had flown from Maracaibo to Miami. Gutierrez Morales listed Aguilar Sanchez's residence as where he was staying while in the United States, the complaint stated. Shortly thereafter, HSI began conducting surveillance on Gutierrez Morales and Montilla Hernandez, and at the property listed as the destination of the original April package containing the empty car batteries. Later in June, Gutierrez Morales was observed delivering two pallets containing two assault rifles and nearly 15,000 rounds of ammunition hidden inside electrical generators to Conavenca Freight Forwarders in Miami, according to the criminal complaint. The surveillance operation culminated months later in October when an HSI officer intercepted a white pickup truck at the Conavenca shipping company. Gutierrez Morales and Montilla Hernandez were observed earlier that day dropping handguns off at the property being surveilled prior to the truck leaving to Conavenca without them. Upon inspection, officers found the same empty car battery boxes from the April package in the truck's bed. The boxes were packed with eight handguns, approximately 23,500 rounds of ammunition and 19 high capacity magazines, according to court records. Gutierrez Morales and Montilla Hernandez were pulled over later that same day and arrested. In the car, officers found two handguns, five AR-15 assault rifles that had been taken apart, and more than 1,700 rounds of ammunition. According to court documents, the US Attorney's Office filed charges against Gutierrez Morales and Montilla Hernandez on December 1, 2016 for attempting to illegally export weapons and ammunitions to Venezuela. That same day, Aguilar Sanchez was intercepted at the Miami airport attempting to board a plane to Venezuela. Court records explain that after further interrogation, HSI officers found photographs on Aguilar Sanchez's cellphone of electrical generators that matched the description of those used in the June shipment. He was also subsequently charged with arms trafficking violations. All three men originally pleaded innocent before entering guilty pleas. The US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida did not immediately respond to a request for comment by InSight Crime regarding the whereabouts of the five newly-indicted defendants. The expanding case against the trafficking ring highlights how a variety of local conditions have contributed to Miami's status as a major hub in the international illegal arms trade. One key attraction Miami holds for gun runners is the large amount of legitimate shipping commerce that transits the city's port, which is one of the busiest in the United States. The large volume of goods makes it relatively easy for smugglers to hide contraband among legitimate merchandise without detection. This is particularly true for shipments heading to Latin American countries. According to a recent report ( pdf ), Miami acts as a leading entry point into Central and South America, handling ""half of the eight million tons of cargo coming from or going to Latin America each year."" Another factor that makes Miami an attractive hub for arms trafficking is the availability of high-quality weapons in the city, aided in part by lax local regulations on gun sales. According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence's 2016 Gun Law State Scorecard , Florida received an ""F"" grade for its gun laws. The report also noted that the state ""did not enact any significant firearms-related laws in 2016."" The recent case in Miami also illustrates the high demand for firearms in Venezuela. According to research from Gun Policy, an international firearms observatory, there are estimated to be as many as 2.7 million illicit firearms in Venezuela. Only Brazil -- a global hub for firearms production -- has a higher estimated number of illicit firearms in South America. The demand for guns in Venezuela is likely related to the country's ongoing economic and political turmoil, which has fueled high levels of violence in recent years. Although accurate statistics are difficult to obtain, Venezuela's homicide rate last year of approximately 59 per 100,000 citizens ranks it as Latin America's second deadliest country behind El Salvador. It remains unclear to whom and for what purpose the guns were being trafficked from Miami to Venezuela in the above-mentioned case. But it is not unlikely that they may have been destined for use in criminal activities. As the case unfolds, it is possible that other defendants will reveal further details that will enhance authorities' understanding of the dynamics of illicit arms flows from Florida to Venezuela."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Stolen Guns Fuel El Salvador Black Market for Arms. More than four guns were stolen every day in El Salvador over the last six years, according to a new report that highlights one of the sources of black market weapons in the violence-wracked country. Between 2010 and October 2016 in El Salvador, 11,229 guns were reported stolen, reported La Prensa Grafica. Of these, 22 percent were high caliber weapons including machine guns, rifles and shotguns, some of which were stolen from military facilities. At the same time, there has been a significant decline in the number of guns stolen per year over this period. While in 2010 there were 2,463 weapons reported stolen, representing 6.8 a day, in 2015 there were just 914 weapons reported stolen, or about 2.5 per day. According to research body the Gun Policy Institute , there are 344,587 registered guns in El Salvador and an estimated 128,000 to 280,000 illegal arms. There are several sources of these illegal weapons , including the trading of former civil war arms and arms trafficked illegally into the country from the United States. And, as these new figures show, stolen weapons also account for a significant percentage. Another major source of black market guns -- one that is likely connected to the arms robberies -- is corrupt members of the security forces. Investigations have revealed how police officers, members of the military and other officials, some of them high-level operators, have been involved in stealing weapons from security force stocks and selling them on the black market. One notable aspect of the figures is the drop in the number of weapons being stolen over the past several years, which came against a backdrop of a substantial increase in legal gun ownership in El Salvador, according to the Gun Policy Institute. These trends were accompanied by reports that street gangs were increasingly seeking out and obtaining illegal weapons. In addition, there are signs the gangs are sourcing ever more sophisticated weaponry, with recent media reports highlighting their growing use of assault rifles. While it is impossible to say with any certainty what lies behind this drop, it has not coincided with any notable drop in violence and appears to contradict the reported increase in arms possessed by gangs. Assuming organized crime represents a significant share of illegal gun purchases, this could indicate that gangs and other criminal organizations may be finding it easier to source weapons from elsewhere.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"80% of Homicides in Honduras Result of Gun Violence: Report. Firearms are reportedly used in more than 80 percent of all homicides in Honduras, almost double the global average, an epidemic fueled in large part by the ease with which criminals can obtain weapons and ammunition. Of the 48,094 murders registered in Honduras between 2008 and 2015, 39,111 were committed using a firearm, according to data from the Violence Observatory at the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH) accessed by La Tribuna. At 81.3 percent, the ratio of gun deaths to overall homicides in Honduras is almost twice the worldwide average of approximately 41 percent ( pdf ), according to the Igarape Institute. Honduras was at one time the most violent peacetime nation in the world and remains among the most homicidal. Murder rates peaked at over 90 per 100,000 residents in the early 2010s before falling to their current levels of around 57 per 100,000. The northern department of Cortes -- home to San Pedro Sula -- saw the most violence during the recent eight-year stretch, according to the Observatory, registering 31 percent of the murders nationwide. Tegucigalpa's Francisco Morazan and La Ceiba's Atlantida were the second and third most violent departments, accounting for 17 and 8 percent of the total homicides, respectively. The high rate of gun deaths is closely linked to the large black market for weapons that is supplying Honduras' powerful criminal groups. In 2014, a Honduran congressional commission estimated that over 1 million weapons were in circulation, and that more than 700,000 of those were unlicensed. Many of the illegal firearms are trafficked from the United States and from neighboring countries such as El Salvador or Guatemala. Still more are sourced from Honduras' own security forces, which do not register their weapons with the state, according to an anonymous source consulted by La Tribuna. This lack of regulation facilitates the movement of weapons from police and military stockpiles into the hands of criminal groups. Ammunition also appears to be inexpensive and in abundant supply. The head of the Violence Observatory, Migdonia Ayestas, noted with alarm that up to 400 bullet casings have been found at some crime scenes, and that bodies are found riddled with as many as 10 bullet wounds. This shows ""that the bullets or projectiles would appear to be so cheap that they don't care about using as many as it takes to demonstrate their lethal power,"" Ayestas told La Tribuna. To be sure, gun violence is a serious problem across the region. In Central America, firearms are used in 73 percent of all homicides, according to Igarape, while in South America that number is 53 percent."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Venezuela Criminal Arsenals Widen to Include Grenades. Venezuela has seen the highest number of deaths and injuries from grenades in Latin America over the past three years, with corruption in the military making soldiers both a cause and target of this trend. The year 2015 was a record year for Venezuela in many aspects. In terms of citizen security, the country witnessed the highest homicide rates since its independence. The Venezuelan Violence Observatory (Observatorio Venezolano de la Violencia - OVV) recorded 27,875 victims, pushing the homicide rate to 90 murders for every 100,000 inhabitants and giving the country the second highest rate in the world after El Salvador for countries not at war. Within this total there were at least 47 deaths attributed to the detonation of grenades. The United Nations Regional Center for Peace, Disarmament and Development ( UNLIREC ) reported that hand grenade deaths increased by 194 percent during 2015 compared to the two previous years. Comparative figures are not available for the region, but Venezuela very likely maintains its position as the South American nation with the most grenade deaths, given that it held that distinction in 2014 with only 13 cases reported ( pdf ). The increase in grenade deaths has attracted the attention of the general public and international organizations. In looking for an explanation, Venezuelan officials have blamed corrupt military personnel for providing hardware from their arsenals to criminal gangs. This leakage of military weapons is not limited to grenades, but also rifles, ammunitions and mortar shells and as a result, the firepower of criminal gangs is increasing. Venezuela saw 84 cases involving the use of hand grenades in 2015, an average of 7 cases per month. And the trend seemed to accelerate over the course of the year, with the last six months registering an average of 9.6 cases. Grenade explosions resulted in 110 people being wounded; the highest count to date in Venezuela. The data does not account for people who may have died later from their grenade wounds. Press and other reports from the first quarter of 2016 indicate that the pattern is likely to hold this year. In an April 6 case, a grenade that detonated in a detention center in the northern state of Sucre killed six prisoners. On May 20, 25-year-old Sandra Zuelma Silva died after a mortar grenade detonated inside her house in the indigenous community of Nueva Esperanza, Apure state, on the Colombian border. National Guards reported finding two undetonated hand grenades at the scene. (See photo below) Authorities have not reported or have not been able to ascertain where the explosives came from. Police Superintendent Luis Godoy noted that it is very difficult to determine the origin of a grenade after it has exploded. At best, one might determine the brand, or even the batch the weapon belonged to and track down whether it was assigned to a particular military unit. UNLIREC's William Godnick has said that it is more likely the grenades used by criminals were sold on the black market by members of Venezuela's Armed Forces rather than brought into the country as contraband. Venezuelan officials, on the other hand, point to Colombia as a likely source. Anthony Daquin, a former security advisor to the president, and retired Maj. Gen. Edgar Bolivar, who served as chief of operations for the National Guard, said some of the grenades are probably smuggled to Venezuelan criminal groups by Colombian guerrillas. The Venezuelan regime is currently accompanying both of Colombia's main guerrilla groups in the peace talks with the Colombian government. Venezuela's security forces did little about the increasing reports of grenade use until criminals began using them to target police officers and soldiers, and even barracks and police stations. A series of five such cases occurred over a two day period in September 2015. In one particular attack, two grenades were thrown at police at a pedestrian checkpoint in Baruta, a municipality that is part of Caracas metropolitan area. Eight agents were wounded by shrapnel, and one was left in a coma. Some officials have characterized the attacks on security forces as a backlash against the government's ongoing crackdown on criminal gangs, known as Operation Liberation and Protection of the People (Operacion Liberacion y Proteccion del Pueblo - OLP), but two of the targets of these attacks had no discernable connection to OLP. A confidential report by the Terrorism Investigation Division of Venezuela's investigative police, the CICPC, noted that the grenades used in these attacks were similar in make and model to those supplied to the military and the National Guard. The document also confirmed that during military exercises ""these explosive artefacts are supplied in an irregular fashion and are subsequently sold on the black market."" Security expert Daquin warned that the increase in national military exercises during the past few months could result in more military explosives in the hands of civilians. The training and preparedness operations entail major military deployments and widespread engagement with the civilian population. ""What better moment to distribute these types of weapons than with the so-called exercises,"" Daquin said. Sandra Zuelma was killed by a mortar explosion in her rural community the same day the nationwide Independence II 2016 military exercise commenced. The operation was followed by joint exercises known as Patria Chavista. Those exercises are based on a scenario of popular resistance supported by regular forces. In both activities, military equipment is entrusted to community defense councils. The military conducts periodic campaigns exhorting personnel to carefully guard and account for their arsenals. However, the grenade attacks on police prompted the commander of the National Guard, Gen. Nestor Reverol, to recently acknowledge in an internal document that ""there has been loss of armament, optical and optoelectronic devices, accessories and ammunition of different calibers, which indicates the complicity of some forces with unscrupulous people."" There is reason to believe that criminals now have even more firepower than just guns and grenades. In February 2016, a shootout with police ended with the authorities recovering an AT4 anti-tank bazooka from inside a stolen Land Cruiser (see photo above). With military complicity suspected in black market arms deals, police are left wondering how long they have before their own stations come under high-powered attack."	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
El Salvador Military Official Sold Weapons to Gangs. An officer in El Salvador's army has been arrested for selling firearms to an alleged gang member, highlighting how the country's military is fueling a widespread illegal market for weapons. On October 17, police arrested Mario Alfredo Cristales Alvarado, a high-ranking officer in El Salvador's Special Brigade of Military Security. The officer had just left his post prior to his arrest, and was carrying a rifle and ammunition with him at the time, reported La Prensa Grafica. Alvarado is accused of selling weapons, including an M-16, six magazines, and 210 bullet cartridges, to a gang member via a middleman, reported La Pagina. Alvarado's attempt to sell military weaponry to gang members is representative of how corrupt factions of the military remain involved in arms trafficking, thus fueling El Salvador's recent record-breaking levels of violence. There have been multiple cases of Salvadoran military officials selling firearms, ammunition, and military gear on the black market. These weapons often end up into the hands of members of El Salvador's gangs, as well as international criminal organizations. Nevertheless, successful prosecutions and convictions of military officials for arms trafficking remain rare. One prominent 2014 case ended with military officials being sentenced to community service, after they were accused of stealing grenades from military stockpiles. SEE MORE: Coverage of Arms Trafficking The ongoing availability of firearms has helped to drive up homicides across El Salvador. Police officials reported 907 homicides during August 2015, surpassing levels of violence seen during El Salvador's civil war, which ended in 1992. Notably, according to testimonials by members of Mara Salvatrucha ( MS13 ) and the Barrio 18 Revolutionaries in El Salvador, the gangs say they have more access than ever to firearms, especially assault rifles. This pattern of military involvement in weapons sales to criminal organizations is not limited to El Salvador. Similar cases have been reported in Peru , Colombia , Uruguay , and other countries throughout Latin America.	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
"El Salvador Gangs Involved in Arms Trafficking Network. El Salvador's street gangs were reportedly involved in a criminal network that trafficked weapons into the country, a worrying sign of increased sophistication on the gangs' part. Authorities in El Salvador detained 90 people accused of participating in a criminal network that sold illegal weapons sourced from Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Among those arrested were at least 21 alleged members of street gang the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13), ElSalvador.com reported. A key coordinator of the network was an imprisoned MS13 leader, Medardo Arana Castro, alias ""Pilot,"" reported La Prensa Grafica. Other important players include two Nicaraguan brothers, Aaron Noel and Darwin Jose Ponce Alvarado, who are accused of smuggling the weapons from other Central American countries into El Salvador. Additionally, arms traffickers based within El Salvador were involved in buying, storing, and selling the weapons, along with 16 factions or ""clicas"" of the MS13, according to La Prensa Grafica. The probe into the arms trafficking ring also allowed investigators to collect evidence related to other crimes, including several extortion and homicide cases. Two murders involved security guards who likely interfered in the MS13's extortion activities, the report said. Within El Salvador, the gun traffickers charged as much as $600 for pistols, $1,200 for assault rifles and $600 for grenades, La Prensa Grafica reported. Weapons are obviously a vital part to the MS13's modus operandi, but there are few legal cases that shed light on how, exactly, the gangs source their weapons. That being said, El Salvador has a long-running problem of arms disappearing from official military stockpiles , alongside reports that street gangs are bearing military-grade weaponry. If several MS13 members were indeed in touch with arms traffickers who moved weapons from other Northern Triangle countries into El Salvador, that is arguably a more sophisticated way of obtaining weapons than buying off local, corrupt security officials. Still, this appears to be a case in which the MS13 were primarily involved in buying and distributing guns within El Salvador, rather than coordinating the transnational sale of weapons themselves."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Mexico Seized Enough Illegal Weapons to Arm Navy, Police. The number of firearms seized from criminal groups over the past ten years -- an average of 40 a day -- could equip a force equivalent to Mexico's Navy and Federal Police put together; while the amount of seized cartridges would allow each weapon to fire at least 105 rounds. Over the past decade, the Army has seized almost 13,000 grenades and 150,000 firearms, including assault weapons meant for use in warfare. This is despite the fact that conventional arms sales are illegal in Mexico, and -- at least on paper -- the country has been living in times of ""peace"" for at least half a century. The seizures were part of the Army's permanent campaign against organized crime, and while there have been cases of large arsenals discovered in warehouses or secret hideouts, many weapons have also been taken from cars, people, or violent crime scenes. This article was originally published by Animal Politico and was translated and reprinted with permission. See Spanish original here. Last December, a United Nations and World Health Organization (WHO) report on violence prevention revealed that in Mexico -- contrary to the most conservative estimates -- seven out of 10 people are killed with firearms. This put Mexico in the 12th spot worldwide, among countries with the greatest proportion of these kinds of homicides, at the same level as Kuwait and Brazil. Information on weapons seizures kept by Mexico's Secretary of National Defense (SEDENA) also shows that criminal firepower is increasing -- the percentage of larger weapons seized by authorities is rising compared to smaller weapons, like pistols. This increase in criminal firepower can also be seen in the number of grenades seized from criminal groups, which increased by more than 1,400 percent over a decade. However, the numbers from 2014 show a significant decrease in these seizures compared to previous years. Mexico's Underworld has an Army In little more than a decade -- from January 2005 to February 2015 -- the Mexican army seized 147,041 firearms that were either in the hands of organized crime or civilians not permitted to own them, meaning an average of 40 weapons are seized every 24 hours. To put this in perspective, these weapons could equip an ""army"" that outnumbers all the troops in Mexico's Navy (approximately 60,000 marines) or the Federal Police (approximately 45,000 officers). In total, the number of weapons seized from organized crime would arm about 60 percent of the operational forces in the Mexican Army. Statistics on annual arm seizures saw a steady increase over this time, finally peaking in 2011. That year, the Army seized almost 32,500 weapons from criminal groups, 10,000 more weapons than the amount seized between 2005 to 2008. In total, the number of weapons seized from organized crime would arm about 60 percent of the operational forces in the Mexican Army. In 2012 -- the last year of President Felipe Calderon's term -- weapon seizures began to steadily decrease, until they reached levels similar to those seen in 2007. But the apparent strength of Mexico's criminal groups is not decreasing. The proportion of seized handguns and rifles was relatively stable until 2008. However, this changed in the following years, even as the total number of seized weapons has gone down. According to data from SEDENA, over the last five years more than 60 percent of seizures have consisted of large weapons, including shotguns, rifles, automatic and semi-automatic weapons, sniper rifles, machine guns, and grenade launchers, among others. There are cases in which the armed forces have had a significant impact. For example, on November 7, 2008, elements of the Mexican Army raided a warehouse in Reynosa, Tamaulipas that belonged to the Gulf Cartel, where they discovered 278 large arms, 126 short arms, over half a million bullet cartridges, and almost 300 grenades. Discovering the arsenals is not always easy. For example, on July 3, 2011, soldiers confiscated 171 firearms and almost 100,000 cartridges from the Zetas, who had hidden them in an underground storehouse. The weapons were buried on a piece of land in Las Salinas, Coahuila, where there otherwise appeared to be nothing there. If there hadn't been an anonymous tips, no one would have ever looked. But beyond these large operations, the majority of firearms have been discovered during daily, small-scale actions, like arrests or vehicle inspections. Weapons seizures are also common after street shootouts like those that occur in Tamaulipas. A Lot of Ammo and Grenades ""If we had any ammunition, you would not be here."" So said General Anaya said to General Twiggs, during the Mexican-America war of the 19th century. This is something that appears to weigh heavily in the minds of Mexico's criminals. According to official statistics, over the last decade Mexican authorities seized almost 15.8 million munitions, from small .22 caliber bullets to 7.62 caliber rounds used by the so-called ""Goat Horns"" (AK-47s) or .50 caliber bullets for anti-material Barrett rifles. Leaving the calibers aside -- and without counting the number of bullet clips found -- Mexico has seized enough ammunition for each seized weapon to fire an average of at least 105 rounds. The number of seized grenades also points to the increased firepower of criminal gangs. Available data shows that between 2006 to 2014, Mexico seized 12,857 explosives -- the equivalent of about three a day. Available data shows that between 2006 to 2014, Mexico seized 12,857 explosives -- the equivalent of about three a day. As occurred with firearms, grenade seizures increased year-on-year until reaching almost 3,000 in 2011. From then on seizures began to decrease, and have continued to do so during the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto. Criminals have had few qualms about using these explosive devices on various targets -- including civilians attending Independence Day ceremonies in Morelia in 2008 , to a military convoy in Guachinango, Jalisco last year, and in 2015, when they were used against a TV station in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. 'Goat Horns' From China Selling high-caliber weapons in Mexico is prohibited. However, this hasn't been an obstacle for the traffic and sale of high-powered firearms on the black market, as evidenced by the types of weapons seized. According to data from a special unit in the Attorney General's Office that investigates arms trafficking, 60 percent of seized large weapons correspond to 7.62x39 millimeter cartridges. These are weapons that use long and highly lethal bullets -- those used in AK-47 rifles, known as ""goat horns"" for their shape. The AK-47 is not the only war weapon seized from criminals in Mexico. While the AK-47 is of Russian origin, there are 14 countries that produce similar models or copies of this gun, according to a report by non-governmental organization Control Arms. Some of these foreign models have been found in Mexico. For example, according to SEDENA data from 2011, one of every six ""goat horns"" is a NORINCO brand, a Chinese company that markets weapons technology internationally, and that has been accused of, among other things, selling missiles to countries like North Korea and Iran. The ""Chinese AK-47"" offers the same benefits as its Russian cousin, but at a lower price, as this model lacks chrome plating in the barrel and gas piston. The AK-47 is not the only war weapon seized from criminals in Mexico. To cite two more examples, included among seizures are M-16 assault rifles used by the US Army in conflicts like the Vietnam War, or the Mossberg 500 caliber shotgun used in operations like Desert Storm in Iraq. Investigations into the origins of the weaponry, with the support of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), has determined that 75 percent of seized weapons that have been traced come from gun stores in the United States and are trafficked across the northern border of Mexico. * This article originally appeared in Animal Politico and was translated and reproduced with permission.

Uruguay Police Smuggled Weapons to Brazil. Uruguay authorities are investigating police accused of trafficking some 300 weapons to Brazil, an indication that the most heavily armed country in South America -- in terms of per capita gun ownership -- may also serve as a valuable source of weaponry for criminal groups. On April 14, authorities detained three police officers and a businessman in the Uruguay-Brazil border city of Rivera as result of the investigation, reported Uruguayan newspaper El Pais. The detainees are suspected of trafficking 9-millimeter handguns and other semiautomatic pistols to the Brazilian cities of Porto Alegre and Pelotas between 2013 to 2015. Brazilian criminal group the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) is one suspected recipient of the weapons, according to El Pais. Only a single road separates Rivera from its sister city in Brazil, Santana do Livramento, which facilitates smuggling. Brazilian police have previously identified Rivera as one of the two major entry points for weapons moved from Uruguay into Brazil -- the other is the city of Artigas, also on the Uruguay-Brazil frontier. As documented in a 2009 report by research institute Small Arms Survey , Uruguay has the highest per capita gun ownership in South America, with one firearm for every three residents. According to El Observador , there are 87 guns for every 100,000 people in Uruguay's Rivera department, with 54 guns for every 100,000 people in the department of Artigas. This proliferation of firearms has likely fed an illegal weapons trade with Brazil, although there have been few notable prosecutions against arms trafficking in Uruguay. One high-profile case also involved police in the department of Treinta y Tres (where there are 116 guns for every 100,000 residents). The investigation found that over 200 weapons were missing from the police department, suspected of being sold on the black market. That case eventually stalled in court , partly due to Uruguay's weak gun trafficking laws. Congress did approve new gun trafficking legislation last year , which prohibits carrying weapons and munitions without a license, and create new regulations for weapon purchases. However, the law is not yet active.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Arms Theft from Peru Army Supplies Points to Official Complicity. Authorities in Peru say the majority of arms used by criminal groups are stolen from private owners and security forces, highlighting a common regional phenomenon that is often facilitated by corrupt officials. Specialists consulted by El Comercio said the majority of pistols and shotguns used by criminal groups in Peru were stolen from legitimate owners, rather than acquired through the black market. Authorities reported that 1,767 firearms were declared lost or stolen in 2013 alone. Former Interior Minister Remigio Hernani told the newspaper the majority of the weapons stolen by criminals had been legally imported, sold and licensed, and that common targets for theft were private owners, gun shops and caches maintained by the National Police (PNP) and army. In a recent operation , authorities recovered firearms, ammunition, explosives, military equipment and uniforms from alleged land thieves. Police believe the majority of the weapons were stolen. Anthropologist Jaris Mujica, meanwhile, has reported that criminals in Peru often purchase weapons at formal sales points, and that an influx of cheap arms on the legal market has led to increasing ownership of firearms in the country. Although El Comercio provides few details about how criminals steal these weapons, the fact many are taken from security force stockpiles gives reason to believe there is collaboration from corrupt officials. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Arms Trafficking Peru has a history of illegal arms trafficking by officials. Peruvian soldiers were arrested in 2009 for allegedly providing weaponry to Colombia's FARC rebel group , and one official claimed in 2011 the practice was still occurring. Former intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos also organized a scheme in 1999 in which 10,000 assault rifles from Jordan were sold to the FARC. Arms acquisition by criminals and illegal groups facilitated by official corruption is common in Latin America. Mexican cartels have been known to both steal and purchase supplies from the Guatemalan and Honduran armies, while the Uruguayan police and the Argentine army are believed to have sold hundreds of firearms to Brazilian criminals. In March this year, members of the Colombian army were accused of issuing the Urabenos narco-paramilitary group weaponry stolen from military stockpiles. While there have been calls for regional action to stop this phenomenon , the continued ""disappearance"" of large quantities of weapons raises the question of whether it is poor security measures or higher-level corruption that is more to blame."	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
Half of Weapons Missing from Cali Armoury as Count Gets Underway. An arms inspection at a military barracks in Cali, Colombia, has found 500 weapons missing out of 1,000 counted, with another 15,000 still to be checked, as a major investigation into weapons trafficking between security forces and criminal groups begins. The inventory check at the barracks of the Colombian Army's Third Brigade, where weapons recovered by security forces in the country's third-largest city are stored, is being carried out by the country's Prosecutor General's Office. There are fears that thousands of weapons could be unaccounted for. The majority of the missing weapons -- among them 44 rifles -- are believed to have gone back into circulation among criminal groups, reported Semana. The investigation began following the capture of a woman in August 2013 who had seven pistols in her possession, said the magazine. When a scandal erupted in October over the disappearance of arms from the Third Brigade, garrison commander General Luis Fernando Rojas announced the investigation would be carried out by the Prosecutor General's Office to guarantee transparency. In mid-December, the investigation led to the arrest of four people -- including one retired and two serving military officials. The sale of weapons by corrupt security force members is a common feature of arms trafficking. In recent years, examples of both theft from security service storage facilities and security personnel involvement have been noted throughout the region, including in Uruguay , Bolivia and El Salvador. InSight Crime investigators have witnessed first-hand the sale of weapons to rebel groups by security forces on two separate occasions in Colombia. Cali appears to be something of an arms trafficking hotspot, with reports of arms from China flowing into the city via the nearby port of Buenaventura noted in recent years. In 2009, more than 4,000 firearms were recovered in the city and almost 2,000 more in the surrounding municipalities. While the city's criminal groups are undoubtedly responsible for much of this, rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) maintain a significant presence in the surrounding rural area. The flow of weapons in Cali has aided a conflict among criminals which has seen the city become the most violent in Colombia , although this may change following a pact among the city's warring criminal groups. The murder rate fell significantly during the last two months of the year, with December murders dropping to a ten-year low, reported El Pais.	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
"El Chapo Guzman Tried to Buy Surface-to-Air Missiles. Members of ""El Chapo"" Guzman's Sinaloa Cartel tried to buy high-powered weaponry, including surface-to-air missiles and anti-tank weapons, according to US government reports, suggesting that the powerful drug trafficking syndicate is seeking to make a quantum leap in its military capacity. According to the US Justice Department, the Sinaloa Cartel, the Zetas and the Familia Michoacana all established arms trafficking networks that allowed them to import high caliber assault weapons and military equipment from the United States, reported Mexico's El Universal. In three of the 25 cases detailed, which span from 2007 to 2012, undercover agents with the US Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco (ATF) bureau managed to prevent Sinaloa Cartel operatives from obtaining weapons including Stinger surface-to-air missiles and various anti-tank weapons. Over the time period, US security forces broke up several arms trafficking cells, arresting a number of men on both sides of the border. Among the US arrests were ex-military personnel. The various trafficking cells operated out of Texas, Florida, Arizona, New Mexico and California. One of the reasons El Chapo has managed to evade capture for so long is thanks to his small army of private security, which in 2009 consisted of 300 personal bodyguards, according to a US diplomatic cable obtained by Wikileaks. With El Chapo believed to favor isolated hideouts , the type of high-powered weaponry mentioned in the reports would help repel security forces raids before they even came within touching distance of the infamous drug lord, while surface to air missiles would offer protection against raids carried out with helicopters. The reports also highlight what is a broader and ongoing issue -- the trafficking of arms from the United States to Mexico. The price and accessibility of arms in the United States makes it an ideal source country, not only for Mexico, but also for other crime-plagued Latin American countries, including Colombia, where there have been numerous cases showing how US-purchased weapons end up in the hands of Colombian gangs and drug trafficking organizations."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Mexico to Ask US Senate to Create Gun Registry in Border States. Mexico's Congress voted to formally ask the United States Senate to create a registry of all commercialized firearms in the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Although the motion will have little impact in the US, it shows the gun control issue continues to resonate on both sides of the border. The measure was approved January 9 by Mexico 's Permanent Commission, the government body that meets when the Senate and the lower house of Congress, the Chamber of Deputies, is in recess. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) senator who introduced the proposal said it was intended to make it easier to trace guns used in violent attacks, reports Mexican newspaper Informador. Close to 60,000 people were killed during the six-year presidency of Felipe Calderon, who left office in December. The US Southwest is a significant source of weaponry for Mexico's criminal organizations, who typically purchase firearms from US gun stores via a middleman or ""straw buyer."" In one indication of the reach of these arms trafficking networks, a semi-automatic pistol recently found at the scene of one shootout in Mexico has been traced back to a former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agent, as Minneapolis newspaper the Star Tribune reports. The semi-automatic was found at the scene of the shootout that killed a Mexican beauty queen. The gun was traced back to an ATF agent who worked in Arizona and played a prominent role in the so-called ""Fast and Furious"" scandal , which charged the ATF had willingly allowed weapons to ""walk"" across the border in an attempt to prosecute the main purchasers of the guns in Mexico. The scheme failed to reach the high level targets, and some of the weapons were later used in attacks on US law enforcement prompting a congressional investigation and hearings. The ATF agent apparently sold the weapon online for $1,100 to a US citizen in Arizona. The vote will likely prove to be a symbolic one. Gun laws in the US Southwest vary, with stricter controls enforced in California, compared to Arizona and Texas. It is unlikely that the US Senate will begin to pressure these areas to enforce more stringent controls anytime soon, although President Barack Obama has said that he is contemplating presidential decrees that would make it more difficult to obtain assault weapons nationwide. This threat follows the shooting deaths of 27 people , most of them children, in a Newtown, Connecticut school. The US is not the only illicit source of weaponry in Mexico. Guns stolen or illegally sold by the Mexican military, the owner of the only legal gun store in the country, are also thought to provide criminal groups with firepower. Some soldiers and police in Central America also illegally supply weapons to organized criminal groups throughout the region. Still, the US is by far the largest supplier of weapons to Mexican criminal organizations, according to numerous ATF agents interviewed by InSight Crime."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Firearm Homicides in Latin America Exceed Global Average: Report. According to a recent report by European research project Small Arms Survey, 21 out of 23 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean exceed the global average for the number of homicides committed with firearms. The report, released on August 27, shows that firearms homicides in Latin America and the Caribbean are far higher than the global average of 42 percent. Firearms were found to be used in 60 percent of homicides in South America, 61 percent in the Caribbean, and 70 percent in Central America. The survey also reveals that countries with the highest homicide rates had more murders committed with guns. In Latin America, this relationship is most visible in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, and Venezuela -- all of which have over 30 murders committed for every 100,000 inhabitants. The proportion of firearm homicides is over 70 percent in these countries, all of which have murder rates that have been increasing since 1995. Cuba and Suriname are the only countries in the region with proportions of firearm homicides below the global average. The alarming number of firearms homicides in Latin America, which in the United Nations' terms is reaching ""epidemic levels,"" has caused concern over availability of both legal and illegal weapons in the region. The widespread availability of firearms is one of the most frequently cited reasons for the rise in violence in Venezuela, one of the worst afflicted countries. The 2011 Small Arms Survey estimated that there were between 1.6 and 4.1 million civilian firearms in Venezuela last year. Venezuela has tried to tackle the problem by implementing disarmament campaigns and enacting stricter laws on firearms purchases and possession. On June 1, a law went into effect that bans the commercial sale of firearms and ammunition to civilians, following an amnesty period in which citizens could turn in both registered and unregistered weapons to the government without penalty."	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
Accused US Ammo Trafficker Gets Reduced Charges. A Mexico judge has reduced the charges against an American trucker accused of smuggling a truck full of rifle ammunition across the border, accepting his claim that he only crossed into the country by accident. Mexican border officials arrested Jabin Bogan in Ciudad Juarez this April with 268,000 rounds of ammunition in his vehicle. Bogan said he made a wrong turn and accidentally crossed into Mexico. One of his attorneys said a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer instructed him to continue driving into Mexico, but an official from that agency said none of their officers spoke with Bogan that day, the Associated Press reported. An initial press release by Mexican prosecutors said the ammunition was hidden under the truck's floorboards, but two customs agents and Bogan's lawyer say it was readily visible. Bogan's previous charges of ammunition smuggling could have landed him in prison for 35 years. He is currently being detained in a Veracruz maximum security prison. The appeals judge's decision to lessen the charge to possession of ammunition means Bogan could serve his sentence by performing community service or paying a fine. Ammunition trafficking into Mexico has increased in recent years. Where under a thousand bullets were seized by US authorities along the Arizona-Mexico border in 2007, the number jumped to 95,000 in 2011. That state, along with Texas, where Bogan crossed, is a major ammunition supplier, due to lax regulations on mass gun and bullet purchases. US law enforcement has few options to combat the illicit flow of guns and ammunition. Attempts to prosecute even the largest of arms salespeople who violate gun laws have been thrown out of court or are simply not prosecuted. A controversial program started in August 2011, which required gun dealers to report sales of multiple rifles of a certain type yielded sale reports for 7,300 rifles -- most of them from Texas -- according to a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) press release. Given the intense opposition in the US to programs like this, the ATF has been effectively neutered in its attempts to stop to Mexico-bound illicit arms and munitions.	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
"Most Guns in Mexico Traced to US Dealers: Govt Data. In a finding that will do little to slow the debate about the origin of weapons used by Mexico's bloody drug cartels, Justice Department data shows that close to 70 percent of firearms recovered in Mexico over the last five years can be traced back to the US. Of 99,000 trace requests submitted by Mexican authorities over the past five years for firearms suspected of being used in crimes, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) traced 68,000 to US manufacturers or importers, according to data published on its website , However, ATF Special Agent John Hageman cautioned the data could not be seen as definitive proof that 70 percent of the weapons used by Mexican organized criminals come from the US. In 2009, Mexico's military possessed 305,424 confiscated guns , and as, the ATF noted, the numbers provided Thursday represented only those trace requests voluntarily submitted to the bureau by authorities in Mexico. What's more, around 30 percent of trace data left the firearms' source country undetermined. The data does show that Mexico's criminals appear to be favoring more powerful weapons. Compared to 2007, when rifles accounted for some 28 percent of guns submitted by Mexico to the ATF for tracing, 2010 and 2011 saw figures of 59 and 43, respectively. Hageman said the ATF had not broken the data down beyond the categorization of rifles, pistols, revolvers, shotguns, and ""other,"" and cautioned that the designation of a rifle did not necessarily refer to an assault weapon. Nonetheless, the ATF's press release noted that Mexican authorities had reported a rise in the use of AK and AR-style assault rifles by organized criminal groups. The trend of increasing rifle recoveries points to a militarization of violent crime in Mexico, as traffickers eschew pistols and revolvers in favor of more powerful weapons. The escalation in violence has left over 50,000 dead in Mexico during the time span the ATF data covers. Tracing the flow of US weapons into Mexico has become a virtual bloodsport in both countries. In 2009, the General Accounting Office said (see pdf ) that over 90 percent of the weapons used by criminal gangs in Mexico came from the United States. Gun lobbyists and other analysts say the weapons come from other sources, such as Central American military stocks, something InSight Crime has reported on numerous occasions. Mexico's government insists the US is not doing enough to shore up its border and slow the purchase and illegal transfer of weapons into criminals' hands. The criticism is warranted. The ATF's release of data comes amid news that the US House of Representatives voted to cut funding for the bureau's multiple long guns sale reporting program. The program -- the only measure the Obama administration has put in place to curb the flow of guns south -- requires Federal Firearm Licensees (FFLs) in the border states of Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona to report the sale of two or more rifles within five business days, if the rifles accept detachable magazines and ammunition of higher than .22 caliber. The program has affected 8,500 FFLs in the four states, and the reports it generated led to 30 criminal cases with 100 defendants between them in its first six months, Hageman said. The House amendment must still pass the Senate before the program loses funding. However, Mexico's highest office has used the US weapons argument to deflect attention from its own failures. After Mexican criminals burned a casino in Monterrey last year, killing 52 people, in what appeared to be a local battle for control of these gambling houses , President Felipe Calderon said Mexico should not pay the consequences of the US inaction on this issue (see minutes 11-13 of video, below). The new data released by the ATF is unlikely to calm either side. There exists no definitive proof that more of these guns did not cross over the US border with Mexico, nor is there proof that Mexican authorities did not selectively submit requests for guns they were confident had crossed the border. Yet, in scientific circles, 99,000 would be a large enough sampling size to draw some, albeit preliminary, conclusions. And 68,000 weapons is, put simply, a lot. What's more, numerous ATF agents on both sides of the border have told InSight Crime they believe that the vast majority of weapons used by large criminal groups come from the United States. At the heart of the issue is the fact that guns are not easy to trace, mostly due to constant lobbying by gun advocates. The ATF is the only US government agency that conducts firearm traces, and there is no national registry in the United States. The ATF conducts its traces by tracking firearms purchases from initial importers or manufacturers through the chain of sales to licensed gun dealers, ultimately leading to a retail purchaser. Gun dealers are required to hold records of firearms transfers, but gun purchases at private auctions and gun fairs often cloud that trail. And requests that do not include all the data of the firearm make tracing that weapon nearly impossible. The ATF press conference revealing trace data is an about-face in transparency from an agency that has come under increasing scrutiny, mostly for its controversial tactic of allowing weapons to ""walk"" to Mexico in the hopes these weapons would lead to arrests of high-level drug traffickers. The so-called ""Fast and Furious"" case epitomized this strategy. Run from the bureau's Phoenix office, Fast and Furious case agents monitored over 2,000 guns moving through US-based middlemen and presumably into the hands of Mexican criminal organizations. One of these weapons was used in a 2010 ambush on a US border patrol that resulted in the death of customs agent Brian Terry. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Cable: Honduran Military Supplied Weaponry to Cartels. As Mexican cartels infiltrate Central America, corrupt elements within the region's militaries from places like Honduras are providing them with arms far superior to those of local police. But the question remains: Just how many of the weapons used by Mexican cartels come from military stockpiles in Central America versus civilian gun stores in the United States? The question is central. The source of the guns fueling a war that has left over 36,000 dead in Mexico since December 2006, has governments and advocate groups on both sides of the border pointing fingers. Mexico is reportedly considering suing U.S. gunmakers, reports CBS News. But gun stores along the U.S. border states are only one source of weaponry used in Mexico. As InSight has reported, Guatemala's military stockpiles have been filtered illegally to the Zetas criminal gang. On top of this, according to a 2008 U.S. diplomatic cable first obtained by WikiLeaks and recently released by McClatchy , the Honduran military has ""lost"" several U.S.-supplied military weapons in recent years. The cable, avaliable below, cites a Defense Intelligence Agency report entitled ""Honduras: Military Weapons Fuel Black Arms Market,"" which noted that the serial numbers on light anti-tank weapons recovered in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico and San Andres Island, Colombia, matched the numbers on guns that had previously been sold to Honduras. In addition to the guns, U.S. authorities seized a number of M433 grenades from criminal groups in Mexico, which were also traced back to the Honduran army. Such revelations, when paired with recent allegations of high-level government links to drug trafficking in Honduras , present a dim forecast for anti-arms trafficking efforts in Central America. They also add fuel to an already heated debate over the cartels' main source of arms. While testifying to the U.S. Senate on March 30, General Douglas Fraser, the head of the U.S. Southern Command, implied that corrupt military officers in Central America bear most of the responsibility for arming Mexican drug traffickers. ""Over 50 percent of the military-type weapons that are flowing throughout the region have a large source between Central American stockpiles, if you will, left over from wars and conflicts in the past,"" said Fraser. Since then, major media outlets like the AFP and McClatchy have picked up the comment, casting it as proof that Central American military arms are fueling Mexico's drug violence. But while General Fraser's comment that over 50 percent of ""military-type"" weapons come from Central America may be true, it is misleading. The weapons coming from Central America only account for military-grade arms, which include anti-tank weapons as well as M-16 and G36 assault rifles. The civilian versions of these weapons, such as the AR-15 and the AK-47 variants, account for many more of the seizures made in Mexico, according to several United States Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) sources consulted by InSight. Indeed, ATF agents have repeatedly told InSight that the most commonly carried weapons by cartel foot soldiers are modified, automatic AK-47 variants from Romania and China. These cheaper versions are readily available in many American gun stores and bought, legally, by straw buyers at the behest of middlemen who sell them, illegally, en masse to the cartels in Mexico.

Webster, Director WHA/CEN Reason(s) 1.4 (a),(b), (c), and (d). 1. (U) Action request contained in paras 2 and 3. 2. (S/NF) Summary: The USG has become aware that light antitank weapons (LAWs) and grenades supplied to Honduras under the Foreign Military Sales program were recovered in Mexico and Colombia. The Department's Bureau of Political Military Affairs is preparing a congressional notification (required by Section 3 of the Arms Export Control Act) regarding the possible unauthorized diversion, misuse or failure to secure such U.S.origin defense articles or defense services by the Government of Honduras (GOH). The Embassy is requested to raise this issue with appropriate GOH officials to ensure that GOH officials understand their legal end-use obligations with respect to control of U.S.-origin defense articles, that USG end-use monitoring is being completed, and that failure to fulfill their obligations may jeopardize certain aspects of future bilateral security cooperation. OBJECTIVES 3. (SBU) Department requests Embassy pursue the following objectives with appropriate GOH Ministries of Defense (MOD) and Foreign Affairs (MFA) officials -- To remind GOH that is has retransfer, end-use and security obligations with respect to defense articles or defense services sold or granted by the U.S. -- To ensure that the GOH realizes the importance of ensuring especially weapons, supplied under U.S. military assistance programs to prevent unauthorized transfers. -- To gain GOH commitment to accept responsibility for investigating unauthorized diversions and punish appropriately those held responsible. -- To obtain GOH action to strengthen controls on import/export of weapons and other military equipment. -- Reiterate U.S. support for on-going weapons destruction programs or new requests for future programs. Express U.S. willingness to provide physical security and/or stockpile management assistance to the GOH if requested. BACKGROUND 4. (S/NF) On July 9, 2008, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) published a report entitled ""Honduras: Military Weapons Fuel Black Arms Market"". According to the DIA report, three light anti-tank weapons (LAWs) were recovered in Mexico City in January 2008, and one was recovered in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico in April 2008. Six more LAWs were recovered on San Andres Island, Colombia in March 2008. Factory markings analysis of lot and serial numbers undertaken by DIA's Military Materiel Identification Division (CHUCKWAGON)/MIO-5 indicates that these LAWs were part of a shipment of fifty sent to the Honduran 2nd Infantry Battalion's TESON training element. The LAWs were originally transferred to Honduras in 1992 as part of a U.S. Foreign Military Sales program. (C/HND) In April 2008, an investigation undertaken by the Honduran military found that the 2nd Infantry Battalion's TESON training element could not account for 26 of these fifty LAWs. (S/NF) In addition, at least two U.S.-produced M433 40-mm grenades have beenrecovered in Colombia and Mexico, according to credible sources with direct access cited in the DIA report. The only foreign military sale of M433 40-mm grenades was to Honduras in 1985. 5. (U) For more information on this issue please contact WHA/CEN: Rebecca M.

"Justice Dept Under Fire for Mexico Weapons Sting. The debate over a United States gun trafficking probe known as Operation Fast and Furious is heating up, and the Justice Department is facing questions over its knowledge of the program, which allegedly allowed thousands of guns to ""walk"" over the border into Mexico. But are they looking in the wrong direction? In a House Judiciary Committee Hearing on May 3, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder found himself the target of sharp criticism over the role the Department of Justice and its lead agency on the case, the Bureau of Alchohol, Tobacco and Firearm's (ATF), played in Fast and Furious. Most criticism has focused on the operation's main strategy: allowing suspected ""straw buyers"" to purchase large quantities of semi-automatic military-style rifles and pistols, in order to track the weapons back to Mexican drug traffickers. According to a partial transcript of the hearing released by the office of Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA), the congressman accused Holder of trying to cover up his previous knowledge of the program. Issa even insinuated that the Department of Justice bore some responsibility for the death of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry, who was killed by a Mexican cartel in December. Weapons found at the scene of Terry's death were traced to Fast and Furious. When Holder dismissed this allegation as unfounded and offensive, Issa asked: ""So what am I going to tell Agent Terry's mother about how he died at the hand of a gun that was videotaped as it was sold to a straw purchaser fully expecting it to end up in the hands of drug cartels?"" Ever since this controversy first began, Holder has taken care to distance his department from the program, saying it has a strict policy against allowing weapons to cross into Mexico. In a letter sent to Issa and Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) on May 2, Holder's office said: ""It remains our understanding that ATF's Operation Fast and Furious did not knowingly permit straw buyers to take guns into Mexico."" However, interviews with a Phoenix ATF agent who was involved in the operation suggest otherwise. In a recent CBS investigation , agent John Dodson alleges that the ""gun walking"" strategy was approved by the Department of Justice, and was part of a larger anti-drug effort. The purpose of the operation, Dodson told CBS, was to see where the guns ended up, and use this information to build strong legal cases against Mexican cartels. Now, a document released by Issa and Grassley's congressional investigators seems to support this claim. According to a March 10, 2010 memo sent from Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer , the Department of Justice approved a wiretap application for suspects targeted in Fast and Furious. The fact that the ATF was able to get blanket wiretapping approval for the operation undercuts Holder's claims that his department had no knowledge of its workings. The review process for wiretap applications involves an extensive assessment of the merits of surveillance as well as the initial evidence collected, and must be approved by a judge. Before approving the wiretapping request, Department of Justice officials would have had access to the specific design of the operation, and therefore must have known that it involved allowing individuals to purchase suspicious quantities of arms. Ultimately, however, the debate misses the real issue. As InSight has previously pointed out , purchasing multiple assault rifles is not, in and of itself, illegal. What's more, the threshold of evidence needed to prosecute straw buyers is extremely high, which makes cases against these individuals tricky to pursue. Holder's (potentially feigned) ignorance is not helping the issue. In order to reshape the debate, he and the Department of Justice need to fully disclose their role in operations like Fast and Furious, offering an informed defense of their purpose: to get to the larger players in the scheme. Although controversial, such operations are needed both in order to arrest gun-running ringleaders and to help ATF officials understand how weapons are trafficked below the border, none of which can happen if the U.S. authorities limit themselves to arresting suspected straw buyers.

"Woodrow Wilson Center: U.S. Firearms Trafficking to Mexico: New Data and Insights Illuminate Key Trends and Challenges. In a study written by Colby Goodman and Michel Marizco in September 2010, for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Mexico Institute, at the University of San Diego, Goodman and Marizco examine the problem of U.S. arms trafficking to Mexico. The authors identify the most common firearms purchased in the U.S. and recovered in Mexico: the AK-47 type semi-automatic rifles and AR-15 semi-automatic rifle clones. The authors argue that the way DTOs have made use of these automatic weapons has also changed. Government pursuit of the Mexican cartels has disturbed the equilibrium of power, and now more DTO operatives are willing to use weapons in all-out combat, rather than in selective or targeted killings. The report admits that even describing the extent of the problem is difficult due to incomplete data from Mexican agencies and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Policy recommendations include further implementation of the e-trace system in Mexico, an electronic system for tracing weapons, which allows Mexican security forces to better submit trace requests to the ATF. Better data would create stronger cases for prosecuting ""straw purchasers,"" or middlemen arm dealers. From the report's executive summary: This report seeks to answer the following questions: 1) what are the main types of firearms DTOs are using, including those trafficked to Mexico from the United States, and how do these firearms compare with the firepower of Mexican authorities; 2) how are DTOs using these firearms; 3) what are the major methods firearms traffickers are using to buy these weapons and transport them to Mexico; 4) have their been any successes in curbing such firearms trafficking; 5) what are the remaining challenges; and, 6) what can be done to improve efforts to curb U.S. firearms trafficking to Mexico? As there has also been confusion regarding related statistics, the authors have elaborated on what the data shows and what it does not show. Read full report. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"InSight Map: Arms Trafficking in Bogota. The black market for firearms in Bogota made profits of approximately $4.9 million between 2009 and 2010, according to city officials. InSight has developed a map showing that many of the center points for arm sales are located on the city's outskirts, near the major exits points to one of Colombia's most conflicted regions, the Eastern Plains Authorities in Bogota seized 5,177 weapons last year, according to daily newspaper El Tiempo , including grenade launchers, machine guns, rifles and pistols. The weapons most in demand are 9mm pistols and 7.65 semi-automatics, and .32 and .38 revolvers, city officials told the newspaper. Similarly to Medellin, where the troubled barrio Comuna 13 has long been a centerpoint for gang activity and weapons trade, due to its proximity to Highway 62 leading all the way to the coast, much of the arms activity in Bogota appears to be based in the southeast, which is the gateway to the Eastern Plains. This offers easy access to Villavicencio and onwards through Meta, where both the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) and the Popular Antiterrorist Army of Colombia (Ejercito Popular Antiterrorista de Colombia - ERPAC) remain active. Bogota has a lower homicide rate compared to Cali and Medellin when it comes to homicides committed by firearms. What may make the city an important center for the arms trade, especially for the rural southeast, is because Bogota is after all the logistical capital for the armed forces. The military and police are not thought to be a major source of arms for criminal groups, but corruption does exist. Fudged inventories would allow seized weapons to recycle back into the city's black market. There are two types of weapons trade in major cities like Bogota and Medellin: the most common involves the renting of arms for short periods of time, most frequently for hired assasins looking to avoid using a traceable weapon. Criminals also rent weapons for small-time jobs like robberies or bus hijackings. Depending on the type of firearm, renting a weapon can cost anywhere between 100 thousand pesos (about $52) and 1.5 million pesos (about $786), while purchasing a gun will cost between 165,000 pesos (about $87) and 37 million pesos (about $19,400), El Tiempo reports. The second type of urban weapons trade involves illegal groups looking to expand their arsenals. The drug-trafficking bands descended from the paramilitaries, called ""criminal bands"" (bandas criminales - BACRIMS) by the government, are believed to represent one of the greatest demands for weapons on the black market. The arsenal for BACRIMS consists mostly of recycled weapons which were never turned over to the government during the demobilization process. The FARC and the National Liberation Army (Ejercito Nacional de Liberacion - ELN) have also tyically represented a major demand for weapons in the black market. But there are indications that with the decline of the power of these groups, many guerrilla fronts are making do with older model AK-47s and Galil assault rifles. The typical source of weapons for these groups has been arms coming in from the international market, occassionally diverted illegally from the arsenals of the security forces in neighboring countries like Peru. InSight has developed a map showing the center points of the weapons trade in Bogota. The blue placemarks represent the areas where the most weapons were seized last year. The red placemarks represent the areas where weapons are reportedly most commonly bought, sold and rented. View Bogota Arms Trafficking in a larger map "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Latin America Lacks Regional Strategy to Halt Bitcoin Money Laundering. Despite a steep drop in their overall value over the last 18 months and a raft of interdictions by Latin American countries, cryptocurrencies continue to offer a convenient haven for groups to launder criminal proceeds. In late April, agents from Brazil's Department of Narcotics Investigations (Departamento de Investigacoes sobre Narcoticos - DENARC) captured a man running a clandestine cryptocurrency mining laboratory in the city of Porto Alegre. Investigators were tracking a drug trafficking operation and admitted to being surprised by the discovery. ""Everything indicates that this was a bitcoin mining activity. They could make payments for drug dealers, and there is also the options of using money from drug trafficking to buy bitcoins,"" said a police officer attached to the case. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Money Laundering Authorities seized 25 cryptocurrency mining machines, which ran 24 hours a day. The assembled technology had an estimated value of $65,000 and was thought to have been illegally smuggled from China. Cryptocurrency mining is a technique that allows for the creation of bitcoins and the validation of transactions made with the currency, all powered by a network of computers requiring a vast amount of energy. Despite the value of bitcoin being significantly lower than at its height in 2017, it remains attractive to criminals since dirty money can be laundered and transferred without any type of oversight or state control. This is hardly the first case involving money laundering through cryptocurrencies in the region. In April 2018, the Spanish Civil Guard dismantled a criminal structure that bought bitcoins with illegal proceeds and sent the ""legalized"" money to accounts in Colombia. In total, the group used 174 bank accounts to launder $9.3 million. Limited legislation in Latin America to prevent such operations and the limited control financial authorities can wield over cryptocurrencies have made it an optimal plan for criminal structures seeking to clean shady money. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), one of the main international organizations fighting the misuse of new technologies for criminal activities, has made constant calls for Latin American nations to do more. SEE ALSO : Venezuela's New Digital Currency: Economic Gamble or Digital Scam? In October 2018, the FATF updated its recommendations about how states should deal with virtual assets. ""There is an urgent need for countries to take coordinated measures to prevent the use of virtual assets for crime and terrorism Bitcoin is now the most common form of payment for drug sales on black markets. It is becoming a desirable method to transfer illicit drug revenues internationally,"" it read. Currently, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico are the only Latin American members of the FATF, but other countries have taken steps. In 2016, Colombia's central bank banned the country's financial institutions from receiving any payments in cryptocurrencies. In 2017, Bolivia did the same , banning all use of cryptocurrencies not issued or regulated by its central financial entity. Finally, in 2018, Ecuador unauthorized the use of bitcoin as a legal means of payment. However, these remain isolated attempts to halt a transnational crisis, in the absence of a coordinated regional strategy. It also remains to be seen whether any such strategy would even have an impact, when Latin American criminal groups have found a safe haven to launder money through Chinese cryptocurrency platforms."	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Have Cryptocurrencies Really Helped Venezuela Sidestep US Sanctions?Venezuela is collecting airport taxes through an application that converts these funds into Bitcoin, demonstrating the country's continuing use of cryptocurrencies to evade US sanctions. Since February 2018, Venezuela's Simon Bolivar International Airport outside the capital Caracas has required airlines to pay for operational services through an application called Jetman Pay, according to ABC International. This converts the airport taxes into Bitcoin, allowing them to be transferred to international exchange houses in Hong Kong, Russia, China and Hungary. There, they are converted into dollars and deposited into accounts held by the Venezuelan government. In this way, the Venezuelan regime has been attempting to build up its foreign currency reserves in defiance of US sanctions. Additionally, Jetman Pay is owned by BCDA Aeronautical Solutions, a Florida-based firm which collects two percent of all fees levied this way at the airport, according to service contracts seen by ABC. This means a US-based company may be helping Venezuela avoid sanctions. This is not the only example of Venezuela turning to cryptocurrencies -- digital currencies that are regulated through encryption techniques, independently of a central bank. In early 2018, President Nicolas Maduro launched an oil-backed digital currency known as the Petro. At the time, this was hailed by Venezuelan deputy Andres Eloy Mendez as a key tool in evading the "" financial and commercial blockade "" imposed by the United States. The US Treasury Department responded by banning US citizens from buying the Petro, describing the currency as ""another attempt to prop up the Maduro regime, while further looting the resources of the Venezuelan people."" Although Maduro's administration still sees cryptocurrencies as an expedient means to flout US sanctions, the continuing use of Bitcoin in Venezuela's airport tax scheme suggests that international cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are proving more useful than the Petro. ""Every currency depends on trust Venezuela and its officials are not trustworthy, so anything they create can be manipulated afterwards,"" Rodrigo Andragnes, executive director of the non-governmental organization Bitcoin Argentina, told BBC Mundo. He points out that the Petro has already been manipulated. It was originally backed only by oil, but it is now more vaguely linked to all Venezuelan subsoil resources. Another result of the Petro experiment is that it has likely helped Venezuela develop the knowledge and institutions necessary to exploit opportunities offered by other cryptocurrencies. Although it uses Bitcoin, the airport tax scheme is coordinated by the National Superintendency of Crypto Assets and Related Activities (Superintendencia Nacional de Criptoactivos y Actividades Conexas --Sunacrip), an agency created to manage Petro distribution. Publicly, Maduro continues to proclaim confidence in the Petro. In July 2019, he ordered Venezuela's Central Bank to accept transactions in the cryptocurrency, and also announced plans to distribute one million ""Petro wallets"" among Venezuelan citizens. But these domestic uses are a far cry from the Petro's original purpose as an international currency free from US controls. The Petro is not traded in international cryptocurrency exchange houses, a clear sign of its lack of global traction. For now, it seems to survive only because Venezuelans are obliged to pay taxes based on the rate of the Petro. Even Russia, Venezuela's major international ally, appears to have lost faith in the currency. After initial attempts to use the Petro for trade between the two countries, they are now switching back to the ruble. In March 2019, the US Treasury Department sanctioned the Russian bank Evrofinance Mosnarbank for its role in financing the Petro , the only time a foreign firm has been linked to the new cryptocurrency."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"US Arrests Honduras Elite for Allegedly Laundering Corruption Proceeds. The US arrest of a man tied to a graft scheme involving one of Honduras' largest government institutions is a clear sign of the limits to Washington's leniency with its regional allies as well as a demonstration of the Honduran government's inability to prosecute corrupt elites. On May 1, the US Justice Department announced the arrest of Carlos Zelaya, who is accused of conspiring to launder more than $1 million from bribes and misappropriated funds from the Honduran Social Security Institute (Instituto Hondureno de Seguridad Social - IHSS). His brother, Mario Zelaya, the former president of the social security institute from 2010 to 2014, during the presidency of Porfirio Lobo, was arrested in September 2016 near the Honduras-Nicaragua border after living as a fugitive for seven months. In 2017, he was convicted of a series of crimes in connection with the embezzlement of more than $300 million from the IHSS, according to a report by La Prensa. Carlos Zelaya is accused of conspiring with his brother to launder more than $1.3 million through international electronic transfers that he then used to purchase property in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he had been living. Part of this money could be the product of a series of bribes paid by two Honduran business leaders to Mario Zelaya when he ran the IHSS. Carlos Zelaya is also suspected of having used his brother's position to benefit from lucrative Honduran government contracts and to have laundered that money in New Orleans as well. The bribes occurred during the administration of former President Porfirio Lobo, whose son, Fabio Lobo, was sentenced to 24 years in US prison for drug trafficking in September 2017. Moreover, Porfirio Lobo's wife, Rosa Elena Bonilla de Lobo, was detained in Honduras in February on charges including misappropriation of public funds, money laundering and conspiracy. In the US case against Fabio Lobo, Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, the leader of drug trafficking group known as the Cachiros, named former President Porfirio Lobo in his testimony. According to a report by El Heraldo, Rivera testified that the Cachiros gave the senior Lobo up to $500,000 in exchange for various favors, but the ex-president has yet to face charges in Honduras. Carlos Zelaya's arrest in New Orleans on money laundering charges illustrates the complex position the United States has had to adopt when its allies fail to bring successful corruption cases against their political elites -- particularly when those individuals go on to commit crimes in US territory. After learning of the arrest, the top US diplomat in Honduras, Heide Fulton, tweeted that the United States ""will not be a refuge for those who intend to flee from justice in Honduras, nor will [its] financial system be used to launder funds stolen from the Honduran people."" The Attorney General's Office in Honduras began its investigation into the IHSS at the end of 2013, later revealing that leadership within the National Party (Partido Nacional) of current President Juan Orlando Hernandez received at least $90 million from the institute via more than 10 ghost companies. As InSight Crime has reported , after Hernandez admitted in 2015 that businesses linked to the IHSS embezzlement had financed his campaign, massive protests took the country by storm. These protests were one of the main precursors to the creation of the Support Mission Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (Mision de Apoyo contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad en Honduras - MACCIH). However, despite accusations of links between his inner circle and organized crime, Hernandez is one of the US government's closest allies in the region. In fact, the United States supported Hernandez when his reelection at the end of 2017 was plagued by allegations of fraud and violent political repression. Meanwhile, the MACCIH has faced a series of roadblocks from the Honduran political elite, the most recent of which was the decision of three appeals court judges to dismiss some of the charges against former first lady Bonilla de Lobo. According to El Heraldo, the Attorney General's Office has criticized the decision and plans to appeal it."	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"Former El Salvador President to Stand Trial for Money Laundering. A former president in El Salvador is set to stand trial for allegedly embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars from the state to personal accounts, which could lead to him becoming the first former president of the Central American nation to face a criminal conviction and jail time on such charges. Elias Antonio Saca, who was president of El Salvador from 2004 to 2009, and six other members of his administration, will stand trial for allegedly embezzling $300 million from state coffers into personal accounts, La Prensa Grafica reported. Saca and his associates were arrested in October 2016 on corruption charges and accused of embezzlement, illicit association and money laundering. According to Factum , Saca passed a law shortly after taking office in 2004 that approved the ""internal regulation of the use of public funds."" This allowed him to divert hundreds of millions of dollars from the state's accounts through checks and money transfers into his own personal accounts and those of his collaborators and their companies, without leaving much evidence. (Graphic courtesy of La Prensa Grafica) As InSight Crime previously reported , the Attorney General's Office said that the law ""shows that from the start of the position [the presidency of Saca] they planned the way they were going to manage the embezzlement of state funds and how they were going to create impunity."" If convicted, Saca and the other defendants could face up to 25 years in jail. The former president has denied these allegations and will remain in detention throughout the trial, Reuters reported. The Attorney General's Office in El Salvador has a pretty strong case against former president Saca and his alleged role in embezzling hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars into personal accounts. The start of his trial brings him one step closer to potentially becoming the first former president from the Northern Triangle nation to face criminal conviction and jail time for this kind of charges. The case against Saca is a stark example of the lengths corrupt politicians will go to and the criminal schemes they will use in order to launder money stolen from the state -- a trend seen elsewhere in the region -- to benefit themselves and their closest allies. As the evidence suggests, the fact that Saca and his co-conspirators laid out a premeditated plan through the creation of a law at the start of his presidency to steal money from the state -- and cover it up -- shows how organized and thought out his criminal scheme was. While Saca is not the first former president in El Salvador to face corruption accusations , the mounting evidence against him, including witness testimony detailing meetings where it was agreed to move the state's money into private accounts, may be enough to secure a criminal conviction and make him the first former president of El Salvador to be sentenced to jail time."	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"Panama Attorney General: Elites Attempting to Interfere With Graft Probes. Panama's attorney general has warned that political and economic elites have made threats against anti-graft prosecutors, mirroring a pattern seen in other countries in Latin America with major unfolding corruption investigations. ""I have to inform the country that there are economic, political, business, media and banking powers that are attempting to prevent the investigations from being completed,"" Attorney General Kenia Porcell said in a striking video published on August 29 by La Estrella. The country's top law enforcement official warned that ""threats and intimidations"" had been issued against prosecutors working on five of the most ""emblematic"" corruption cases concerning money laundering and embezzlement of public funds. Porcell described the situation as a crucial moment for the country, and a metaphorical battle of ""money versus justice."" Although Porcell did not specify which cases were concerned, the attorney general did say that networks of corrupt officials siphoning government funds had been discovered. Porcell's public intervention has led the chamber of commerce and private business actors to voice their support for the investigations, while Libertad Ciudadana, the Panamanian branch of the Transparency International corruption watchdog, called on the attorney general to reveal the names and pursue the individuals interfering with the investigations, La Estrella reported. While uncertainty remains as to which corruption cases are allegedly being tampered with, the Panamanian newspaper La Prensa claimed that these included such schemes as the wide-ranging scandal involving Brazil's Odebrecht construction conglomerate and the allegedly improper acquisition of radars from the Finmeccanica Italian defense company. In total, 20 corruption cases are currently being investigated in the country, according to Libertad Ciudadana's latest monitoring report , published in July 2017.

"Mexicos $400 Million Swindle: An Interview With Animal Politicos Tania Montalvo. More than $430 million of misused federal funds, 128 fictitious or irregular companies and 50 government officials. They all form part of a huge embezzlement scheme, uncovered in a multi-part, multi-media Animal Politico* and Mexicans against Corruption and Impunity (Mexicanos Contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad - MCCI) investigation. InSight Crime interviewed Tania Montalvo, the editor and general coordinator of the project, who told us about the investigation's major findings and how it was conducted. Simply put, the scheme was massive. During 2013 and 2014, Mexico's federal government contracted nearly 7.7 billion pesos [$430 million] worth of public contracts. Of the 186 private companies that secured the bids, 128 were found to either not exist or have irregularities that should have barred them from any bidding process. The contracting processes also included eight public universities that were used as intermediaries for no apparent reason other than to collect a commission of between 10 and 15 percent. In the end, more than 3.4 billion pesos [over $190 million] simply disappeared. InSight Crime: How did the investigation start? Tania Montalvo: Every year, the Government Accountability Office [Auditoria Superior de la Federacion - ASF] releases a report on last year's public expenditures. The auditor always raises some irregularities or red flags. For 2013 and 2014, the auditor pointed to irregular agreements between federal entities and public universities, saying that this started back in 2010. But the auditing body's powers are limited. They cannot probe the private entities to follow the funds' trail. IC: How did you follow that trail then? TM: We started going through the auditing reports to list the state entities and the 73 agreements signed with public universities in 2013 and 2014. And with this database, we picked up the money trail where the accountability office had left off, gathering information on all the companies involved. Then came the field work. We went and checked the addresses for these companies, found that some weren't where they say they were, others were officially registered to home addresses of people who had never heard of them, etc. [See video in Spanish below.] But we could only find 3.4 billion pesos [$190 million] traced to these irregular companies, so around half of the total sum involved. We broadened our investigation, and discovered that roughly a billion pesos [$56 million] had landed in the universities [as] commissions. As for the rest, it appears to have financed certain services, but at an inflated price. In total, building and analyzing the database, field work and redaction required nine or ten months. Courtesy of Animal Politico IC: Did you encounter any form of pressure or face any issues collecting this information? TM: In the field -- in Villahermosa, Tabasco, for example -- our reporters had to be cautious because the companies' headquarters were registered in violent areas. But we were never threatened or intimidated. Officials are denying everything, of course, but our investigation is rock-solid. [The cabinet's body in charge of revising government activities -- Secretaria de la Funcion Publica -- published a press release on September 4, noting that the government had taken action in the past against certain state entities, and that it would consider any new information presented in the investigation by Animal Politico and MCCI's investigation. The investigation's online platform also provides links to all replies from entities or individuals concerned in the case. Animal Politico has replied to certain denials.] IC: Coming back to the modus operandi of signing conventions with universities, is it legal? TM: It is legal, but they are doing it illegally. The public procurement law states that public entities can sign contracts with one another. But the contracted entity must be fully capable of delivering the services and cannot subcontract more than 49 percent of the deal's total value. None of these two criteria are respected. The universities subcontract between 85 and 90 percent [of the work]. Weeks or days after signing the agreements, they declare themselves incapable of delivering the services, which isn't surprising, given that none of these [contracts] relate to education or research. IC: Do we know who the owners of the 128 irregular companies are? TM: We have identified them in several cases. The Pemex story is interesting in that regard because we discovered the use of front men. The companies are officially in the name of extremely poor people, mostly from Tabasco, who had no idea they were the owners of a multimillion [peso] company. A Tabasco prosecutor told us that the trafficking of false documents used to register a company was a problem in the state. What really happens is that people go to extremely poor households, and tell them, ""Look, I'll you give you that much money and in exchange, you lend me your ID and your proof of residence."" No one would tell us exactly how much they were given, and it's impossible to know who got what public monies in the process. Courtesy of Animal Politico IC: How is the money laundered or ""disappeared"" once it is received by the companies? TM: Via completely illegal transfers. One company, for example, received 700 million pesos [$40 million] from the Secretariat of Social Development [Secretaria de Desarrollo Social - SEDESOL] without a signed contract. Sure, the company is registered and pays taxes. But it never declared this $40 million as income. As we write in our case study of SEDESOL , this lack of oversight points to significant legal and institutional shortcomings. IC: About the criminal structures: Are we talking about a single network of 50 officials, or various networks? TM: These are different networks per institution using the same modus operandi with minor differences: A state entity signs a convention with a university, the latter declares itself incompetent while keeping a hefty commission, [and] subcontracts companies, at which point the money either vanishes or is spent on overpriced services. IC: Were links established between the individuals involved? TM: Yes. If you look at the Pemex case, the companies have been set up by former Pemex officials. And if you dig deeper, you'll see, for example, the company transferring the funds to another firm, owned by the former official's daughter, which then creates a joint venture with yet another company owned by a second daughter, [and the joint venture is set] to receive a separate government contract. IC: Given that the scheme dates back to at least 2010, does that mean the criminal structures have been operating since Felipe Calderon's 2006 to 2012 administration? TM: Certain conventions executed in 2013 were actually signed in 2012 or 2011, so during the Calderon administration. But the ASF said the scheme really started picking up speed in 2013, when it became institutionalized. IC: What measures should the government or congress adopt to stop this type of corruption? TM: The public procurements law should be reformed to require the head of the public institution to sign off on every contract [a measure pushed by the government's chief auditor. See interview video in Spanish below]. At the moment, these agreements are approved by mid-level officials. Like the chief auditor suggests, this signature would shift the responsibility to the head of the entity, who would think twice before spending the funds. [Right now], if anybody goes to prison, it will be a mid-level official, who didn't necessarily know he was embezzling funds, and could have simply followed a verbal order. Courtesy of Animal Politico IC: What does your investigation tell us about broader criminal dynamics, especially as they relate to elites and organized crime? TM: What we've uncovered so far for 2013 and 2014 appears to be the largest documented embezzlement scheme [in Mexican history]. And since 2010, approximately 2,000 agreements have been signed, whose total value we estimate at 31.5 billion pesos [nearly $1.8 billion]. We don't how much of that money was embezzled. What we did realize is that this is only the tip of the iceberg of possible embezzlement schemes involving much larger sums, with a similar modus operandi. *Animal Politico is a partner organization of InSight Crime.

Weekly InSight: Mexico Violence, Money Laundering and Brazil-Paraguay Narco War. In our March 30 Facebook Live session, Senior Investigator Deborah Bonello and Senior Editor Mike LaSusa discussed some of the main stories that we covered this week: a wave of recent violence against journalists in Mexico, the importance of tackling illicit financial flows in the fight against organized crime, and a brewing narco war on the border between Brazil and Paraguay. The conversation began with Bonello explaining how a spate of recent attacks against journalists in Mexico fits into broader patterns of insecurity. She also discussed some of the shortcomings of Mexico's security policies, which were reflected in recent homicide statistics from the country's 50 most violent municipalities. The discussion then shifted to a recent report from the advocacy group Global Financial Integrity, which estimated that the total annual revenue generated by transnational organized crime around the globe could amount to as much as $2.2 trillion. LaSusa explained how the report's conclusions relate to criminal dynamics in the Americas, and why its authors advocate for a greater focus on combating illicit financial flows in order to disrupt the operations of organized crime. Bonello and LaSusa also talked about recent violence on the border between Brazil and Paraguay, where local drug trafficking groups appear to be engaged in a battle over important smuggling routes. As they discussed, one of the main questions about these incidents is whether or not they are related to a recent -- and bloody -- feud between Brazil's two biggest prison gangs, both of which are known to operate in that area.

"A Third of Argentina Money Laundering Cases Linked to Drug Trafficking. Official data from Argentina's Attorney General's Office indicates that more than a third of money laundering cases since 2013 were linked to drug trafficking, a figure which highlights an important aspect of the country's growing role in the drug trade. According to the Economic Crime and Money Laundering Bureau (Procuraduria de Criminalidad Economica y Lavado de Activos - PROCELAC) of the Attorney General's Office, 34 percent of the money laundering cases it opened since its creation in December 2012 were linked to drug trafficking. The numbers, which were were first presented by Argentine authorities during an October 2016 conference with the representatives of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), also show that another 7 percent concerned dirty money from human trafficking and 5 percent were related to contraband. Gabriel Perez Barbera, one of the two prosecutors in charge of the PROCELAC, told La Nacion that ""34 percent of money laundering cases being linked to drug trafficking means that focus has been brought on one of the most adverse consequence of the drug trade. Drug trafficking doesn't only bring significant harm to the public health, but also to the economy."" Earlier this year, the newspaper Clarin pointed out that Argentina witnessed only nine sentences for laundering of drug money since 1999, while the PROCELAC estimated that drug traffickers had moved 4 billion pesos -- around $260 million at the current market exchange rate -- in the past five years. Argentina's growing role in the drug trade has become increasingly visible in recent years. And although a longstanding activity in the country, money laundering is a telling aspect of that trend. The release of the official data comes a few months after the conclusion of one of the biggest drug trials in Argentine history, the "" White Charcoal "" case. The multi-million dollar scheme that allowed for the shipment of cocaine from Argentina to Europe was headed by a lawyer and revealed the inner workings of white-collar corruption and drug money laundering. The structure's second-in-command, famous football businessman Patricio Gorosito, facilitated the laundering of the drug profits through his connections with European football clubs. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison. SEE ALSO : Coverage of European Organized Crime Just last week, Pope Francis called for greater scrutiny of financial institutions and their role in the laundering money earned from the narcotics trade, while warning of increasing drug consumption in his native Argentina. His words echoed the general perception of the country's evolving drug trade. Money laundering is a longstanding issue in Argentina, with the country repeatedly placed in the US State Department's category of ""jurisdictions of primary concern."" But the agency's latest 2016 report also argues that the country has made significant efforts to build the necessary institutions, including PROCELAC in 2012, to effectively combat this criminal activity."	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
"An Economic Approach to Fighting Mexicos Drug Cartels. Formulating effective strategies to combat Mexico -based crime organizations requires a nuanced understanding of their economic structures, says award-winning Mexican journalist Carlos Loret de Mola. At a November 23 event hosted by the Americas Society/Council of the Americas (AS/COA), Loret gave a presentation entitled "" The Evolving Economics of Mexico's Drug Cartels ,"" in which he argued for an economic approach to tackling organized crime. ""I am totally convinced that there [can be] no war against drugs, there [can be] no law enforcement in terms of cartels, if you don't first of all understandthe economy of the cartels,"" he said. Loret, a columnist for El Universal who also hosts a television show and a radio program, began studying Mexico's drug trade as a university student in the late 1990s. Since then, he says, several factors have combined to create ""a whole new world"" for organized crime in Mexico. The defeat of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Mexico's 2000 election cycle disrupted long-standing arrangements between cartels and corrupt politicians that had formed during the PRI's 71 years in power. At the same time, some criminal groups that previously focused mainly on drug trafficking began branching out into more violent criminal activities , like kidnapping and extortion. Additionally, Loret argues, due to increased US border security after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, ""a lot of drugs stayed in Mexico,"" leading to the growth of domestic retail drug markets. Over the past two decades, Mexican crime groups also deepened their relationships with foreign suppliers of precursor chemicals used for drug production, which has helped them meet rising demand for heroin and methamphetamine on both sides of the border. These shifting market dynamics, combined with the implementation of a ""kingpin strategy"" aimed at taking out top cartel leaders, contributed to the ongoing fragmentation of Mexico's underworld , which, according to Loret, set the stage for the development of several distinct business models for Mexico-based crime organizations. One is the model of "" La Tuta ,"" the recently captured leader of the Knights Templar , who concentrated his organization's efforts on using coercion to extract profits from individuals and industries in areas under the group's control. The other model is that of "" El Chapo ,"" the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. ""He avoids confrontation with the government"" and focuses almost entirely on drug trafficking, Loret said. ""He doesn't go into kidnapping. He doesn't go into extortion."" ""In between,"" Loret added, ""you can find something like Los Zetas "" or the Gulf Cartel. ""They do not work like El Chapo in terms of not messing around with anybody. They do not work like La Tuta , seizing almost every activity of the local economy. But they tax,"" he says, charging ""protection"" fees to local businesses and other criminals seeking to operate in areas they control. For Loret, money laundering is ""the key issue"" when it comes to fighting the cartels. And he says policymakers have been slow to recognize this, continuing to rely instead on an outdated strategy of attempting to capture kingpins and deploying large numbers of security personnel to areas with high crime rates. Such policies often fail to have a long-term impact on crime and violence while contributing to the migration and decentralization of criminal networks , thereby making them harder to dismantle. Although it may sound simple in theory, tackling the issue of illicit financial flows has proven difficult in practice. Criminal groups have adopted sophisticated methods of laundering their profits. Moreover, banks and other financial institutions have an incentive to resist enforcing or adopting strict anti-money laundering standards. ""We can expect, except for a few cases of unprecedented honesty, for banks to cover up the origins of dirty money,"" Loret told InSight Crime. ""Raising penalties for banks who engage in these types of activities would work if the government is capable of detecting the illegal flows of cash and those institutions that allow them to come through, but this isn't the case: governments fail to detect these, so who is left to sanction?"" In addition to improving the capacity of law enforcement to clamp down on illicit financial flows, Loret argues, governments should concentrate their efforts on investigating and understanding criminal economies. ""For the poor farmers that work for the narco cartels, whenever they have a choice, it's a surviving choice. It's not an ambition thing,"" he said. ""It's because of the state not being able to provide good jobs, good opportunities, and some sort of future for them that they become farmers for the local cartels."" ""When looking at the narcoeconomy, we can conclude that the government's aim is not to completely eradicate drug cartels,"" Loret said. ""The sudden disappearance of drug cartels would trigger a brutal economic crisis that no government wants to have in their territory. I believe governments are actually trying to reduce the negative externalities of the illicit activities: less violence (executions, extortions, kidnappings, etc.) and less hard drugs available in the internal market."" In his presentation, Loret also stated that he supports drug legalization. He pointed out that drug prohibition amplifies the profitability of substances like marijuana and heroin, which are cheap and easy to produce but can be sold at high markups once they are trafficked to foreign markets. ""I think the strategies that have been implemented so far have failed. So why not try something different?"" he said. Loret also highlighted the necessity for international cooperation in combating organized crime, specifically citing the United States as the country best positioned to provide financial and technical assistance. ""These are international organizations who can have people across not only the continent but in Asia and EuropeThese are multinationals, and they work as multinationals,"" he said. ""No country can fight this by themselves."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Did El Salvadors Attorney General Protect Chepe Diablo?In this article, the role of El Salvador Attorney General Luis Martinez in obstructing investigations into the Texis Cartel, and its supposed leader ""Chepe Diablo,"" come under scrutiny at a time when Martinez is being considered for a second term as the country's head prosecutor. Salvadoran Attorney General Luis Martinez, whose reelection was discussed by El Salvador's Legislative Assembly on December 3, made changes to the prosecution team assigned to cases against the Texis Cartel. He also told his subordinates not to ask a judge for documents in which the Treasury Ministry established the participation of Jose Adan Salazar Umana, Wilfredo Guerre Umana, Juan Umana Samayoa (mayor of Metpan) and the businesses Hotesa S.A. of C.V. and Gumarsal S.A. of C.V., in money laundering and illicit enrichment. El Salvador's Treasury Ministry had concluded that the three businessmen and the two consortiums aligned with the Texis Cartel -- a drug trafficking group based in the northeast of the country -- had committed at least two crimes between 2010 and 2011: money laundering and illicit enrichment. This article was originally published by Factum and was translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission. See the Spanish original here. The Criminal Investigations Unit of the General Tax Directorate of the Treasury Ministry determined these contributors had ""falsified accounting records, fabricated operations established unaccountable and undeclared asset increases in their bank accounts,"" confirmed the government investigators on the case and a lawyer familiar with the initial accusation against Salazar Umana and the suspected Texis Cartel members. A third source from the Treasury Ministry confirmed the findings. The evidence of these crimes were documented in two financial and accounting audits the Treasury Ministry carried out on Hotesa and Gumarsal between 2010 and 2011. According to a summary of these reports, obtained by Factum, ""there was sufficient evidence to justify opening an investigation, due to operational inconsistencies and lack of apparent economic reason"" The Treasury Ministry carried out these audits as part of a tax evasion case against Salazar Umana, Juan Umana Samayoa, and the two companies in San Salvador's Ninth Peace Court. With these findings, as Factum previously reported , the Attorney General's Financial Investigation Unit opened the record labeled 22-UIF-2014. Nevertheless, Attorney General Luis Martinez acted as a defender of ""Chepe Diablo,"" as the businessman had come to be known. In July 2014, the Organized Crime Special Unit seized all formal accounting records of the three people and the two businesses. Prosecutors also began working with the Financial System Superintendent, the National Police's (PNC) Financial Crimes and Forfeitures Division, and Customs and Immigration, in order to assign experts to aid prosecutors in establishing, in court, ""the type of laundering used by those investigated to legitimize identified capital of an unknown origin."" Sources from the three previously mentioned institutes confirmed the prosecutors' requests. What was needed, according to the investigators who participated in the tax evasion case and the initial money laundering inquires, was to exhaustively follow the suspects' money and assets ""through public sources, private records, property, companies, vehicles, taxes, financial institutions and brokerages"" But the Treasury Ministry is not the Attorney General, who is constitutionally responsible for prosecuting and imprisoning criminals. In this case the Treasury did its work to prove Jose Adan Salazar Umana had laundered money and enriched himself through illegal means. Nevertheless, the Attorney General under Luis Martinez acted as a defender of ""Chepe Diablo,"" as the businessman had come to be known. In order to protect him, Martinez asked his prosecutors to suspend a court process in which all the evidence found by the Treasury Ministry would have been added to the case. The Texis Cartel is one of the two criminal groups in El Salvador that traffics drugs, launders money and receives political protection from important business people, according to the United Nation's Office on Drugs and Crime. Investigative journalists determined that Jose Adan Salazar Umana, alias ""Chepe Diablo,"" and Juan Umana Samayoa -- the mayor of Metapan -- are the leaders of this organization. United States President Barack Obama's administration has labeled Chepe Diablo as an international drug trafficking capo. Herbert Saca (left, yellow shirt) is a political operator related to ex-President Antonio Saca and the GANA political party. Juan Umana Samayoa (right, with a purple scarf) is the mayor of Metapan. In other words, under Luis Martinez the Attorney General's Office worked so that Salvadoran justice could push forward money laundering accusations against the only man in El Salvador identified by the White House as an international drug trafficker. The Order to Not Continue Between April and May of 2015 the financial investigations unit asked San Salvador's Second Judge of the Peace to carry out a ""court ordered test,"" a forensic audit or expert financial account. In other words, a judicial act through which prosecutors could formally add the Treasury Ministry's findings to the case of tax evasion and money laundering. The prosecutors had already requested the Eighth Peace Judge to seize all accounting and financial information of the suspected Texis Cartel members, which at the moment was held by the Ninth Peace Judge, where the tax evasion trial was held. In the tax evasion trial, the defendants acknowledged the crime and paid fines of up to a million dollars to the Treasury, at which point the accusation was finished and all the accounting and expert documents were to be returned. In that conversation, Martinez lead the journalist to believe there was no proof against Texis Cartel members. This of course is a lie. To avoid being left without the definitive proof of money laundering already uncovered by the Treasury Ministry, the prosecutors asked for another seizure. Everything looked set for Salvadoran justice's first big money laundering case against a designated international drug trafficker. ""We were ready. We'd studied and defined all the evidence and knew how to prove the money laundering,"" one of the experts told Factum. The expert had been called to testify and agreed to speak anonymously, so as not to put other investigations at risk. Everything looked ready, but was not. That's when the order from above came. Two of the investigators in the money laundering case confirmed that last June the head of the financial investigations unit, Prosecutor Tovias Menjivar, gave the order to cancel the expert financial accounting. The reasoning: that the court building in San Salvador didn't have enough ""physical space"" to contain the audit. (Factum confirmed that in other big cases, audits such as this have been carried out in hearing halls at the central court, such as in the cases against Cel-Enel, OBC or the Perrones.) By August 24, 2015, Tovias Menjivar had already signed an internal order to close the money laundering case. Lastly, the lawyer Alessia Esteffi Herrera Menjivar, who was assigned by Attorney General Martinez to ask the court to return all the seized documents to the Texis Cartel. In other words, the auxiliary prosecutor assigned by the Attorney General asked the judge to return to the suspects the proof that, according to the Treasury Ministry, implicated them in the crimes of money laundering and illicit enrichment. Lawyer Bertha Deleon , the plaintiff in the corruption case against former President Francisco Flores, accused Attorney General Martinez of hiding, seizing and silencing evidence in court that had the potential to incriminate the defendants. The US Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has called Jose Salazar Umana a regional head of drug trafficking. OFAC came to this conclusion by reviewing, among other things, documents similar to those studied by Salvadoran prosecutors: account records, audits, financial movements and commercial relations. A US federal agent , well known in El Salvador, said Chepe Diablo had ""a lot of money which he couldn't explain,"" the same as what Salvadoran Treasury Ministry investigators had established in their report. When he had just arrived at his post and still had support from the US Embassy in San Salvador, Luis Martinez said in public and private that he would make prosecution of the Texis Cartel one of his priorities. However, by August 2015 the official was satisfied with the tax evasion case and dismissed in a conversation continuing the money laundering investigation, according to a journalist at La Prensa Grafica. In that conversation, Martinez lead the journalist to believe there was no proof against Texis Cartel members. This of course is a lie. The Treasury Ministry had indications and evidence that prosecutors were about to bring forward a money laundering court case. But the Attorney General, who was their boss, kept this from happening. Luis Martinez then told La Prensa Grafica: ""There's no reason to listen to people intent on slander and defamation If they have proof they should present it or they should stop making such comments"" In reports made leading up to the case, Treasury Ministry experts said: ""there was sufficient evidence to justify opening an investigation, due to operational inconsistencies and lack of apparent economic reason"" and: ""(The suspects) had falsified accounting records, fabricated operations established unaccountable and undeclared asset increases in their bank accounts."" Factum tried to get the Attorney General's Office's official version of what happened, but as of publication they have not responded. On December 3, Luis Martinez' first term as Attorney General expired. According to many of their respective members, political parties Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) and Gran Alianza por la Unidad Nacional (GANA) consider Martinez an excellent option to continue on as Attorney General. The Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) is divided on the prospect. *This article was originally published by Factum and was translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission.

"Colombians Charged in Massive China-based Money Laundering Scheme. An enormous money laundering scheme in China involving Colombian nationals highlights the growing interaction between Chinese and Latin American criminal groups. US authorities charged three Colombians with participating in a China-based criminal operation which prosecutors say laundered more than $5 billion in drug profits from the United States, parts of Africa, Europe and several countries in Latin America, reported Reuters. The suspected ringleaders, identified as Christian Duque-Aristizabal, alias ""Juguete,"" and Jhon Hincapie-Ramirez, alias ""El Profe,"" are awaiting US extradition in Panama and Colombia, respectively. The third suspect, Henry Poveda, alias ""Calvo,"" is in US custody and considering a plea agreement, according to his lawyer. Dubbed the ""Guangzhou Enterprise,"" the operation consisted mainly of wiring drug money to a host of Chinese businesses like casinos, importers/exporters and factories. That money was then used to buy counterfeit goods that were shipped and sold internationally in exchange for capital not linked to drug trafficking. The three Colombians also allegedly laundered money in their home country through brokers. The brokers would offer drug money (in dollars) at a discount to South American importers, in exchange for ""clean"" Colombian pesos, according to the New York Times. In April a Hong Kong woman named Yuling Luo pleaded guilty to money laundering in connection with the Guangzhou Enterprise. US authorities have reportedly said other suspects remain at large, but have yet to publicly identify them. None of the banks or drug traffickers involved in the scheme have yet to be identified. US authorities may be able to go after suspected Chinese banks if US-based bank branches were involved in any of the alleged financial transactions, said Jodi Avergun, an attorney and former US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) official. As China and Latin America's legal economies become more intertwined, it appears a similar trend is taking place between their criminal underworlds. Chinese mafias have already made their presence felt in Latin America through extortion and human smuggling, while groups like Mexico's Jalisco Cartel - New Generation are moving to exploit China's burgeoning cocaine market. The Guangzhou Enterprise is the latest sign of this trend. ""Criminals exploit whatever vulnerabilities they can,"" Evan Ellis, a research professor of Latin American Studies at the US Army War College, told InSight Crime. ""More trans-Pacific commerce increases not only the flow of goods -- which creates smuggling opportunities -- but builds relationships between people in both legal and illegal activities."" As one example of this, the large number of undocumented Chinese immigrants entering Latin American countries has provided an important source of income for Chinese mafias in the region. Chinese criminal groups can reportedly charge up to $60,000 per person to bring immigrants to countries with Pacific coastlines like Ecuador and Colombia, often the first stop in an undocumented immigrant's long journey to the United States. Alongside these relationships has been an increase in Chinese and Latin American banks opening branches and doing business on both sides of the Pacific in order to finance international contracts and projects. This financial infrastructure can be exploited by money launderers, especially given the lack of coordination between Chinese and Latin American regulators and authorities. ""It's an area that's relatively safer for [criminals] to hide flows of money because there's not as easy visibility,"" Ellis said. Authorities in both China and Latin America are looking to address the issue, but Ellis does not expect trans-Pacific money laundering to end anytime soon. ""It's an emerging trend we're seeing and [that we're] going to see more of in the future,"" he said."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Perus First Lady Escapes Money Laundering Investigation. A judge has called off money laundering investigations into the wife of Peru's President Ollanta Humala, clearing yet another obstacle to the first lady's rise in national politics. On June 9, Peruvian Judge Maria Nino Palomino accepted a writ of habeas corpus submitted by Nadine Heredia -- wife of President Ollanta Humala -- to suspend an investigation into deposits totaling over $216,000 made into her bank accounts between 2005 and 2009, reported El Comercio (see table below, produced by El Comercio). Palomino ruled that the case against Heredia had been resolved in 2010, and that the current investigation violated the principle of ""double jeopardy."" In May, reports began circulating regarding money deposits Heredia's mother, Antonia Alarcon, and close childhood friend, Rocio Calderon Vinatea, received in 2005 from Venezuelan company Inversiones Kaysamak C.A. According to El Comercio , Kaysamak C.A. transferred a total of $87,451 to the two women's bank accounts over the course of the year. Some of this money eventually found its way into Heredia's bank accounts and was used to help finance Humala's unsuccessful 2006 presidential campaign. Heredia's spending of some $38,000 on luxury items , including jewelry and dresses, using a credit card given to her by Rocio Calderon, has also come under scrutiny. In an interview with La Republica , Heredia said that ""about 70 percent"" of the purchases were for Calderon, who gave the credit card to Heredia so she could ""take care of some purchases for her [Calderon]"" during a trip to Europe. Heredia's lawyer, Eduardo Roy Gates, defended the purchases and the 2005 transfers to Alarcon and Calderon from the Venezuelan company, saying the money was not for Heredia but for the formation of the couple's Nationalist Party (PNP) in 2005 (Humala eventually lost the 2006 elections to Alan Garcia). President Humala expressed his indignation at the investigations, calling them ""ridiculous"" and claiming his wife was the target of "" persecution ."" However, Peruvian congressman Yonhy Lescano -- who submitted a motion on June 2 to form a special commission to investigate Heredia and her close associates -- deplored the judge's decision , saying Heredia had joined Peru's ""impunity club."" Peru's first lady has been dogged by allegations of suspicious financial activity and money laundering. Indeed, this is the third time some of the same money laundering accusations against Heredia have been investigated, with Ricardo Rojas reopening investigations in January 2015 into a series of deposits made into her bank accounts. Portions of this money have been linked to Humala's former campaign advisor Martin Belaunde Lossio. Belaunde was recently captured and extradited back to Peru from Bolivia, where he had been hiding after fleeing charges of money laundering and conspiracy. Nonetheless, repeated attempts at prosecuting Heredia on the same charges could suggest a personal attack by her political rivals -- there are many who would benefit from sabotaging her burgeoning political career. Heredia is popular among ordinary Peruvians, and is expected to run for Congress in the 2016 elections. And, at only 39 years old, she is seen as a strong future candidate for president (though, as the wife of the sitting president, she is ineligible to run in 2016). However, the details of the money-laundering allegations against Heredia -- especially regarding the opaque way in which money was transferred between bank accounts -- do raise suspicions about the nature of her activities. These suspicions are fed by Peru's history of high-level politicians and officials being embroiled in corruption scandals and criminal behavior. For instance, in 2014 over 100 political candidates for regional and municipal offices were linked to drug trafficking cases. Former President Alejandro Toledo also faced money laundering and criminal conspiracy allegations. In 2014, President Humala himself was implicated in a campaign financing scandal, being accused of accepting money from Peru's illicit mining sector. He was also accused of links to drug money in 2011. Yet, despite regular evidence of ties between politicians and organized crime , such links often go uninvestigated or unprosecuted by Peru's weak judicial system , resulting in a culture of impunity in Peru. Given the judge's decision regarding Heredia, however, it seems it will remain a mystery whether or not she has joined the ""impunity club."""	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"A Drug Traffickers Journey From a US Prison to Guatemala. A Guatemalan recently accused of laundering money for Honduran criminal network the Valles has a curious backstory: he previously served time in the US, and apparently returned to Guatemala to become a major operator in the cash smuggling trade. Ruben Arita Rivera, a Guatemalan national arrested on March 19 in the southern department of Chiquimula for money laundering, is no novice when it comes to organized crime. Rivera left a US prison four years earlier, after completing a sentence for drug trafficking in New York. Guatemala's Attorney General's Office links him to the seizure of $2.2 million in May 2014, and to a 30-kilo shipment of cocaine seized in the eastern department of Zacapa last February. An unofficial report says that US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents participated in his recent arrest in Guatemala, and that Arita was still on parole when he was captured. Nevertheless, the US Embassy in Guatemala did not confirm this. The US Embassy's spokesperson, Maureen Mimnaugh, said that the United States does not have an extradition request for Arita, according to the DEA office. As of March 19, the United States did not have any pending legal proceedings against Arita, but he is now once again on their radar. This article was originally published in Plaza Publica and was translated, edited, and reprinted with permission. See the Spanish original here. In 2008, Arita and other suspects conspired to distribute 500 grams of cocaine in New York, according to court documents from the Southern District of New York. According to one document, Arita received a package of cocaine in Spring Valley, New York, on March 5, 2008, the day of his capture. Despite the evidence against him, Arita (who hired a public defender) pleaded not guilty. But on January 12, 2009, after an abbreviated judicial procedure, he changed his plea. Ruben Arita Rivera served a prison term in the US before returning to Guatemala The judge Stephen C. Robinson sentenced Arita to 37 months in prison. The time he spent incarcerated while awaiting trial was counted as part of his sentence. He was supposed to leave prison on April 5, 2011, but documents from the Federal Bureau of Prisons show that he was freed on November 10, 2010. He was 44 years old (although Guatemalan police claim that is his current age, as of 2015). The New York court recommended three years of parole, starting when he was released from prison. During his three years on parole, Arita was prohibited from possessing a firearm, and had to provide DNA samples to his parole officer. Other demands required Arita to have a permanent, legal job, and not be in places where illicit drugs were distributed, consumed, used, or sold. He was also prohibited from having relationships with people involved in illegal acts, according to another court document. Almost one and a half years after completing his parole in the US, Arita returned to his criminal past in Guatemala, and is now accused of laundering millions. Arita had to submit his house, car, and workplace to searches if there was ""reasonable suspicion"" that he had violated the terms of his parole. If deported, he could not return to the United States without the authorization of the Attorney General's Office, as is the case with all foreigners who are convicted of drug trafficking. The court ordered Arita to pay the minimum fine of $100, and authorities would exempt him from paying additional fines given his inability to pay (in the end he only paid $25 in additional fees). But almost one and a half years after completing his parole in the US, Arita returned to his criminal past in Guatemala, and is now accused of laundering millions. In 2015, the Public Ministry linked him to money laundering, an activity that allowed him to handle much larger quantities of cash that the $25 he paid to the New York District Court. At least, that is what the Guatemalan prosecutor's office for money laundering believes. The office has linked Arita to the transit of $2.2 million into the hands of Guatemalan national Flavio Dimas Rojas in 2014. He has also been linked to a $360,000 drug shipment, transported by Jose Guillermo Maderos and Carlos Fermin Perez last February. The Charges Against Arita in Guatemala Guatemalan authorities link Arita to the Valle Valle criminal organization in Honduras, which the United States accused of drug trafficking in August 2014. In October, Honduran police captured Jose Reynerio, Miguel Arnulfo and Luis Alonso Valle Valle. Their sister, Digna Azucena, was also arrested for drug trafficking in the United States. According to an unofficial source, the Valles worked with the Lorenzana family, a Guatemalan drug trafficking group, in Zacapa. However, it is unclear what the status of this working relationship was after the capture of three members of both organizations between 2011 and 2013. The Attorney General's Office has tied Arita to an illicit network that moves money from the department of Chiquimula to Huehuetenango and later on to Mexico. This is a noteworthy smuggling route because in 2012, the prosecutor's office for money laundering revealed that cash is moved north to south -- from Mexico to Guatemala -- and eventually on to Panama and Colombia. Arita's network essentially operated in reverse, according to authorities. Nevertheless, there is at least one other case in which this south-to-north money trafficking route has been observed -- however, it does not end in Mexico, but in the United States. This case also involved a Guatemalan national. Between 2003 and 2007, a prosecutor in Florida documented how a network co-led by Otto Roberto Herrera Garcia collected cash in Mexico (for the Sinaloa Cartel) and sent it via currency exchange offices to a bank in Florida and a Bank of America in Oklahoma City. The goal: buy planes in the United States, send them to Colombia and Venezuela, and use them to ship cocaine to Guatemala and Mexico. Similarly to Arica, Guatemala capo Otto Herrera Garcia was also involved in a large money-smuggling network There are still suspicions that the $14 million found in April 2003 -- in a house that Herrera was renting in Guatemala City -- was supposed to be sent to Mexico, not to South America, as authorities believed at the time. There is no public information on where the cash Arita managed was ultimately supposed to end up, but there are similarities between his case and Herrera's. The Town of Chanmagua Under the Spotlight Police officials captured Arita in the town of Chanmagua, in the department of Chiquimula, close to the border with Honduras. It is not a place that is frequently mentioned in the press. It appeared in a few media reports in November 2012, when police seized a contraband cigarette shipment in the area. That same year, an ex-police officer and private investigator revealed that the town was a sales point for contraband firearms, especially assault rifles that arrived from Mexico via Belize. The red point shows where Arita was arrested in Guatemala In addition, on January 24, 2012, Guatemalan newspaper Siglo XXI described Chanmagua as a ""place for weapons and drug trafficking."" The newspaper also reported a multiple homicide case had taken place there, citing witnesses who said that six heavily-armed assassins burned a vehicle with Honduran license plates in Chanmagua, and later moved the dead bodies to Honduras. The testimonies state that police who arrived at the scene found only the scorched vehicle. Later, the Ministry of the Interior indicated that it found no evidence an assasination had taken place there. The murders reportedly occurred on the road headed towards Chanmagua, which eventually takes you to San Fernando Ocotepeque, a border crossing in Honduras. If Arita is an associate of the Valle Valles -- in addition to allegedly being involved in money laundering and drug trafficking -- it is unsurpising that authorities captured him in Chanmagua, according to the Attorney General's Office. An unofficial source affirmed that, despite recent arrests, the Valle Valles are still actively trafficking cocaine with their Guatemalan partners. Now, whether Arita will receive the same benevolence in Guatemala as he did in New York depends on whether or not the authorities are able to prove the charges against him. *This article was originally published in Plaza Publica and was translated, edited, and reprinted with permission.

Conviction Overturned in Zetas US Horse Racing Case. A US appeals court has overturned a conviction and ordered a retrial for US citizens accused of laundering drug profits for Mexico's Zetas through racehorses, in a case that illustrates the challenges in breaking down transnational money laundering networks. A three-judge panel at a Federal Appeals Court in New Orleans has overturned the money laundering conviction of horse trainer Eusevio Maldonado Huitron, stating that prosecutors failed to demonstrate his intentional involvement in illegal activities. While the judges did not dispute that the horse stables where Maldonado worked were used to launder money for Mexico's Zetas cartel, they argued that there was no evidence to indicate Maldonado had taken part in anything but training the horses bought with drug money. The ruling also called for a retrial in the case of Francisco Colorado Cessa, who prosecutors alleged had founded a company with a loan from a Zetas member and purchased horses on behalf of the cartel with illicit funds. The judges made the decision based on the instructions given to the jury by the trial judge, who told them they must consider the defendant guilty of money laundering if they believed there was a commingling of legal money from his business with illegal funds. However, the new ruling states, this is incorrect, and the jury should have been instructed that although they could come to that conclusion, they could also decide otherwise -- that the mixing of legal and illegal revenues was not a deliberate attempt to launder money. The convictions of the two other men involved in the trial, Fernando Garcia Solis and Jose Trevino Morales , the brother of Zetas leaders Z40 and Z42, were upheld. The story of how the Zetas infiltrated the world of US horse racing to launder their drug trade profits has become one of the most infamous cases exposing the US business interests of Mexican cartels. However, with this latest ruling, it is now also an example of just how difficult it is to prosecute money laundering cases. Even after prosecutors had firmly established that the business was used to disguise criminal profits, proving that all of the front men involved were aware of its illegal purpose has proved much more complicated. Tackling organized crime by going after its financial assets can be one of the most effective ways of targeting networks, as it hits crime bosses where it hurts them most -- in their pockets. However, unpicking criminal business interests from legal ones is a long, complicated process that, as in this case, can be derailed by uncertainties.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"$5 Bn Money Laundering Bust Puts Brazil Under Spotlight. A coordinated wave of police raids in Brazil dismantled a ring alleged to have laundered nearly five billion dollars -- stark evidence that huge quantities of criminal money is flowing through one of the world's largest economies. More than 400 police searched 81 different properties and served more than a dozen arrest warrants in 17 different Brazilian cities, according to business newspaper Valor Economico. Among those arrested was the owner of one of the largest gas stations in the federal capital of Brasilia, according to news agency EBC. According to police, several main players behind black-market money exchanges in Brazil were also part of the ring. The ring is alleged to have laundered about 10 billion reais, approximately $4.3 billion, for individuals and companies involved in drug trafficking, tax evasion, gemstone smuggling, illegal mining and other crimes. The operation was entitled, Lavo Jato, or Jet Wash, because the money-laundering scheme used a number of gas stations and dry cleaners to ""wash"" the criminal money. According to Folha De S. Paulo , the operation was linked to the arrest of Andre Santos, a businessman caught last December with nearly $300,000 in his socks at the Brasilia airport. Santos is accused of being the financial arm of a Lebanese gang that smuggled illegal goods from Paraguay. The enormous amount of money that passed through this money-laundering scheme underscores the fact that Brazil, the world's seventh largest economy, is clearly struggling to combat financial crimes. According to one 2008 estimate, official corruption is responsible for up to 70 percent of the money laundered in Brazil. And just last February, InSight Crime media partner Publica outlined how a Brazilian businessman in Florida allegedly laundered money for Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. According to the State Department's annual drug report, it is difficult to determine comprehensive numbers on money laundering patterns in Brazil because the country does not keep records on convictions or arrests. The State Department report named Sao Paulo, Brazil and surrounding parts of Argentina and Paraguay as areas that possess ""high risk factors"" for money laundering because smuggling is rampant -- not only of drugs and weapons but also CDs, DVDs and illegal computer software. The report details that high-priced goods are often paid for in US dollars and then the money is smuggled from Paraguay into Brazil, where it can eventually make its way into US banking systems. At least part of that scheme appears to have been replicated in this money laundering case."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Mexico Presidents Campaign Funds Tied to Suspicious Ring: Reforma. Mexico's Attorney General's Office has newly opened investigations into allegations that President Enrique Pena Nieto accepted funds from a possible money laundering and financial fraud network during his presidential campaign, a case which, if unraveled, would represent a major step forward for the justice system. According to Reforma , approximately $1.75 million were received by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate in 2012 from various ""virtual"" companies linked to the construction company Edicom that are under investigation for suspicious financial transactions. Two key suspects in the case, Raul Alvarez Longoria and Ricardo Mauro Calzada Cisneros, funneled $773,000 and $993,000, respectively, via electronic cards issued by financial group Monex, to the PRI, according to Reforma. The two men have been tied to each other through money deposited into an HSBC bank account. In July last year, the runner-up in Mexico's elections, Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, alleged that Pena Nieto benefitted from funds of illicit origin during his campaign. The case centered on the Monex cards, and the finding that two companies that, according to invoices, purchased large amounts of these cards appeared to be nonexistent. The opposition National Action Party (PAN) also accused the PRI of using the Monex cards to buy votes, but the charges were dropped after it was found that Edicom was also linked to the campaign money of PAN candidate Josefina Vazquez Mota. The pursuit of a case that involves the current president could represent an important step in Mexico, where corrupt politicians with organized crime ties are common and money laundering prosecutions are rare. A lack of political will often hinders progress in money laundering cases, and this is a particular risk when the target is the president himself. The case also shows how politics in Mexico are often tied into corruption cases, with accusations hurled from all sides, as seen in a case against a Tamaulipas governor. Exposing a politician's dirty money is a prime way to ruin his credibility, and using information to buy influence, jobs and political favors is a Mexican political mainstay. Ultimately, the case will serve as an important test of whether the country's Attorney General's Office is able to carry out a fully independent, fair investigation, free of political pressures."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Peru Breaks Up Colombia Money Laundering Ring. Peruvian authorities have dismantled a Colombian money laundering network that allegedly moved $10 million per month through illegal loans, raising the question of why Colombians have chosen to use Peru to run these types of criminal operations. A Peruvian woman and 16 Colombians operating in Lima, Huancayo and Iquitos were arrested, and three buildings, ten vehicles, firearms, money and computers confiscated from the group, reported La Republica. According to Public Ministry officials, the group used social networking sites to launder funds of illicit origin by offering immediate loans of up to $25,000 with no guarantee. After granting the loan, the network charged monthly interest rates of between 40 to 60 percent and in some cases kidnapped debtors who defaulted, forcing their family members to sell off whatever they could in order to pay back the loan. According to news site Peru.com , the Huancayo-based members were called ""Los Armenios de Colombia"" (the Armenians of Colombia) and simultaneously worked selling fruit and pastries. Peru's apparently lax money laundering controls may help to explain why a Colombian gang chose to use the country as its operational base. Despite the implementation of a national plan to combat money laundering , the government reported in 2012 that the country had not achieved any convictions for money laundering , and that of around 120 cases investigated, only four had resulted in judicial proceedings. In June, Peruvian authorities reported a rise in money laundering through small businesses , with official data indicating that 3.5 percent of annual GDP may be the product of illicit funds. Police corruption exacerbates the situation -- as of June, 900 police were under investigation in Peru for complicity in crimes including money laundering and kidnapping. One interesting question is how the Colombians were able to operate without being pushed out by Peruvian gangs. The majority of Peruvian gang members -- over 12,000 of 13,000 -- are believed to be concentrated in Lima , according to one report, possibly leaving the Huancayo and Iquitos markets open for control. The case illustrates how the internet helps to facilitate illicit financial activities, providing a largely unregulated platform for the transfer of funds, and provides an example of the increasingly diverse ways organized criminals are using social media, a topic examined by InSight Crime last month ."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"US Blacklists Colombia Money Launderers with Israel Connections. The United States Treasury Department has placed 31 individuals and entities on its ""Kingpin List"" for participation in a Colombia-based money laundering network with connections to Israel and bank accounts in China, illustrating the highly globalized nature of Latin American financial crime. Colombian national Isaac Perez Guberek Ravinovicz and his son Henry Guberek Grimberg, a dual Israeli and Colombian national, were placed on the US Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers (SDNT) list -- or ""Kingpin List"" -- for allegedly leading a Bogota-based network responsible for laundering hundreds of millions of dollars for numerous drug trafficking organizations. Four of the men's family members -- one of whom lives in Israel -- and three Colombian business associates were also blacklisted for aiding the operation. [See Treasury's organizational chart below.] According to the US Treasury, the father and son used legitimate textile companies based out of Colombia, in addition to various shell companies in Panama and one in Israel, to engage in money laundering, with drug traffickers transferring funds from all over the world into the bank accounts of these front businesses. In addition to Colombia, the network held bank accounts in China, Hong Kong, Israel, Spain, the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and the Cayman Islands. The US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida also announced the separate filing of charges against four Colombians in relation to the same case, including the two Gubereks, their secretary -- also on the Treasury list -- and a man who was linked in 2012 to an illegal money transport network operating in Panama. The sheer number of countries in which the network had bank accounts, in addition to the group's international business connections, highlights the extent to which financial crime has become a transnational business. Other recent Colombian cases have shown similar tendencies. A 2011 law enforcement operation uncovered a 22-person international network that laundered money for the Medellin-based Oficina de Envigado, and in 2013, US authorities dismantled a Colombian money laundering network with US and Dominican members. The use of Panama also remains a mainstay in this side of the business. The country has previously hosted another operation to make it on the SDNT list , which had links to Colombia and Hong Kong. The global nature of the money laundering problem was recently recognized by the G8 countries, which agreed to require greater financial transparency from companies , in particular the sort of shell companies allegedly used by the Gubereks."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Argentine Soccer at Center of Major Money Laundering Network. A coordinated ""mega-wave"" of raids has exposed an alleged major money laundering and tax evasion scheme involving soccer clubs in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile. Around 150 simultaneous raids last week targeted offices of major clubs and players' representatives and homes of club officials in Argentina and the offices of four major financial institutions, including the Royal Bank of Canada, in Uruguay. Judicial sources told newspaper La Nacion that the raids uncovered the ""central office"" for money laundering in Argentine soccer, alleged to have handled transfers worth tens of millions of dollars in recent years. According to La Nacion, the offices belong to Alhec Group, a finance company which operates in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay and has handled many sales of Argentine players to foreign clubs. Ten people were arrested in Argentina, including two public officials, one of whom was the Inspector General of Currency Control. The use of soccer clubs for money laundering is a decades-old phenomenon in Latin America, coming to particular prominence in Colombia during the 1980s, when major drug traffickers openly bought up their local teams and played out their rivalries on the field. More recently, an investigation into the finances of Bogota club Santa Fe led investigators to Luis Agustin Caicedo Velandia, alias ""Don Lucho,"" a major drug trafficker previously living incognito in Buenos Aires, where he was arrested in 2010. It has since been suggested that, alongside the Alvarez Meyendorff brothers, Don Lucho laundered up to $1.5 billion through Colombian soccer clubs. Last week's operation appears to be the culmination of a long-running investigation by Argentina's tax revenue office, which last year saw Argentine soccer player Jonathan Bottinelli charged with tax evasion following a suspicious transfer to another team. More than 140 soccer agents have been suspended, and Alhec Group has been under investigation since last March. What has not yet been revealed is the exact volume of money concerned. The Bottinelli transfer involved a deposit of $1.7 million into a Miami bank, but the fees for some of the other transfers under investigation have been more than ten times that amount."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Nicaragua to Try Fake Mexican Journalists for Money Laundering. A judge in Nicaragua announced that the 18 Mexican nationals arrested last month while posing as Televisa journalists and carrying over $9 million, will be put on trial for money laundering and drug trafficking. Nicaragua's Attorney General's Office has accused the 18 Mexicans arrested last month while posing as Televisa journalists of being a ""highly organized"" criminal group dedicated to transporting ""large quantities"" of drugs between Mexico and Costa Rica. A Nicaraguan judge ordered that a public oral trial of the accused will commence on December 3. The group was detained on August 20 at a security checkpoint on the border between Nicaragua and Honduras. Although the group tried to pass themselves off as reporters for Televisa, a Mexican media company, police discovered $9.2 million in cash and traces of cocaine in the caravan's vehicles. The Attorney General's Office reported that the six vans that the group traveled in were fully equipped with television equipment and had Televisa logos , although Televisa has reported having no connection to the group. The group's legal team maintains that the only crime the group committed was not declaring the cash to customs and that there is no evidence that the money was obtained through, or destined for illicit purposes. However, according to a report by Costa Rica news station Channel 6, the fake journalists reportedly made some 190 trips into Costa Rica, although the report did not specify over which period of time. The group apparently entered the country through the San Jose International Airport and via a border crossing with Nicaragua. At least one Costa Rican immigration official is under investigation for allegedly selling false passports to members of the group. While the police have not released the names of all of the detained, authorities have indicated that some of the accused are employees or ex-employees of private security companies in Tamaulipas , while others may be current or former municipal police in Durango. Nicaraguan authorities have not yet ruled out links between the group and the criminal organization that was involved with the murder of Argentinian folk singer Facundo Cabral in Guatemala in 2011. At the time of their arrest, several members of the group were allegedly linked to Los Charros , a Mexican criminal network with ties to Henry Farinas, the Nicaraguan businessman who is currently on trial for drug trafficking and money laundering and who survived the attack that killed Cabral."	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
Mexico Cartels Stealing Gold to Launder Drug Money. Mexican authorities say that, since 2008, criminal gangs have robbed so many trucks carrying gold shipments that some mining companies have been forced to switch to aerial transportation. This highlights the convenience of gold as a means to launder dirty cash. Drug cartels primarily use the gold to launder their proceeds, usually reworking it into jewelery and selling it on the legal market, reports Excelsior. Theft of gold bar shipments has been reported in some of the states most affected by drug violence, including Chihuahua, Sonora, and Durango. One miners' association in Sonora told the newspaper that their production costs have increased 15 percent due to security problems, and because they are forced to move their product mostly by plane. The report does not provide a total for the number of such robberies registered in the past four years, but says the gold stolen during that period is worth some $3 million. The Attorney General's Office reportedly has seven open investigations into gold robberies, all of which involve drug trafficking groups. Some organizations even have the technology to melt down the stolen gold and recast it into bars with a higher level of purity, the report reveals. Gold has various advantages that are appealing to money launderers, including its easy convertibility, and the fact that it can be transferred with relative anonymity on the world market. Both Colombia's Cali and Medellin Cartels favored gold as a way to launder the proceeds of drug trafficking. It is typically used a means to transfer money from drug sales in the US back to the cartel's country of origin. There are a couple of ways such laundering schemes could work. One is buying gold with dirty cash, and reworking the metal so that it is disguised as a common household or fashion item, then exporting this back to the drug cartel's home country, refining it, and selling it for cash. Another method involves exchanging cash for gold, and using the gold itself to represent the proceeds gained from drug trafficking. A popular method used by the Medellin Cartel involved importing bars of gold mixed with lead, which were reported as fine gold. By overcharging for the low-purity gold and fudging the invoices, the cartel was able to disguise its profits. It is likely that the Mexican cartels are also employing a wide variety of ways to use gold to launder proceeds from organized crime. The fact that the Mexican groups have elected to steal the gold outright, rather than purchasing it from legitimate jewelry sellers as the Colombian cartels used to , is one sign of the boldness of the Mexican criminal syndicates. It could also be that stealing gold shipments is viewed as easier and more convenient than going through the hassle of building a relationship with a supplier, which could explain why some Mexican groups have elected to use theft as their primary means of obtaining gold. 	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Jamaica Seizes Over $8M in Assets, Looks to Expand Money Laundering Law. Jamaica has frozen more than $8 million in assets, some belonging to alleged drug traffickers, as the country rolls out legislation to target illicitly obtained funds and money laundering. The seizures, a result of 14 orders obtained last year by the country's Financial Investigations Division (FID), came under the Proceeds of Crime Act ( POCA ) that was enacted in 2007 and gives the state powers to seize property and finances obtained through drug trafficking and/or money laundering. Three of the 14 cases alone accounted for close to $6 million, according to the Jamaican newspaper Gleaner. Assets seized included vehicles, real estate, bank accounts and jewellery. Among those targeted were white-collar workers, alleged drug traffickers living overseas, and people involved in a lottery scam. The head of FID, Albert Stephens, told the Gleaner that in addition to these assets, the agency seized more than $1.5 million in cash in 2011. The announcement of these successes came soon after Jamaica's national security minister, Peter Bunting, stated that legislation is being advanced to expand the act's remit to give agencies the ability to seize assets of those complicit in illicit activity and who actively facilitate it. The Jamaican Observer comments that this expansion is ""long overdue,"" pointing to the fact that high-level criminals have been increasingly turning to professionals well versed in this area of the law to hide their illicit assets from law enforcement agencies. Jamaica was listed as a country of ""concern"" on the US State Department's most recent annual report on money laundering and financial crimes. The island's banks are used by transnational criminal organizations, particularly Colombian, to channel illicit funds due to their comparatively weak regulation, according to the CIA's World Factbook.

"Small Success Shows Bigger Failure to Stop US-Mexico Cash Smuggling. U.S. authorities celebrated the confiscation of more than a million dollars in cash along the Mexican border, unwittingly illustrating the overall failure to stop billions of dollars in drug money that flow south into Mexico each year. Custom officials made the first seizure Friday, when a Mitsubishi SUV was discovered with $600,000 in the spare tire while waiting to cross the border from Laredo, Texas. A day later, authorities in Eagle Pass, Texas, found almost $550,000 beneath the seat of a Mazda trying to drive into Mexico, Excelsior reports. ""This is the largest seizure of outbound currency in the history of Eagle Pass Port of Entry,"" said customs director Cynthia O. Rodriguez. Rodriguez's comment unintentionally illustrates the general failure of U.S. and Mexican efforts to stop the southward flow of drug profits. According to the Washington Post , American officials grabbed just $85 million in illicit cash at the border in 2009. This is overshadowed by the $18-$39 billion in drug profits that the U.S. government estimates to cross the border each year. The figure appears to conflate cash shipments with other forms of money transfer, but even the lower end of the range would mean that U.S. authorities' cash seizures are a fraction of a percent of the total. The authorities are hailing the seizure of $1.15 million in illicit cash over two days as a success. But even if the pace was maintained for an entire year, and the government managed to confiscate $209 million, this would still be only a small fraction of the total estimated flow. This lack of effectiveness reflects the difficulty of spotting cash shipments. Hundreds of thousands of cars cross the U.S. border with Mexico every day, and a thorough inspection of them all is not feasible. A million dollars in one hundred dollar bills occupies a space not much larger than a shoebox, so authorities are in search of the proverbial needle in the haystack. Once cash makes it over the border into Mexico, drug trafficking organizations have to launder it. Here the authorities also fail; Mexican prosecutors secured just 37 convictions on money-laundering charges from 2008 through mid-2010, according to the Associated Press. This is despite the fact that in many cities it is common knowledge which businesses are connected to organized crime. An asset-seizure law passed in 2009 was supposed to be an enormous step forward in the fight against money laundering. However, not a single case has been brought using the law in its two years of existence. The problem with the law, according to the AP, is that it requires prosecutors to divulge the entire scope of their evidence against a suspect when seeking the seizure of an asset. This can throw future criminal prosecutions into jeopardy, a risk many are unwilling to take. Mexico has also enacted stronger restrictions on dollar deposits in banks, which makes it more difficult to process drug money smuggled over the border. However, with the nation's economy heavily based on cash, it is difficult to enact regulations strict enough to significantly limit the flow of dirty money. A robust money-laundering effort would also depend on the participation of the banks where capos keep their money. However, banks have a strong financial incentive to avoid asking tough questions of people who do business with them. Consequently, they often don't. U.S. bank Wachovia's lax monitoring of $378.4 billion in cash transfers over several years illustrates this problem, as detailed in an investigation by British newspaper The Observer. As a result, the bank failed to identify the cash used to purchase of 22 tons of cocaine. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

"Suspicious Venezuela Shipwreck Reveals Drug Route to Dutch Caribbean. The sinking of a small boat heading from Venezuela to Curacao and the disappearance of all the migrants aboard suggest that drug trafficking groups are also controlling human smuggling routes in the region. On June 7, the group of 32 migrants, along with three crew members, set sail from Punta de Aguide in Venezuela's Falcon state, on the Caribbean coast. On June 11, the boat was was declared missing, and a month later, the whereabouts of it and its passengers remain unknown. The disappearance was reported as a shipwreck , an increasingly common disaster in the Caribbean as Venezuelans resort to desperate measures to flee the country. So far this year, three shipwrecks involving over 80 migrants have been reported. After the latest shipwreck, family members reported that all the migrants had been wearing life-jackets. Yet only one body has been recovered to date -- that of Elio Ramones , identified in Curacao on June 12. To the surprise of authorities, his corpse seemed fresh, suggesting that the man had died several days after the supposed shipwreck. Oswaldo Rodriguez Leon, Falcon's security secretary who is coordinating the search for the missing, said that ""it is not possible for no trace to be found of the 32 people who disappeared in that shipwreck; the bodies should be floating if they were drowned. We must investigate [the fact] that pirates could have taken them."" On July 11, two men were arrested for recruiting the migrants in their hometown of Vela de Coro, along Venezuela's northern coast. But the arrests have brought authorities no closer to finding the disappeared. In June, survivors of a previous shipwreck exposed a human trafficking route used to transport vulnerable women and children from Venezuela to Trinidad and Tobago, where they were sold into the sex trade. After the latest shipwreck, residents in Falcon told InSight Crime that human smuggling is used as a front for drug shipments to the Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao, which are between 15 to 50 miles off the coast of Venezuela. According to local sources, both cocaine and marijuana arrive overland and are stored in huts along the beaches of Falcon. It is then loaded onto small boats by night and shipped to neighboring islands under the guise of migrant transports, in quantities of up to 8,000 kilograms per day. Although not officially corroborated, the locals' claims are supported by recent large drug seizures on the Lara-Falcon highway, headed for the Falcon coast. Migrants are lured into the scheme by the low rates charged. The 32 missing people had reportedly paid $400 for the journey, compared to the standard rate of between $650 and $700. In Vela de Coro, InSight Crime spoke to three families whose loved ones were aboard the shipwrecked boat and who are now missing. They said that following the disappearance they have begun their own investigations, including making inquiries with relatives on Curacao. They claim that the missing boat was carrying a drug shipment to Curacao and that the shipment did arrive, but 500 kilograms lighter than expected, giving rise to their belief that the migrants were kidnapped because the captain did not deliver the full drug shipment. The families have also begun searching hills near Punta de Aguide, where they believe the migrants were held before boarding the boats. Helicopters, however, are needed to comb over the mountainous territory largely controlled by drug traffickers. Relatives of the missing migrants point to the inadequate official response as evidence of criminal complicity. Although the authorities were notified within a day of the disappearance, a search was not initiated until June 11, four days later. Furthermore, authorities are alleged to have known of the voyage before the boat set sail. The family members who spoke with InSight Crime said that the migrants had intended to depart on June 6, but were intercepted by officials from the country's criminal investigation unit (Cuerpo de Investigaciones Cientificas, Penales y Criminalisticas - CICPC) who stole some of their belongings, including mobile phones, and took $1,000 from the captain. The migrants spent the night hiding in the woods before setting sail the following evening. CICPC officials have also allegedly been involved in previous cases of predation on migrants, including the sex trafficking route to Trinidad and Tobago exposed in June. This is not the first boatload of Venezuelan migrants to disappear. A boat vanished on May 16 in route to Trinidad and Tobago , and no corpses, wreckage or surviving passengers have been found."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Prostitution Ring Highlights Vulnerability of Colombia Indigenous Communities. Authorities in Colombia have broken up a prostitution ring exploiting indigenous minors in the Amazonas department, the second human trafficking ring arrested this year in the region. On July 31, police arrested 13 suspected participants in a criminal network, including three members of local indigenous communities, which recruited indigenous girls for prostitution, according to a police statement. The prostitution ring was based in Leticia, Amazonas, a city located in the area where Colombia, Peru, and Brazil meet. In the city, the group allegedly used motorcycle taxis to prowl schools in search of girls, who were then transported to Brazil and Peru, where they were forced into sex work. The police say the traffickers charged between 200,000 and 300,000 Colombian pesos (between $61 and $92) per victim as a trafficking fee. This is the second human trafficking ring that Colombian police have dismantled in the area in the last six months. In February, authorities took down a criminal network, which recruited indigenous girls in Puerto Narino, Amazonas, on the border with Brazil. The girls were then coerced into sexual and labor exploitation in nearby cities in Peru. The targeting of minors by prostitution rings is just one example of how indigenous communities throughout Colombia remain exceedingly vulnerable to criminal activity. Often, indigenous populations live in remote parts of the country where access to state services is minimal. A culture of government neglect has further marginalized these communities, leaving them exposed to various criminal threats and intensifying their distrust of state security forces. In addition, the country's armed groups repeatedly encroach on indigenous land, often in resource-rich rural areas. In May 2019, for example, a Colombian armed group, known as Aguilas Negras, or Black Eagles, declared as a military objective an indigenous community in the western department of Narino, due to its wealth of natural resources and adequate climate for growing illicit crops. In other cases, indigenous communities are caught in the crossfire as armed groups vie for control of coca production in areas where the state has minimal influence. The arrests in Leticia come against the backdrop of mounting aggression towards indigenous leaders nationwide. Between January 2018 and April 2019, 74 indigenous leaders were killed , according to figures from Colombia's forensic institute, Medicina Legal.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Colombias Bogota-Medellin Highway Rife With Child Sex Exploitation. The highway between Bogota and Medellin is one of Colombia's worst sites for child sex trafficking and exploitation, as criminal groups abuse underage, underprivileged girls who are now being encouraged to fight back by going to the authorities. Girls between 12 and 15 years old, usually from very poor families, have been forced to offer sexual services to drivers passing through the service station known as Caracoli, located between the municipalities of Honda and La Dorada, as was first reported by El Pais. This service station is just a few meters away from a police station, yet it's one of the focal points of a network of pimps and motel operators working along this crucial road. A number of organizations assisting survivors to file reports with authorities told InSight Crime that at least 39 underage girls were sexually exploited around the Caracoli service station. Through long investigations, involving wiretaps and intercepting phone calls, authorities have managed to identify some of the sex traffickers and the modus operandi of these networks. The usual method is that potential clients are approached and offered a catalog bearing the photos of the children, one investigator who asked to remain anonymous told InSight Crime. Once a price has been agreed to, ""they call the chosen girl and take her to the indicated site, whether it is a motel or private residence,"" the source added. This type of sexual exploitation operation, showing a catalog instead of having the girls present, is also known to exist in Medellin. However, other girls reported having been coerced by their families. One 14-year-old girl identified as Patricia told El Pais that her aunt first took her to Caracoli and offered her directly to truck drivers for 20,000 Colombian pesos (around $6). In March 2019, prosecutors dismantled one sex trafficking ring which forcibly recruited girls around the town of Guaduas, 60 kilometers away from La Dorada and the highway, according to judicial sources consulted by InSight Crime. The girls are now fighting back. An increasing number of them are filing complaints with authorities with the assistance of organizations such as Todas con las Mujeres. Colombia is known as a destination for child sex trafficking. More than 100 cases of child sexual exploitation were filed with authorities every month between January 2013 and July 2018. And the figure is rising, with the number of reported cases having tripled in the last five years. Yet the conviction rate has been abysmal. Of 85,000 investigations into claims of child sex abuse between 2005 and 2018, only 6,116 ended in a conviction. To date, no arrests have been made related to complaints filed by the survivors of the crime networks operating on the Bogota-Medellin highway. Despite wider investigations into sex trafficking in Colombia, this lack of a response for the ""girls of Caracoli,"" as investigators refer to them, has shown the lack of protection being offered to these girls and to other potential targets, leaving them as easy prey for criminal groups. Most of these cases have been filed in Bogota and Medellin, considered to be major centers for sex tourism and child exploitation. The case of the girls of Caracoli has also shown how child sex trafficking rings have extended their reach to other highways across the country, where they allegedly act with impunity due to a lack of state controls in service stations and other facilities. Due to fears about obstruction of justice related to the case, their complaints are now being overseen in Bogota by Mario Gomez Jimenez, Colombia's special prosecutor for crimes against children and adolescents, who is in charge of the investigation. Access to justice has historically been limited for the victims of child sex trafficking, who often do not file complaints. Authorities say that this has meant they do not have a full understanding of how many children have been abused in the country. Gomez Jimenez told InSight Crime in an interview that many girls also do not want to participate in witness protection programs as they fear they could be taken far away from their families and homes. The girls also refrain from speaking out for fear criminal gangs will target their families in retaliation, he explained. This vulnerability has also seen many girls seek protection from different criminal groups or abusers, who may pledge more protection or only a certain type of client. Members of Todas con las Mujeres, who have followed the girls of Caracoli for the last year to assist and document their lives, told InSight Crime that many of these children are no longer at Caracoli, but that they are sexually exploited at other points along the Bogota-Medellin highway."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Bahamas Gets US Help to Combat Human Trafficking. The United States and the Bahamas have signed an agreement to facilitate combating transnational criminal activity on the islands, including the horrific crime of human trafficking. On April 27, Lisa Johnson, US Charge d'Affaires, and Fred Mitchell, Bahamian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Immigration, formally signed the Seventh Amendment to the Letter of Agreement on Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, reported Tribune242. The amendment will result in Nassau receiving $2.74 million, which Johnson explained is meant to help ""enhance the capabilities of the Royal Bahamas Police Force support drug demand reduction and to increase the Bahamas' capability to investigate and prosecute crime."" Mitchell called the significance of the new amendment ""irrefutable,"" saying it will help protect ""our borders from the pernicious threats of money laundering, human trafficking, and the smuggling of illicit drugs and firearms."" Human trafficking -- often identified as the world's second most profitable crime -- as been of increasing concern in the Bahamas in recent years. The State Department's 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP) described the country as a ""destination, source, and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking."" Migrant workers from Haiti were identified as especially vulnerable to involuntary servitude. Although migrants from China, Jamaica, and the Philippines also reportedly arrived to the Caribbean nation against their will. The TIP Report also says the Bahamas does not fully comply with minimum standards to address the problem, but it is making significant efforts to do so; noting how in March 2014 the country had its first conviction ever for human trafficking. Other Caribbean nations are also on the US watch list for human trafficking. The Dominican Republic has especially been seen as a transit and source country for migrants, with human smuggling networks having been identified moving Dominican migrants into South America and Cubans into Puerto Rico. Haiti is another significant source of forced labor , and the 2014 Global Slavery Index labeled it as having the highest percentage of its population living in slave-like conditions in the region."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
Colombia Dismantles Child Sex Ring Allegedly Tied to Beauty Queen. Authorities in Colombia have dismantled three child prostitution rings -- including one allegedly involving a beauty queen -- highlighting a widespread problem with child sex tourism and the links between the networks involved. In simultaneous operations on October 12, US and Colombian authorities dismantled child prostitution networks in the cities of Cartagena, Medellin, and Armenia, reported El Tiempo. According to Semana , five alleged members of the Cartagena ring -- including local beauty queen and model Kelly Johana Suarez Moya -- were captured while they hosted a party for sex tourists on an island near the city. The victims included 25 minors between the ages of 13 and 17, who told authorities they had been tricked into attending the party. Suarez is accused of recruiting the minors through social media under the guise of a modeling agency. In Medellin, four individuals were arrested when they attempted to offer child prostitutes to undercover US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents posing as sex tourists. According to El Tiempo, many of the victims of the ring were reportedly drugged with the synthetic drug 2CB. Investigations revealed ties between prostitution networks in Cartagena and other parts of the country, reported El Heraldo. According to El Tiempo, the prostitution ring dismantled in Armenia was linked to networks that trafficked children from the coffee region (where Armenia is located) to cities on the Atlantic Coast. In addition to illustrating the tactics employed by child prostitution rings, the recent captures indicate how networks in different regions of Colombia can be interconnected. As illustrated by the case in Medellin, in which a taxi driver helped recruit girls, these rings are often shielded and facilitated by legitimate businesses linked to tourism. Hotels are another major culprit in this regard. Child prostitution is a major problem in Colombia, where, according to 2011 estimates , some 35,000 minors are victims of sexual exploitation. The problem is fueled by sex tourism, especially in tourist hubs like Cartagena where a large number of impoverished children are coerced or forced into prostitution. Medellin is another child prostitution hub , with young girls in some cases exploited by gangs and sold into the sex trade. Some of these girls are even auctioned off to sex tourists who bid on their virginity.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Ecuador Tackles Loan Sharking that Funds Human Smuggling. Ecuador has increased the legal penalties for loan sharks in an attempt to crack down on the exploitation that is a key part of the human smuggling and trafficking chain. Unscrupulous lenders who charge more than the legal amount of interest will now face jail sentences of five to seven years and fines of up to 200 times the minimum wage ($318 a month), compared to the current punishments of six months to two years in jail and fines between $16 and $311 dollars, reported El Comercio. Those who lend money to five or more people will face even stiffer penalties -- between seven and ten years in jail and fines of up to 500 times the minimum wage. In one illustrative case, the newspaper spoke to a 67-year-old woman who had borrowed $16,000 from a loan shark to pay for her daughter's passage to the United States in 2008, money that was paid directly to a ""coyote"" -- criminals who coordinate the transport of illegal immigrants traveling across Latin America towards and over the US border. The woman, who was illiterate, signed documents offering her house as collateral. Despite paying back $1,000 a month the debt -- for which the interest increased by 3 percent each month -- rose to more than $40,000 and her house is now set to be repossessed on December 20. Between January 2012 and July 2013, 396 cases of usury (lending money with excessive interest rates) were reported across Ecuador, according to figures from the Prosecutor General. The increased penalties are part of Ecuador's new Penal Code, the majority of which was approved earlier this month. Exorbitant, unethical debt is the bedrock of human smuggling and human trafficking, the key to what makes it such a hugely profitable criminal enterprise. At the beginning of the chain desperate people borrow money to pay excessive transport fees for themselves or relatives. Along the way migrants are often held captive until further amounts are paid, with deadly consequences for those unable to scrape together the cash. Once in the United States, many migrants are then sold into forms of debt bondage such as forced labor or prostitution. Effectively cracking down on loan sharks could alleviate some of the distress caused to the families left behind, but given the law will still allow for the borrowing, just at fairer interest rates, it is unlikely to make an impact on the wider net of ruthless exploitation behind human trafficking and smuggling."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"20,000 Migrants Kidnapped per year in Mexico. Twenty thousand migrants per year are kidnapped in Mexico by criminal groups, ElSalvador.com says , citing Mexican and international monitoring organizations. The startling number appears just days after 72 migrants were found shot and killed execution style in the Tamaulipas state in northern Mexico. Many of these migrants ride the so-called ""train of death"" to reach the border. As this CNN report makes clear, it is a treacherous trip. "	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Suspected Human Smugglers Found Dead. Mexican authorities found three dead bodies of men they said were members of the group that killed 72 migrants in Tamaulipas last month, La Cronica reported. One of the witnesses, a Honduran migrant who escaped, identified the men. They were found along the side of the road near where the massacre happened after members of the Mexican Navy received an anonymous phone tip. The army killed three other alleged members of the gang that killed the migrants, and another was captured. The Zetas drug trafficking organization are said to be responsible for the massacre. The gang has branched into human trafficking in recent years, which the United Nations estimates is a $7 billion per year business. 	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
"Honduras Extortionists are Targeting Bigger Companies. Honduras' private sector is calling for police to step up action against extortion in response to a series of aggressive attacks by criminals seeking payments from larger companies, an apparent shift in target for extortionists in the country. On August 26, unidentified assailants in Comayaguela threw a Molotov cocktail at a building belonging to Camiones y Motores S.A. (Camosa), a distributor for agricultural machinery, such as John Deere tractors, reported El Heraldo. The attack followed another that took place on August 18, when assailants shot out windows of a Camosa store and left a threatening note demanding extortion payments. According to La Tribuna , the two attacks form part of a series of incidents in recent months whereby extortionists have targeted larger, well-known companies in Honduras that produce items such as bread, milk , and coffee. On August 29 and 30, for instance, two trucks belonging to a grocery distributor were burned in Tegucigalpa, with extortionists leaving behind notes demanding payment of the so called ""war tax,"" or extortion fee. In response, Armando Urtecho, director of the Honduran Private Enterprise Council (Consejo Hondureno de la Empresa Privada - COHEP), has called on businesses to abstain from paying extortion fees and to report any criminal activity. Urtecho also lamented what he viewed as lack of police action to combat extortion, and challenged authorities to be more rigorous in applying the law. He noted Honduras' large, national-level distribution companies are now incurring extra costs to protect themselves from criminals; something he fears may deter investment in the country. Honduras has long struggled to rein in extortion, a largely gang-driven phenomenon that is estimated to result in total economic losses of $200 million per year -- about 1 percent of Honduras' gross national product -- including associated costs like increased security. Previously, however, the favored targets of Honduran extortionists have been small- to medium-sized businesses. This has been particularly true for companies within the transportation sector , which, according to a 2014 government study , pay an estimated $27 million a year. Bus and taxi operators have been a favorite target of the gangs. In 2016 to date, roughly 30 buses have been burned by extortionists in Honduras, a form of intimidation and retribution for those who fail to pay up. Recent incidents, however, suggest extortionists are becoming more bolder and more ambitious, and are moving beyond small businesses and transportation companies to target larger, well-established companies with a national reach. While doing so may produce higher paydays for criminals in the short-term, it is also likely to draw heightened scrutiny to the issue and trigger crackdowns by law enforcement. Indeed, despite COHEP's criticism, it does appear Honduran authorities are making some progress in combatting the extortion industry. Over 400 people have been arrested this year on charges of extorting transportation organizations."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Attacks on Guatemala Bus Drivers Persist. Over 400 people died in attacks against Guatemala's public transport sector last year, violence that is typically linked to extortion and organized crime. However, the government's response thus far may not be enough to stem the killings. Every day, bus driver Ricardo Lopez wakes up at 5 a.m., gives his wife and three-year-old son a kiss, crosses himself, and leaves for work. However, he never knows if he will see his loved ones again, because the company he works for is being extorted. This article originally appeared in Connectas and was translated and edited for clarification, and reprinted with permission. See Spanish original here. Like Ricardo (whose name was changed for safety reasons), many bus drivers in Guatemala's second-largest city, Quetzaltenango, are afraid to board their vehicles, because the job is becoming increasingly dangerous -- as is the case in many cities. Seven bus drivers were killed in Quetzaltenango in 2014 alone, and authorities registered more than 10 attacks in all. So far this year, one bus driver has been killed in Quetzaltenango, but they are not the only ones affected by the violence. Besides drivers, those who use public transportation are also at risk. One case involved Mariana Zeledon and Almengor Gomez, both age 58, who were taken by firefighters to a city hospital with several bullet wounds, after bus assistant Rafael Rojas was killed while traveling towards the town of Olintepeque. Since 2009, extortion of the transport sector has become a way for organized crime to obtain illicit funds, a type of ""insurance."" The capital, Guatemala City, sees 60 percent of all attacks, with the other 40 percent in other departments. Quetzaltenango registers the second highest number of extortion cases in the country, according to Mario Bosos, an assistant to the Attorney General's Office (or the Public Ministry, as it is known in Guatemala). He added these crimes are committed against bus drivers, businessmen, and can even occur in houses. ""The reason is because [a detention facility] is located in Quetzaltenango, where the majority of extortion calls are made,"" Bosos explained. According to official reports, gangs are behind 10 percent of extortion cases, while the other 90 percent involve individuals who are trying to scare their victims into paying up. Authorities have little control over these activities. Extortionists threaten business owners, but the employees are the ones who suffer the reprisals. In Ricardo's case, he said he only risks working as a bus driver because of the high unemployment rate, and he has no other options. A Worrying Situation Despite victims filing reports, extortion is increasing because many of these cases go unresolved , according to Estuardo Miranda, the vice president of Quetzaltenango's Association of Public Transportation. The situation is even more difficult for the owners and drivers of inter-city buses, because the extortion fees are higher. Some bus drivers, who preferred to have their names omitted for this story out of fear of reprisal, indicated they are constantly threatened and they prefer to pay the fee rather than face the alternative. There have been a few times that drivers have halted bus services as a form of protest, demanding that the government dismantle these criminal groups. Nevertheless, the government is taking increasingly fewer actions to combat the crime. Edwin Ardiano, head of the 41st Precinct of Guatemala's civilian police force (PNC), said authorities have initiated a security offensive in Quetzaltenango and that, along with special forces, police have conducted investigations that led to the arrest of extortionists. Ardiano also said drivers should immediately file a report so that authorities can more effectively investigate extortion calls. In the meantime, Ricardo continues working for the bus company and risking his life behind the steering wheel. Extortion at the National Level According to an office that deals with public transport users at the Inspector General's Office on Human Rights, last year saw the following deaths in Guatemala's 22 departments: 102 bus drivers, 42 mini-bus drivers, 75 motorcycles taxi drivers, 35 taxi drivers, 33 support staff, 102 public transport users, 16 suspected robbers, as well as six private and public security officers. In total, 412 deaths, the majority of which resulted from isolated extortion cases. So far in 2015, there have been 42 deaths. According to security analyst Julio Jerez, the problem of extortion is rooted in the lack of long-term government policies to address this issue. ""The changing of administrations stalls reform,"" he said. ""Government agencies should be working on finding ways to reduce unemployment and prevent organized crime from gaining too much ground. In addition, the disintegration of the family structure pushes adolescents to join criminal groups."" Edgar Guerra of the Inspector General's Office on Human Rights said that on a national scale, the number of extortion operations has exceeded state capacities to effectively combat this crime. Anti-Extortion 'Wolf' Force Not Enough Guatemala's Interior Ministry has implemented a plan to combat extortion -- however, it is concentrated in Guatemala City. ""We have three hotlines specifically for extortion, and there are 1,400 police patrolling the most dangerous sectors of the capital that can respond immediately,"" Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez said. This special police force is known as the Wolf Force (Fuerza Lobo), and consists of specialized personnel roaming the principal avenues of Guatemala City in pairs, one driving while the other travels on foot, ensuring there is no suspicious activity on the buses. They sometimes carry out surprise operations on passengers, drivers, and drivers' assistants. Nevertheless, there is no such special force in Quetzaltenango. Due to the violence there, many are now calling for a similar type of security force in Quetzaltenango, so that it isn't just one sector of the country benefitting from these types of measures. *This article was written by Fred Rivera, as part of the Investigative Reporting Initiative in the Americas by the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), in partnership with Connectas.

"Guatemala Extortion Generates $61 Mn A Year: Govt. Authorities in Guatemala estimate criminals make around $61 million a year from extortion, a figure that illustrates the extent to which this crime impacts businesses and families. According to figures compiled by Guatemala's Interior Ministry, the biggest earners for criminals dedicated to extortion are the public transport sector and small businesses, each of which brings in around $23 million a year, reported Siglo 21. Extorting local families earns criminals an additional $2.6 million. The $61 million figure also includes around $4 million in profits obtained from ""express kidnappings"" -- in which the victim is held hostage for a short period of time. While gangs are responsible for an estimated 35 percent of extortion in the country, the other 65 percent is carried out by other criminal actors that the government referred to as ""opportunists."" A total of 74 criminal groups engaged in extortion have been dismantled since 2011, and 250 people have been arrested for this crime. The three Guatemalan municipalities most affected by extortion are Guatemala City, Mixco and Villa Nueva. Extortion in an endemic problem in the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, where gangs make a large portion of their income from this crime. Transportation companies and small businesses in the region have been especially hard-hit by extortion. Around 70 percent of El Salvador's small businesses have been victims of gang extortion, a phenomenon that has caused an average of two businesses a week to close down, according to the country's National Council for Small Businesses. In Honduras, criminal groups earn more than $27 million a year from extorting the transport sector. The crime can easily turn deadly. In Honduras, 153 taxi drivers were killed between 2012 and 2014 in violent confrontations, while in Guatemala, murders of public transport drivers doubled in the first half of 2013. The most recent Guatemala figures indicate that, while street gangs are often blamed for the bulk of extortion, other criminal actors also play a significant role. However, it is possible they do so only with the blessing of the gangs: a February case revealed that some extortion groups in Guatemala were paying part of their profits to the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha (MS13), the country's two principal gangs, in order to operate."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Honduras Extortion Gangs Undergoing Violent Leadership Crisis. Police in Honduras say moves to block cell phone signals in prisons have weakened the control of the incarcerated heads of extortion gangs, leading to increased violence as gangs fragment and mid-level operators compete for control of the market. Officials from the anti-extortion unit of the Honduran police told El Heraldo that many gang leaders had lost control of their subordinates on the outside as they had been isolated by the shutting down of phone signals in jails. According to the police, lower-level gang members have been running their own unauthorized extortion operations and withholding money from leaders. This has led to the fragmentation of some of the main extortion gangs, as well as revenge killings over unpaid money. An additional problem is that gang members on the outside tend to be much younger, less experienced and more prone to making mistakes than the leaders, say police. The main three gangs behind extortion in Honduras were the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13), Barrio 18 and Los Chirizos. However, in recent months Los Chirizos have fragmented and splinter groups are competing over what was their territory. After Honduran authorities began blocking cell phone signals in February, the government claimed reported extortions fell by 75 percent , illustrating the extent to which prisoners had been controlling this crime in Honduras. However, these extortion operations also require personnel on the outside to collect payments and carry out attacks against those that do not pay. For this reason, the isolation of imprisoned leaders was always likely to have secondary effects. Those on the outside have seen the opportunity to increase their own power and share of the profits, sparking violence as leaders try to retain control and splinter groups fight for a share of the organization's territory. This pattern is common in all areas of organized crime. Decapitation policies that remove top leaders often lead to an increase in violence and chaos as mid-level operatives fight over criminal revenues once controlled by a unified organization.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Peru Extortion Shows Strengthening of Homegrown Criminal Groups. A leader of Peru's business community has highlighted the extensive profits and impact of extortion gangs throughout the country, and their increasing targeting of small businesses, in another sign low-level organized crime in the country is growing and evolving. Moises Mieses Valencia, president of Peru's National Confederation of Businessmen (Conaco) and a mayoral candidate for the capital, Lima , said over 500 businesses nationwide had been extorted in 2014, collectively paying around $18 million in the year so far in the capital, reported Peru 21. Around 100 extortion gangs exist in Lima alone, targeting florists, restaurants, taxis, and small stores to demand between $3,500 and $355,000 in payment, according to Mieses. Many of these groups operate from prison, and use social media, cell phones, or mail to intimidate and threaten businesses, Mieses told La Republica. The crime -- which Mieses labels ""urban terrorism"" due to its destabilizing effect on the economy -- has caused 30 percent of extorted businesses to move or close over the past several years. Extortion has become a widespread phenomenon in Peru, as proliferating local criminal groups have increasingly turned to a source of revenue that has caused a major headache in other countries from the region, such as Colombia. The crime also seems to be following a ""micro"" pattern similar to that seen in Colombia, in that it is not just major companies being extorted, but small street-level businesses. The growth of extortion in Peru has arguably been facilitated by a culture of impunity, with some police even protecting and colluding with criminal groups. Rising extortion is one of a number of signs that low-level organized crime groups are increasingly flourishing in Peru. The country's cocaine trade is also now run mainly by family-based criminal clans operating in the Huallaga Valley, rather than cells of major transnational groups. Peru is also affected by human trafficking networks, which target victims largely for the domestic trade, and widespread illegal mining that helps fuel sex trafficking and forced labor, and is also thought to have connections to the drug trade. Peru's status as the world's primary cocaine producer has likely contributed to the growth of local organized crime, with micro-trafficking catalyzing the birth of small local criminal syndicates. While it is unclear whether the gangs operating around the country have any connection with the wider drug trade at the moment, as they continue to grow stronger, it is possible they will step up to play a significant role."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Will Ecuador Extortion Rise with Growth of International Organized Crime?Prosecutors in Ecuador are investigating a wave of extortions believed to have been carried out by the same criminal group, raising the question of what effect the growing presence of transnational organized crime will have on local criminal activities. Between September and December of 2013, Quito authorities received 75 reports of extortion committed by one group, reported El Comercio. The modus operandi of the group was to make threatening phone calls to victims to convince them to hand over large sums of money using transfer services. Up to 300 other victims were targeted last year, prosecutor Jose Luis Jaramillo told La Hora. One victim was contacted after publishing a notice offering a reward for anyone who found her pet. The extortionists had information about how many children she had and what time she arrived and left work. She gave them $300 after being threatened. Another victim was told that the criminals had a ""personal"" video of him, and it would be handed over to his wife unless he paid $500. The 75 victims between September and December were called from 60 different telephone numbers, one of which was traced to a SIM card found in a Quito jail. On February 4, the Armed Forces in the major port city of Guayaquil also announced they had detained five Marines -- one sergeant, three corporals and a sailor -- who were being investigated by prosecutors after being accused of extortion, reported El Comercio. Extortion is a mainstay of criminal groups across Latin America -- it is a practice that brings in millions and serves as a primary form of income for street gangs in countries including Guatemala, El Salvador and Colombia. Ecuador has a very different criminal landscape than that of many of its neighbors. It is historically a safer country, with no major domestic criminal organizations. As such, extortion has not been a major problem, and even fell from 246 cases in 2011 to 167 cases in 2012. Nonetheless, the recent cases illustrate the crime does persist. The telephone threats follow typical Latin American extortion patterns, as does the fact that one call was traced to a prison. The possible number of additional victims noted by prosecutor Jaramillo also indicates the crime may be significantly underreported. As foreign criminal drug trafficking organizations -- particularly from Colombia -- continue to establish themselves in Ecuador, this type of crime may start to increase, as seems to be happening with microtrafficking in the country. However, homicide rates dropped to a nine-year low during 2013, suggesting the presence of transnational crime is not yet bringing the same ills that it has elsewhere in the region."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Colombia Seeks to Contain Extortion by Doubling Sentences. Colombia, suffering explosive growth in extortion demands, is seeking to almost double sentences for those convicted of the crime. In a legislative project to be brought before Congress, the Colombian government plans to almost double the maximum sentence for extortion from 18 to 32 years. The minimum sentence for those convicted of extortion would jump from 8 to 16 years. Some estimates have put the annual criminal income from extortion at over $1 billion. According to the specialized anti-kidnapping and anti-extortion unit of the police, the GAULA, small businesses pay between $250 and $2500 a month, depending on their earnings. Even many street vendors have to pay extortion fees of up to a dollar a day to be allowed to operate. If the law is passed, it would bring the sentencing for extortion into the same range as that for murder. The average conviction for premeditated murder in Colombia is around 25 years. Extortion used to be the preserve of Marxist rebels, who targeted the big national and multinational corporations. Today, while the rebels are still deeply involved in extortion, they have been overtaken by the new generation of drug trafficking groups, known as the BACRIM (from the goverment's description of the groups as ""bandas criminals""). The profile of the victim has also changed dramatically. The extortion of big companies and multi-nationals has actually fallen, while ""micro extortion"" has undergone explosive growth, with most victims now local shop owners and small businesses. Broadly speaking, the rebels impose most of their extortion demands in rural areas, or the smaller urban centers, although there are indications that the guerrillas are seeking to expand their extortion activities into the major cities. However in the top three urban centers of Colombia -- the capital Bogota, Medellin and Cali -- extortion rackets are predominantly run by local street gangs or the BACRIM. The introduction of this legislation is perhaps a knee-jerk reaction by the government, which is fighting the general perception that the security situation is worsening, even as it engages in peace talks with the Marxist insurgency. What is clear is that crime, particularly in the urban centers, is increasing, and extortion is leading the charge."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Businesses in Honduran Capital Beseiged By Crime, Extortion. More than 90 percent of businesses in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa have experienced security threats, mostly in the form of extortion, highlighting the stranglehold criminal gangs have on the country's economy. A survey among Tegucigalpan business owners revealed that nearly all had suffered security problems ranging from theft to frequent threats by criminal groups demanding money in exchange for safety, Mario Bustillo, head of the city's chamber of commerce, told Honduran daily La Tribuna. Most businesses in Tegucigalpa are small-to-medium sized, according to the chamber's report, leaving them more vulnerable to extortion. Criminal gangs like the MS-13 and Barrio 18 , both of which have operations in Tegucigalpa, are known to rely heavily on extortion as a key source of funding. The practice has taken its toll on Honduras's economy: A July survey by Honduran newspaper El Heraldo found that a third of Tegucigalpa businesses had folded or fled to Nicaragua because of extortion demands. The lost businesses would result in lowered government tax revenue and higher unemployment, Bustillo noted. Unemployed youth, in turn, provide ready recruits for gangs extorting the city's businesses, police commissioner Alex Villanueva stated. Honduras has attempted to combat extortion on a variety of fronts. Police have set up telephone hotlines for businesses to report threats anonymously but at the same time police agents are suspected by many of participating in the extortion rackets. The government also recently announced a deal with a group of international investors allowing them to construct three privately run cities in the country -- with services including a private security force and judicial system -- as potential safe-havens for companies. But, as InSight Crime reported in July, gangs have adopted new extortion tactics in response to police efforts to quell the practice. MS-13 members, for instance, wear smart business attire to infiltrate upscale enterprises and later extort them. And recent reports indicate the problem has broadened beyond the scope of businesses. Gangs have begun to extort Honduran individuals, too, demanding payments for allowing them to live safely in their own homes, the Associated Press reported in June .	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Could Guatemala Citys Smart Bus System Cut Extortion?Guatemala City's replacement of its old buses with a more secure system where drivers do not handle cash could help cut down on extortion of bus companies and reduce violence on public transportation. The murder of three bus company employees in Guatemala City on July 25 is just the latest example of the dangers faced by public transit workers and passengers in Guatemala. Extortion of bus drivers and companies by criminal gangs in Guatemala has become so pervasive and violent that a 2011 InSight Crime investigation concluded that driving a bus in Guatemala may be the most dangerous job in the world. According to the Human Rights Ombudsman's 2011 Annual Report , 1,368 people were murdered on Guatemala's public transportation in the past six years: 780 drivers, 255 bus assistants (""brochas""), and 249 passengers. Some 59 percent of violence on buses took place in the country's capital. The government pays around $35 million in subsidies each year to bus companies in order to make transportation affordable for most Guatemalans, but there is little oversight of bus safety, rates, or routes. The old buses, which are often reused US school buses , run on a cash payment system that makes extortion easy. Drivers and passengers face violence when gang members board buses to collect payment or punish those who refuse to pay. The extortion schemes are typically run by gangs such as Mara Salvatrucha ( MS-13 ) and Barrio 18 , whose leaders oversee the operations from within Guatemala's prisons. Government investigators say that the gangs charge bus companies around 200 quetzales ($25) per week per bus, adding up to around Q40,000 ($5,000) per week per bus route. This system provides a major source of revenue for gangs, who collected an estimated $1.5 million from bus companies in 2010. The bus companies themselves are sometimes involved in the extortion of their rivals; Guatemala's Attorney General's Office recently reported that some sell personal information about employees of their competitors to gangs, making it easier for the criminals to threaten them. The high level of gang penetration, corruption in the bus companies, and the weakness of Guatemala's institutions make combating violence and extortion on public transport extremely challenging. The expansion of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Guatemala City, however, could prove to be an effective strategy for reducing extortion of bus companies and violence against drivers and passengers. First used in Curitiba, Brazil in 1974, BRT systems employ dedicated bus lanes to channel high-capacity buses along a series of fixed stations. BRT's modern appearance and low cost have made it very appealing for governments in Latin America. The first line of Guatemala's BRT system, the Transmetro, opened in 2007. A second was added in 2009, and as of June of this year the Transmetro was serving an average of 268,000 passengers each day. Designed to appeal not only to the 68 percent of residents who typically use public transport but also to car owners looking to cut the cost and length of their commute, the Transmetro currently consists of two lines and 32 stations, with more planned for the future. It is run by the Guatemala City municipal government and receives support from the United Nations Development Program. The kinds of extortion schemes run by gangs on traditional buses are impossible on Transmetro due to its digital payment system. Most traditional buses in Guatemala lack cash collection machines. Instead, an assistant, known as a ""brocha,"" or the bus driver himself collects the fare directly from passengers. On Transmetro, however, passengers either insert Q1 ($0.13) into electronic fareboxes at the entrance of the stations or use prepaid cards to pay their fare. This payment system cuts out the drivers from the process of fare collection and gets rid of the bus assistants, who are sometimes affiliated with gangs. The centralized structure and government oversight of the Transmetro system make it much safer. Weapons are banned on board the buses, and the stations are equipped with closed circuit cameras and patrolled by municipal police. The fixed entry and exit points, coupled with the presence of the municipal police, make it difficult for assailants to escape after committing a crime. Some sources say that as of 2011 there had been no murders, armed robberies, or other violent incidents reported on the Transmetro, although this has not been confirmed by the authorities. The Transmetro only serves a portion of Guatemala City's bus drivers and passengers today, but it is a step in the right direction. Working for Transmetro, rather than for a private bus company, will not prevent drivers from being extorted at home in neighborhoods controlled by gangs, but it does allow them to go to work each day with less fear of violence."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Extortion Shuts Down 1/3 of Businesses in Honduran Capital. Extortion has reportedly forced 30 percent of small businesses in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa to close, demonstrating the economic cost of insecurity in the country. According to an El Heraldo report, 30 percent of Tegucigalpa's small businesses -- some 10,800 -- active in the beginning of 2012 have closed due to frequent threats from criminals attempting to extort money. Some business owners have elected to move to Nicaragua, where they believe the government does a better job of providing security, reported El Heraldo, whose survey showed that there is a general distrust of the police in Tegucigalpa. Some Hondurans worry that corrupt police officers might even be assisting criminals in extortion schemes making victims hesitant to come forward to police for fear of retaliation. Tegucigalpa's Deputy Police Commissioner Elvis Bonilla Andara explained to the newspaper that steps have been taken to make reporting the crime easier. According to Bonilla Andara, Hondurans can now make complaints anonymously via telephone, a policy that has helped police to capture five alleged extortioners so far in July. In an attempt to combat extortion nationwide, the Honduran government passed legislation in March that increased prison terms for the crime from nine years to 20 years, making the penalty one of the highest in the region for extortion. Honduran security forces also launched an operation that month to patrol the most dangerous bus and taxi routes to help protect drivers from extortion gangs. Other Central American countries struggle similarly with the crime. In Guatemala, police arrested seven people in June for allegedly extorting close to $500,000 from bus drivers in the capital. This phenomenon reached such levels in El Salvador that bus drivers went on strike in August 2011 to put pressure on their government to increase security against gangs' extortion demands. Extortion is not just a threat to security, but to development as well. El Heraldo's report notes that extortion has adverse long term effects on the Honduran economy, causing rising bankruptcy, unemployment, and capital flight. 	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Mexico Internet Scam Extorts Applicants for Fake Jobs. Mexico City security officials are reportedly investigating an Internet fraud ring that used fake job offers to elicit resumes from potential employees, then used the information to extort the applicants. There have been 50 complaints registered at the Federal District's Citizen's Council for Public Security in the past two weeks, reports Cronica. Victims would reportedly receive e-mails using the names of large businesses like baked goods company Bimbo, dairy company Grupo Lala, or PepsiCo (who saw one of its subsidiary food companies attacked last week by the Knights Templar , in an assault believed to be linked to extortion). The e-mails described jobs offers and asked the recipients to respond with the resumes and other personal data. Sometimes the e-mails would be sent from fake g-mail accounts using the names of the big businesses, like lalamx.selectagmail.com. Sometimes the applicants would be told that they had to deposit 200 pesos (about $14) in a bank account, to pay for medical tests that formed part of the job application process. Other applicants received threats that referred to personal data made available in their resumes. The threatening messages promised not to harm the applicant's family in exchange for a 3,000 peso payment (about $212), to be deposited in a local bank account. Mexico City's Attorney General Office said that they have since closed this bank account, but they have not yet identified how many people could have been involved in this extortion scheme. The Cronica report notes that it is likely that the extortionists used public Internet cafes to send the e-mails, to make them more difficult to track down. The case has reportedly now been handed over to the cyber crime unit of the Attorney General's Office. The Internet is a convenient tool that can be used for extortion threats, thanks to the anonymity it can provide and its accessibility. The usage of the Internet for extortion is another symptom of the democratization of crime: it is relatively easy for anyone to get involved in this kind of scheme. A congressman said last year that Mexico has more reported incidents of cybercrime than anywhere else in the world. As this latest case in Mexico City indicates, the government has good reason to bulk up its capacity to fight this kind of illicit activity. 	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Lima Street Gang Rivalry Re-Emerges: Report. Two Lima gangs have reignited their struggle for control of the city's extortion rackets, according to Peruvian media, prompting fears of a rise in violence in the country's capital. The recent killing of a 63-year-old mechanic in Lima was allegedly a result of inter-gang rivalry between a group known as the ""Noles"" and their rivals, the ""Malditos de Castilla,"" (Damned of Castilla). The victim was mistakenly assassinated during an attempt on the life of Wilbur Castillo Sanchez, the alleged head of the Malditos de Castilla, reported La Republica. Two alleged members of the Noles were subsequently arrested, but have since been freed, with the judge citing a lack of evidence. According to La Republica, the latest homicide points to the re-emergence of the conflict between the two gangs over control of extortion networks in Lima. The rackets focus predominantly on construction, though they also include schools and retail companies. Some 17 members of the two gangs have been murdered since 2008, when the Noles reportedly killed the leader of the Damned of Castilla, Wilson Pedro Mesias, alias ""Pedrito."" Peru's government has said that there are some 13,000 gang members in the country, most based in Lima. These gangs are mostly thought to be neighborhood-based, and focused on crimes like extortion, robbery, kidnapping and hired killings, with only limited contact with international drug trafficking networks. As InSight Crime noted last year , Peru has rolled out community-based schemes to deal with the gang problem. The latest clashes between the groups could suggest that these have not gone far enough yet. Recent reports in the Peruvian media have noted that taxi extortion mafias based in the city of Trujillo have extended their extortion networks as far as Lima. "	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Guatemala Inmates Extorted 5 Star Hotels in El Salvador. Guatemala prison inmates have been accused of making threatening phone calls to large hotel chains in neighboring El Salvador, pointing to the growing popularity of long-distance extortion schemes. Prosecutors from Guatemala and El Salvador are investigating an alleged extortion ring that was run from a maximum security prison (pictured) in Escuintla department, southern Guatemala. The gang reportedly targeted large businesses in neighboring El Salvador, among them the Sheraton and Hilton hotels, reports Prensa Libre. According to the prosecutors handling the case, hotel owners and managers received threatening calls demanding up to $500,000 in payments. In some cases, after receiving the threats the victims transferred payments of $2,000 to $5,000 via Western Union. Investigations managed to trace the origin of most of the phone calls back to the Infiernito maximum security prison in Escuintla. Other calls were traced back to the Guatemalan city of Jalapa. Eight people have been arrested and sent to El Salvador where they will be tried for extortion. Prosecutors say they are currently investigating an additional 15 complaints. According to Prensa Libre, the group behind the long distance calls is known as the ""Chapin"" prison gang. They may have also tried to extort victims in Honduras. Extortion by cell phone is an attractive and relatively low-risk option for criminals. Callers can make threats sound convincing by exploiting information about the victim's personal life easily obtained from social networking websites, such as the names of their children or the vehicle that they drive. Callers may also claim to be affiliated to large criminal organizations like the Zetas, in order to amplify their threats. The Guatemala case indicates that more groups are willing to place calls outside their native country. Guatemala has also reported receiving extortion threats from callers in Mexico , who have identified themselves as the Zetas. Such extortion rings are typically run from inside prison, as seems to be the case with the so-called Chapin group. If they were able to successfully extort thousands of dollars from large companies across the border in El Salvador -- who presumably believed the gang would make good on their threats -- it points to just how easy it is for prison gangs to profit from these extortion schemes, often with little more than a phone number. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recently announced that it would help train a new anti-extortion unit in El Salvador , where nearly 3,000 extortion cases were reported last year.

"ELN Kidnapping a Major Obstacle to Peace Talks?Colombia's ELN guerrillas' refusal to formally renounce kidnapping may prove to be a major obstacle for the start of peace talks with the government that were announced by both sides earlier this year. According to Colombia's Defense Ministry, the National Liberation Army (ELN) is currently holding nine hostages, reported El Espectador. However, Pais Libre, a non-governmental organization that tracks kidnapping in Colombia, reports that the ELN has only two hostages. The government is currently involved in peace talks with Colombia's biggest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). The FARC's decision to publicly renounced kidnapping in 2012 was widely seen as having helped convince the government to sit down and negotiate with the rebel group. The ELN, however, has failed to do the same despite agreeing to enter into its own peace process with the government. In an interview with El Espectador , ELN leader Israel Ramirez Pineda, alias ""Pablo Beltran,"" said kidnapping was an issue ""on the table"" for upcoming peace talks. ""The government has gone to a lot of effort to make sure that this issue would be addressed,"" he added. The issue is complicated by two recent kidnappings that the ELN has reportedly profited from. In early April, the ELN released former governor Patrocinio Sanchez Montes de Oca, whom they'd kidnapped in 2013. Recently, however, Sanchez revealed to Colombian media that he was not released as a good-will gesture -- he was exchanged for his brother. Sanchez was in ill health, so his brother insisted on taking his place, the former governor said. In a similar situation, the ELN released a hostage in March who had been kidnapped in September 2015. The minister of Interior has described that release as ""a gesture that opens the possibility of finally beginning formal negotiations."" However, that hostage later said he was released after his family paid the guerrillas a ransom , rather than as a gesture of good will. The ELN are obviously reluctant to give up a criminal activity that they have long relied on for cash , and they may not be the only guerrilla group to feel this way. Notably, there have been reports that the FARC are encouraging increased planting of coca crops, perhaps in order to have a bigger reserve of funds should the government start seizing their other assets. The ELN may refuse to formally renounce kidnapping until the group has built up its own cash reserves. It is possible that the guerrillas also see this as a way to pressure the government into a bilateral ceasefire before continuing negotiations."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Argentina Still Struggling with Virtual, Real Kidnappings. New data from Argentina indicates virtual and real kidnappings continue to be a security concern in Buenos Aires, although government efforts to tackle these issues may be helping to rein these crimes in. Official data shows that police in Buenos Aires received reports of 196 virtual kidnappings during the first four months of 2016, according to Clarin. That is more than one virtual kidnapping per day between January and April. The scam abductions were reported most often in the neighborhoods of Recoleta, Palermo and Belgrano, with 28, 22 and 17 cases, respectively. Virtual or ""fake"" kidnapping is an extortion scheme which consists in making a victim believe that one of their relatives is being held under threat. Unlike express kidnappings and kidnap for ransom, the act of abduction itself never occurs in a virtual kidnapping. The scheme is carried out by contacting the targeted victim -- often an elderly person -- from a phone booth or an untraceable cell phone. Calling in the early morning hours and playing a fake recording of a person crying are some of the techniques used to evoke an emotional response in the victim and mentally coerce them into paying a ransom. Minister of National Security Patricia Bullrich said the new data also shows a simultaneous decrease of registered kidnap for ransom in the Buenos Aires Province, reported Clarin. These fell from 137 cases during the first five months of 2015 to 115 over the same period this year. Speaking to Congress, the minister admitted that the government is concerned about this persistent security issue, and that it will continue fighting it via anti-kidnapping brigades and other measures, Clarin reported. The number of reported virtual kidnappings is lower than the record-breaking totals registered in 2014, which saw 234 cases in the month of February alone. That spike prompted the authorities to create a special unit of prosecutors to deal with the problem (Comision de Secuestros Virtuales de la Procuracion). The unit's efforts over the past two years may have been instrumental in lowering the number of cases. But the the frequency with which complaints continued to be filed and the fact that an unknown number of cases go unreported indicate that virtual kidnapping remains a significant security concern, especially in certain neighborhoods of Buenos Aires. The statistics should also to be considered in light of a parallel rise of express kidnappings in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, as well as the concentration of 73 percent of kidnap for ransom in that same area, according to Ambito. Express kidnappings usually involve snatching someone on the street and holding them in a car, often their own vehicle, while a ransom is arranged. Overall kidnapping cases for Argentina are, however, considerably lower than Mexico's 1,698 reported cases in 2013. But they do bring the country to around the same level as Colombia, which suffered from an average 300 reported kidnappings per year between 2012 and 2015, a phenomenon largely associated with that country's internal conflict."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Report Claims Huge Rise in Venezuela Kidnappings. Kidnappings in Venezuela have risen 170% in 2016 according to a new report based on citizen perceptions, highlighting the inability of the state to provide security as economic and political crises continue to engulf the nation. The study, published by the Institute of Criminal Science and Criminology at the University of Santa Maria in Caracas, says the number of kidnapping cases has quintupled over the past 150 days, El Nacional reported. However, the statistics in the report were based on anecdotal evidence and perceptions, as there are no official statistics and kidnapping is hugely underreported. The study estimated that only 8 percent of cases are reported to the police. According to the report, the overwhelming majority of kidnappings are brief, with 94 percent concluding within 24 hours, and most take place at times and on days of reduced police activity. The report also noted that violence and brutality during kidnappings has increased, and stories of sexual abuse, physical torture, and executions have proliferated. State security forces are woefully underprepared to deal with the wave of kidnappings, the institute states. Venezuela's investigative police, the CICPC, only has 200 staff nationwide who have to deal with roughly seven cases a day, each requiring a minimum of 15 officers to work. The lack of official government statistics and the issue of underreporting means it is difficult to accurately map kidnapping trends in Venezuela, making perceptual and anecdotal evidence such as that collected in this new report a valuable if flawed source of information. Despite this lack of solid data, the report adds to a weight of evidence that there has been an uptick in kidnapping in recent years. InSight Crime field research in Caracas in 2015 revealed that in particular ""express"" kidnappings -- where small immediate ransoms are demanded, often by forcing the victim to withdraw money from their bank account -- are becoming ever more common. Sources in Caracas estimated that forty express kidnappings take place in the city every week, and that many involve corrupt members of the police. As Venezuela's economic and political crisis deepens, there is little sign of the state taking decisive action against kidnapping or other crimes that indicate deteriorating security. Currently, President Nicolas Maduro is occupied fighting off the prospect of a recall referendum, and facing up to his administration's security failures is likely way down on the government's agenda."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Reports of Migrant Kidnapping in Mexico Up 1000%. Reports of migrant kidnapping in Mexico have increased dramatically over a single year, a phenomenon that may be linked to increased migration from Central America, rising kidnapping rates in Mexico, or just better reporting. There were 682 reported migrant kidnappings in 2014, an increase of 1000 percent from 2013, according to figures from Mexico's National Institute of Migration (INM), which were obtained by Excelsior via a freedom of information act request. Of those kidnapped, 365 were Hondurans, 200 Salvadorans, 100 Guatemalans and 17 Nicaraguans. The numbers also show an increase in ""other crimes"" committed against migrants -- including extortion and abuse -- rising from 43 to 119. However, there were just 29 migrants who were victims of human trafficking in 2013, according to the INM's statistics. Ultimately, the explanation behind this huge increase in reported migrant kidnapping could well be a mix of the reasons described below. Firstly, there is the matter of the huge spike in Central American migrants attempting to reach the United States in 2014. This rapid increase in migrants , many of whom were unaccompanied children or families and therefore even more vulnerable to criminal groups, died down almost as quickly as it shot up. If this was a factor, the number of migrant kidnappings can be expected to fall again in 2015. The increase could also be related to broader changes within Mexico's underworld. Since President Enrique Pena Nieto took power in late 2012, overall kidnapping has increased by 52 percent, according to official statistics published by Animal Politico. The increase in migrant kidnapping may be part of the same pattern. The states most affected by kidnapping -- Tamaulipas, Guerrero, and Michoacan -- are the same ones that have seen an intense fragmentation of organized crime groups. As these criminal structures look to earn funds from other sources besides transnational drug trafficking, the increasingly independent local factions have turned to other crimes, including kidnapping to make up the shortfall in income. It is also possible the increase is at least partly a result of better reporting and collating of statistics, especially as the INM has only maintained statistics on migrant kidnapping since 2012. This increased attention towards the problem may yet encourage state institutions to take the crime more seriously -- and, crucially, result in more people reporting it."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"How Haiti Successfully Curbed Kidnappings. Until recently, abductions in Haiti were rampant and almost always happened the same way: ski-mask-clad kidnappers would surround a house, force entry, ransack the place and leave with a vulnerable victim -- usually a woman, child or elderly person. The family would pay ransom, and if the victim was released alive, law enforcement would call it a success. That began to change two years ago, after the United Nations introduced anti-kidnapping support led by Robert Arce, a veteran American cop and law enforcement consultant who spent more than three decades on anti-drug, kidnapping and human smuggling units along the US-Mexico border and in Bosnia and Iraq. This article originally appeared on the Inter-American Development Bank's blog Sin Miedos. Read the original here. Thanks to a strategy of cell phone log exploitation, community policing, and some cultural diplomacy, Arce helped Haitian police turn the tide on a limited budget. By the end of 2013, the number of people arrested for kidnapping had nearly quintupled. In the first nine months, police arrested 15 people for kidnapping; in the last three months, the number jumped to 72, and only one new kidnapping was reported, Arce told the Inter-American Development Bank during a phone interview from his home in Phoenix. ""What I encountered was a mess,"" said Arce, who served as a US Department of State anti-kidnapping advisor for Haiti's National Police under the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) from August 2012 to December 2013. ""There was a kidnapping almost every day, and a lot of victims were being killed. The police were demoralized and overwhelmed, and I didn't know where to start."" Even Francois Henry Dossous, chief of the Haitian National Police's anti-kidnapping unit, was on the verge of leaving. But after the new strategies resulted in a few successful stings, Dossous rallied his officers behind the new program, says Arce. The initial plan was to bolster police training and introduce more sophisticated equipment, not solve current cases, but the bureaucratic red tape was endless. Besides, things could take a turn for the worse if equipment like a $300,000 Stingray -- a cell phone triangulation device -- got into the wrong hands. To further complicate matters, Haitian law does not require phone companies to share phone records with law enforcement. In fact, Arce was alarmed to find cops had never asked phone companies to cooperate with investigations, so convincing them to make that request would be key. ""Listen, you go to cell phone companies and I guarantee you they've known someone who's been kidnapped,'"" Arce told his unit. Indeed, just about every phone company executive said they could relate, and most were willing to help, so officers worked with them to create a detailed log of calls tracking the suspects' general vicinity. From there, they could hone in on them by developing neighborhood informants. ""When I started as a rookie cop in 1981, you'd go out and meet everybody in your neighborhood. You'd go fix broken doors and roofs as a way to gain the trust of the community, and they will start calling you with tips,"" Arce explained. ""It was the same in Iraq. You'd partner with the population, live in their neighborhoods, and also partner with the local media."" In Haiti, the first barrier was linguistic. Arce says the United Nations had been recruiting cops from French speaking countries, but realized fewer and fewer Haitians are speaking French. Recruiting Creole speaking police of Haitian origin from Canada and the United States facilitated the communication. Then came the challenge of operating in a tiny, impoverished nation run by powerful elites. ""One of the hurdles we had to overcome was small island politics where people know each other and favors are owed,"" he said. Arce relied on Haitian-American Brunel Bienvenu to execute his plan. The retired New York Police Department officer was well-versed in community policing and at mentoring other officers. He and the unit spent a lot of time talking to locals in target neighborhoods and monitoring Haitian radio and television talk shows to gauge the public's willingness to cooperate in investigations. ""They were fed up with kidnappings,"" said Arce. Cops like Bienvenu harnessed this sentiment to gain community support and convince the media to set up a 24-hour kidnapping tips hotline. ""They were reluctant at first, but saw the positives when they started getting tips,"" said Arce. Maintaining that momentum was the tricky part. For instance, phone companies might have ties to the victims as well as the perpetrators, and nothing stifled morale like the murder of a kidnapping victim. In March 2013, kidnappers abducted and murdered the 12-year-old son of a Haitian pastor who had returned to his homeland with his family after years living abroad to serve the 2010 earthquake victims. The boy's body was found in a ditch with bullet wounds in his head. The incident left Arce and his team totally distraught. ""I shed a tear for that kid,"" said Arce, ""but I told them, 'we're not doing any good if we feel sorry for ourselves.'"" The next day, police jumped into a heavier investigation, which culminated in the arrest of seven people. The public also responded with a tip about where the alleged shooter would be picking up his own eight-year-old from school. Police swooped in and arrested their suspect. The work of the anti-kidnapping unit is one of several law enforcement capacity building programs taking place in Haiti. In fact, the unit is operating under Central Directorate of the Judicial Police (DCPJ) Director Normil Rameau, who spent three years training in Chile. He recently sent some of his top ranking officers to Colombia to train in tactical operations and intelligence gathering and analysis. Arce believes Haiti's law enforcement progress can be furthered with reforms to communications laws and the prison system. He wants investigators to have the ability to subpoena records, and he believes getting prisoners to trial faster would ease discontent in jails. As it stands, most of the alleged kidnappers his team arrested are still being held without trial. The Haitian government is working with the United States Agency for International Development to address both concerns. Arce recently left Haiti to take a full-time job doing similar advising with the US Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs in Northeastern Mexico, but he is confident Haiti is in good hands. ""I left Haiti feeling we'd saved lives,"" Arce said. ""We prevented families from being terrorized.

"Can Mexicos New Anti-Kidnapping Body Stem the Growth of the Crime?Mexico has created a new unit to combat rising kidnapping in the country, but the question remains of whether this body will tackle the crime more effectively than existing institutions have. The National Anti-Kidnapping Organization was unveiled as part of the National Anti-Kidnapping Strategy during a presentation on January 28. Renato Sales Heredia, a prosecutor whose career has included time working for the Attorney General's Office , was named anti-kidnapping coordinator, reported Animal Politico. According to Sales Heredia, anti-kidnapping units will be created throughout the country as part of the strategy. These will oversee the use of resources to combat the crime, reported Animal Politico. Monte Alejandro Rubido Garcia, executive secretary of the National Public Security System (SNSP), said the objective of the new body is ""management and a concerted effort at the local and federal level."" As part of the project, the Interior Ministry (SEGOB) will coordinate and monitor schemes to prevent, sanction, and dismantle kidnapping operations at the national level. A Special Committee of Monitoring and Evaluation will be integrated into SEGOB to monitor the work of the new organization. This committee will include representatives from the Defense Ministry (SEDENA), the Navy (SEMAR), the Attorney General's Office (PGR), representatives from the National Conference of Governors (CONAGO) and civil society, reported Excelsior. Mexico has seen an uptick in kidnappings and extortion recently, despite promises by President Enrique Pena Nieto to tackle the crime. This increase is, in part, the result of the fragmentation of the country's criminal organizations. As competition has risen among groups, drug proceeds have become increasingly stretched, leading criminal organizations to diversify their revenue streams with crimes like kidnapping and extortion. Rampant impunity has also allowed the crime to perpetuate, as criminals operate with little concern they will be captured or prosecuted. With little chance of resolution and living in fear of retribution, victims are also reluctant to report the crime. A new report by El Universal estimates that 98 percent of kidnappings went unreported in 2012. According to the newspaper, while 1,407 kidnappings were reported that year, it is estimated 89,086 actually took place. (These would presumably include so-called ""express kidnappings"" in which victims are taken for short periods of time, usually after being ambushed in taxis, and empty their bank accounts at gun point.) In this context, one of the most pressing tasks of the new Anti-Kidnapping Organization will be to restore public confidence in the state to deal with the crime, something likely only possible through early and tangible results."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Defense Ministry Says Kidnapping Rose 5% in Colombia 2011, Contrary to Police Claims. Kidnappings in Colombia rose by 5.6 percent in 2011 according to the Ministry of Defense, contradicting police estimates of an 8 percent fall in the same period. The Operational Directorate for the Defense of Personal Liberty, a branch of the Defense Ministry, stated that there were 298 kidnappings in 2011 , 16 more than in 2010. The majority of the kidnappings were carried out by common criminals, with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ), the National Liberation Army ( ELN ) and criminals gangs (BACRIM - ""bandas criminales"") accounting for 26, 10 and 4 percent respectively. Of the 298 captured, 40 were released and 15 died while being held, according to the ministry. The remainder were freed. The Defense Ministry's statistics mark a divergence from the figure of 258 kidnap victims stated by police earlier this year. One explanation for this is likely differences in how crimes are defined by the two institutions, and the filing of some ""express"" kidnappings -- where the victim is held for a short period -- as robberies in order to keep stats down. Despite the disagreement on figures, both bodies agree on the shifting trend in kidnap cases, pointing to the move of the crime from rural to urban areas, and the increasing proportion of kidnappings being carried out by common criminals. Incidents of mass kidnappings make up over 10 percent of the figures, with the abduction of 23 oil workers in Vichada , five in Arauca , and 10 people in a gang-related dispute in Antioquia marking some of the most notable cases. There has been a sharp downward trend in kidnapping rates over the last decade, from a high of 3,572 victims in 2000. Kidnapping rates, however, have begun to creep steadily back up over the past two years in border departments such as Arauca. This will be unwelcome news for President Juan Manuel Santos, who has been criticized for allowing Colombia's security situation to deteriorate since succeeding Alvaro Uribe in 2010. Image, above: The homecoming of Nhora Valentina, the 10-year-old daughter of a mayor in Arauca, whose kidnapping in September 2011 caused a national outcry. "	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Why the FARC May Actually Mean What It Says About Kidnapping. The announcement that Colombia's FARC, the region's oldest and largest insurgency, would halt kidnappings was greeted with mixed emotions. But while the skeptics seem to outnumber the optimists, the new strategic and economic reality of the rebels leaves room for hope. The*Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC's) declaration, slipped into the fifth paragraph of a communique about the pending release of 10 longtime hostages from the security forces, was surprising for both its abruptness and introspective nature. ""Much has been said about retentions [FARC's word for kidnappings] of civilians,"" the group wrote on its website , before stating its intention to eliminate kidnappings as ""part of its revolutionary action."" ""It's time to clarify who and why one kidnaps today in Colombia,"" the group added. [See InSight Crime's FARC profile] Of course, the FARC did not clarify, and many wonder whether the offer was real. Like the longtime hostage Ingrid Betancourt, who was quoted at length in Spain's El Pais , most Colombians seemed to greet the announcement with relief mixed with a healthy dose of skepticism. For his part, Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos Tweeted that the announcement was ""important,"" hardly a call for renewed peace talks (the two sides broke off their last talks in 2002, when the FARC commandeered a commercial aircraft, landed it on a highway and kidnapped several passengers, including a prominent politician). Colombians have a reason to doubt the FARC. The vague language in the communique, and the FARC's 35-year history of kidnapping civilians leave them with little choice. Specifically, the FARC said it was rescinding the ""retention"" portion of the infamous ""Law 002,"" an insurgent ""decree"" issued in 2000 that called for ""taxing"" all citizens above a certain income level. But those income thresholds were impossible to accurately establish, and became irrelevant for those tasked with collection duties. The ""law"" was quickly applied to the middle and upper class alike. To be sure, the FARC had already expanded its kidnapping practices in the 1990s, targeting middle and lower middle class victims, not the wealthy, who tended to draw more attention from the security forces and political circles. That strategy is what led to the dramatic and devastating rise in kidnapping, made Colombia the ""kidnap capital of the world,"" and went a long way towards isolating the group from its base followers. The FARC's current statement on this matter is similarly vague, and the ominous call to ""clarify who and why one kidnaps"" does not sit well. Nor does the fact that kidnapping, in particular by the FARC, showed a slight uptick in 2010 and early 2011. The FARC also makes no mention of stopping extortion. Extortion and kidnapping are often part of the same circle of crimes. In essence, kidnapping becomes a way to ensure regular extortion payments. Eliminating this threat leaves the FARC with other, less effective means of ensuring payment (beatings or other physical abuse) or the choice of employing very extreme measures (murder), which often have high political costs. Nonetheless, there are reasons to be hopeful that this offer may be genuine; some of them political, others strategic, but most of them economic. The last 10 years have left the FARC in a greatly debilitated state, much less present and much less potent than they were when they issued ""Law 002."" No longer able to coerce large portions of the population, the group has to rebuild its political capital. Ceasing kidnapping is quickest way to jump start that process. On a strategic level, the guerrillas have had to alter their war against the state. To begin with, there are simply fewer rebels. The FARC have dropped from an estimated 20,000 soldiers to closer to 8,000. The result is that they are no longer in control of vast geographic spaces. They have also been effectively pushed to the edges of the country and operate in less populous areas. The government's increased presence in the countrysides has also forced them to operate in smaller units who are dedicated to more traditional hit-and-run rebel tactics. This makes it difficult to hold kidnapping victims over long periods of time. Perhaps most importantly, the FARC's decision may reflect a new economic reality of the group: they simply do not make much money kidnapping anymore, and leaving it will not hurt their bottom line. The numbers illustrate this. Kidnappings in Colombia have dropped precipitously. As this graphic created by InSight Crime using data from the Colombia government agency that tracks kidnapping shows, there are currently about 300 reported kidnappings per year, compared to over 3,500 when the practice peaked in 2000. Equally important is the changing nature of the victim. The Colombian government says that kidnapping hits lower middle and lower class more than any other sector. The ransoms have dropped in kind, reaching an average of $5,000, many times less than estimated sums a decade earlier. Putting this together yields a bleak financial picture for the FARC's kidnapping rings. Assuming, as Colombia's Defense Ministry does, that the FARC is involved in one-quarter of all kidnappings, their gross income from kidnapping is a paltry $350,000. Even if the group demands and receives triple the average ransom and the kidnapping rate is three times what is reported, its earnings, after expenses, would still be around one million dollars, hardly worth the time, effort and political costs of the practice. The FARC is no ordinary organization, so they may earn much more than the average kidnapping crew. But even if we assume they make ten times the estimates above, compare that with the estimated $200 million ( other estimates reach $500 to $600 million ) per year the FARC can earn by ""taxing"" drug producers or drug trafficking organizations who operate in their areas of influence, or selling coca base or processed cocaine to the traffickers, and you can understand why kidnapping has become more of a hassle than an earner. Colombians' skepticism regarding the FARC's sudden change in tactics is warranted, but it could be that the group is simply employing a cold economic calculus to the issue. *Additional reporting provided by Andres Ortiz Sedano.

"Anniversary of Migrant Massacre in Mexico Brings Few Answers. One year after the massacre of 72 migrants in Tamaulipas, north Mexico, none of the killers have been brought to justice. Tying up the loose ends in the story means understanding how and why the migrants became targets. On August 23, 2010, a wounded man approached a security checkpoint close to the town of San Fernando, in the state of Tamaulipas, 160 kilometers from the U.S. border. He had been shot through the jaw, and told troops he was the survivor of a mass killing on a nearby ranch. Navy troops approached the property, exchanging fire with criminals, and found 72 bodies lying in a heap in an outside storehouse. One year later, the facts of what happened at the ranch that day are not much clearer. The dead were migrants from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Ecuador, and Brazil, making their way to the U.S. border. They were killed execution-style, with one or two shots to each victim. Details emerged of at least one other survivor , while the wounded man who first raised the alarm, an Ecuadorean, told the authorities that there had been a total of 76 people traveling together, all of whom were killed. Initial reports said that the Zetas drug gang had kidnapped the group from the highway, slaughtering them when they refused to join the organization. But, as InSight Crime has pointed out , this seems unlikely. There is little reason to think the Zetas are desperate enough to resort to this kind of forced recruitment. Likewise, the idea that the migrants were killed after being mistaken for reinforcements for another drug gang does not hold water, as they were all, or mostly, foreigners and would have been clearly identifiable as migrants. While questions mounted over the killings, the body count continued to rise in Tamaulipas -- some 183 bodies were found in a series of mass graves outside San Fernando in April of this year. One NGO warned on the anniversary of the find that there are at least 500 more bodies hidden in mass graves in Tamaulipas, based on confessions from criminals. Many of these are likely migrants. The National Human Rights Commission said in 2010 that almost 10,000 migrants are kidnapped every year in Mexico. These attacks happen for different reasons. Often the migrants are the targets of kidnapping by gangs who force them to call their families and ask them to send money. Sometimes they are the unwitting victims of disputes over taxes, known as ""piso,"" which criminal gangs charge migrant smugglers, in exchange for the right to bring the human cargo through the gang's territory. One theory with the Tamaulipas massacre is that the migrants were killed because their handlers failed to pay the correct ""piso"" sum to the Zetas. Even more disturbingly, some migrants have even claimed that Mexican immigration officials themselves handed them over to kidnapping gangs. The story is not over for the relatives of the victims. Guatemala has called on the Mexican government carry out a thorough investigation into the case, and protested that it had buried 13 bodies that still remained to be identified. Relatives of Honduran victims have said that they were not allowed to see the bodies, so do not know if they were correctly identified. Mexican authorities say they have charged 81 people with taking part in the various San Fernando killings, including Edgar Huerta Montiel, alias ""El Wache,"" who has reportedly confessed to masterminding the 2010 massacre. No one has yet been sentenced. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (Comision Nacional de los Derechos Humanos - CNDH) told El Universal that it continues to investigate the Tamaulipas massacre, and accused the Attorney General's Office (PGR) of refusing to cooperate. And as the investigation drags on, abuses against migrants continue. Fresh proof was offered on August 8 when 19-year-old Guatemalan citizen, part of a peace march to protest violence against migrants, was lynched in southern Mexico. He was reportedly misidentified as a thief, and handed him to a mob by police in exchange for money. On the anniversary of the killings, local authorities in Tamaulipas announced that the army would stay at least two more years in the state to ensure security and support the police. But they have not yet managed to protect the highly vulnerable groups passing through the state. As Batista Jimenez, representative of the human rights commission, pointed out, the Tamaulipas killings represent only a sample of the attacks against migrants passing through Mexico. The Ecuadorean survivor appealed to his countrymen not to take the migrant route to the U.S. ""Don't come, there are many bad people who will not let you pass I tell all Ecuadoreans not to travel, because the Zetas are killing many people."" (See Milenio's video report, below, on the process of identifying the corpses found in the San Fernando mass graves.) "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"UN: Grave Concern About Attacks on Migrants in Mexico. The UN high commissioner for human rights warned that the situation of migrants passing through Mexico is a matter of ""grave concern,"" following recent attacks against migrants making their way to the U.S. Speaking at the opening in Geneva of the 17th Session of the Human Rights Council, High Commissioner Navi Pillay highlighted the number of cases of kidnapping and murders against migrants in Mexico. She said these were often linked to organized crime networks, reports El Universal. The commissioner will travel to Mexico in June, where she will discuss the problem with government officials. Pillay's comments come weeks after a group of migrants accused Mexican immigration officials of having handed them over to the Gulf Cartel , which held them hostage in houses close to the U.S. border.

Mexico Police Rescue 7 Kidnap Victims. Soldiers rescued seven kidnap victims who were being driven in a van through the streets of Monterrey, north Mexico. In the vehicle, the authorities also found the body of a man. The freed prisoners told the authorities he had been beaten to death by the captives after asking for water. The army spotted the vehicle after receiving an anonymous tip about armed men in the area , but intercepted it only after a high speed chase through the city streets. Two of the suspects managed to escape, while one was captured. Also in Nuevo Leon, the state security spokesman confirmed that 17 policemen from the municipality of Pesqueria have been detained on suspicion of taking part in a kidnapping scheme. They have been in detention since June 9 on suspicion of abducting 20 construction workers in collaboration with organized criminal groups. 	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
Anti-Drug Chief Admits Paraguay Becoming Cocaine Producer. Following recent discoveries of large scale cocaine processing laboratories in Paraguay, authorities have expressed concern that the role of the country in the regional drug trade is evolving from that of a transit nation to that of a producer country. During a June 14 interview with radio station 780 AM , Paraguay's antinarcotics chief Crispulo Sotelo voiced concern that the nation was becoming more involved in cocaine production, as indicated by a number of recent laboratory busts. In a raid in the southeastern city of Encarnacion on June 13, authorities arrested five suspects and seized drugs and precursor chemicals from a laboratory that allegedly belonged to an organization with links to Brazilian criminal group the First Capital Command ( PCC ), reported Ultima Hora. T he unfinished product was brought from Pedro Juan Caballero, near the Brazilian border, to be processed in Encarnacion, and the cocaine was then shipped by river to Argentina, according to ABC. Authorities also found 15 bags of coca leaves at the site thought to have been brought from Bolivia, in what was reportedly the first seizure of the raw material used to produce cocaine in a Paraguayan laboratory raid. Sotelo also highlighted a drug lab discovered earlier this year that allegedly produced cocaine destined for Paraguay's domestic market in the Asuncion area, reported Prensa Latina. In addition to being South America's largest marijuana producer, Paraguay has become a key transit nation for Bolivian cocaine en route to Brazilian and European markets. Recent discoveries of cocaine processing laboratories in the country show that Paraguay is now being used for drug production as well, and Sotelo's concern that this is a rising trend appears to be well-founded. At least three major cocaine processing facilities, in addition to the ones he mentioned, have been discovered over the last year and a half , along with large amounts of precursor chemicals. Meanwhile, the discovery of coca leaves in the most recent laboratory raid indicates the organizations involved are now going straight to the source, rather than trafficking in coca base to process. According to ABC, importing this primary material is legal and thus reduces the risks involved. Increasing production also could mean that criminal groups operating in Paraguay are attempting to control more links in the drug chain and keep a larger percentage of the profits. Powerful Brazilian drug trafficking organizations that operate in Paraguay and traffic drugs from Bolivia -- including the PCC and the Red Command -- could be partly behind this shift. There are also signs Paraguayan-run organizations are getting more deeply involved in the drug trade. www1.delta-search.com/?babsrc=NT_ss_SU&mntrId=7806606C666F1464&affID=119357&tsp=4974	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Guatemalan Inmates Riot, Take Guards Hostage. Inmates at a maximum security prison in Guatemala rioted for over 24 hours and took guards hostage, yet more evidence of how lax government control and poor conditions fuel violence and chaos in Latin America's penticiary systems. On the morning of November 19, the inmates of Fraijanes II prison, located on the outskirts of Guatemala City, began rioting over the maximum security facility's poor living conditions. The prisoners took eight employees hostage and shouted to journalists gathered outside that if they were not granted better food and more visitation rights, they would kill the prison workers, reported La Prensa By the morning of November 20, following negotiations with authorities, the prisoners had released all of their hostages. The interior minister told journalists that the government will conduct an investigation into conditions at the jail and into how the prisoners managed to obtain weapons. According to Siglo 21 , due to the extensive damage caused to cells during the rioting, the government has begun transferring prisoners to other facilities, including several Barrio-18 leaders and drug kingpin Horst Walther Overdick , alias ""El Tigre,"" who is awaiting extradition to the US. The riot at Fraijanes II follows a string of similar incidents both in Guatemala and throughout the region. On October 18, prisoners at a facility known as ""El Infiernito,"" or ""Little Hell,"" in southern Guatemala took nine employees hostage in order to negotiate for better conditions. Last week, inmates at Challapalca, a maximum security prison in southeastern Peru, took 14 employees hostage , also demanding improved living conditions. While these three incidents were resolved without violence, they are indicative of how the overcrowded, highly corrupt penitentiary systems of many Latin American countries can turn prisons into time bombs, as well as criminal finishing schools. According to figures from the International Center for Prison Studies , Guatemala's jails were running at 160 percent over capacity last year. One of the major problems with this overcrowding is that it has created a fertile environment for gangs to recruit new members and continue running their criminal networks from inside. Earlier this year, the prison director of El Infiernito was gunned down in Escuintla , apparently on the orders of imprisoned criminals, while gangs have also been found to run extortion networks from behind bars, some of which target large businesses in neighboring El Salvador ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexicos Queen of the Pacific Receives Light Sentence for Drug Crimes. Infamous Mexican drug trafficker the ""Queen of the Pacific"" could soon find herself walking free, after receiving a 70-month prison sentence which will be reduced further thanks to time already served; an outcome that raises questions over the use of extradition and plea bargains for drug lords. Sandra Avila Beltran received the sentence after pleading guilty to being ""an accessory after the fact"" by aiding her drug trafficking lover. She had previously denied all charges but later cut a deal with prosecutors, admitting the lesser charge in exchange for a sentence reduction. Avila was arrested in 2007, and as her time already spent in prison is to be deducted, she has essentially already served her sentence and will now be processed and deported to Mexico, where she faces no outstanding charges and will remain free. The sentencing ends a long-running legal saga, which has seen Avila acquitted of organized crime charges in Mexico and fight, and eventually lose, a convoluted legal struggle against extradition to the US. Avila was accused of being a key link in the drug trafficking chain that connected Colombia's Norte del Valle Cartel and Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. She was initially accused of conspiring with her boyfriend, Colombian trafficker Juan Diego Espinosa Ramirez, alias ""El Tigre,"" to transport nine tons of cocaine. The tortured legal process in Avila's case highlights weaknesses in both the Mexican and the US legal systems. Within the country, Avila was able to defeat numerous attempts to convict her of serious charges, and came close to avoiding extradition. However, once in the United States, her cooperation with the authorities led to a minimal sentence for a person long linked to the upper echelons of Latin American organized crime. The case also raises issues around extradition, which increased exponentially under Mexico's previous president, Felipe Calderon. As Avila's case demonstrates, the opportunity to cut a deal and receive short sentences in the United States means extradition often does not hold the same fear for drug traffickers as it did in the past. This has especially been the case in Colombia, where extradition has a long and polemical history but now appears to be viewed as a softer option by many drug traffickers, and has even been publically questioned by the government."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Op-ed: The Challenges of Studying Mexicos Progress Towards Peace. For those of us preoccupied with the study of crime in Mexico, there is one great frustration. That official statistics are often unreliable and sometimes by design. It presents a monumental challenge, especially when we are accumulating the data for the 2016 Mexico Peace Index, released today, which provides a comprehensive measure of levels of violence in the country from 2003 to 2015. So how do we know when official statistics are wrong? At the Institute for Economics and Peace we took the homicide numbers as recorded by the police and compared them to the numbers of death certificates certified by medical professionals that list murder as the cause of death. In doing so, we found that homicide victims have been undercounted by law enforcement agencies by more than 20 percent in 11 Mexican states. They are troubling figures. This is an op-ed by Steve Killelea, chairman and founder of the Institute for Economics and Peace , which publishes the Mexico Peace Index. It does but not necessarily reflect the views of InSight Crime. See our take on the index here. In 2014, every Mexican state had at least a small discrepancy between police and medical data sources. Some amount of difference is to be expected, as some of the cases investigated by police may have been found to not be homicides upon review by a coroner, but the sizes of some of the gaps raise concerns about the veracity of data provided by law enforcement agencies. In the state of Veracruz, for example, only 63.9 percent of the homicide victims recorded in death certificates in 2014 were the subject of police homicide investigations. In addition, during our research we found that only around 10 percent of extortions, 17 percent of rapes and 32 percent of kidnappings are reported to authorities. Disappearances are a problem in Mexico as well, with accounts of the discoveries of mass graves, such as those in Guerrero, and loved ones searching for their missing. The official numbers say that more than 26,000 people are known to have gone missing in Mexico since 2007, which is incomplete. That figure only represents the people who are currently missing, it does not represent the total number of all the people who have gone missing in that time given that some have reappeared or been found dead. In our in-depth analysis on disappearances in Mexico, we can see that the majority of the people reported and currently missing are male youths, and are often working class men with families. Their disappearances, while tragic in themselves, can have a serious impact on the financial circumstances of extended families. Corruption is an issue in Mexico and its manifestations and extent vary from state to state, leading in some cases to underreporting of data. There has been a problematic relationship between organized crime, some government operations and law enforcement in Mexico since at least the 1990s, leading to its place at the lowest ranking on the Corruption Perceptions Index of any OECD country. This raises concerns that law enforcement agencies may not be investigating all cases or that official agencies could be deliberately underreporting the level of crime within jurisdictions in order to appear more efficient and lawful. Meanwhile, 60 percent of victims, when surveyed and asked why they didn't report a crime to the authorities, said it was due to the performance of government agencies. Changes are underway, however. Mexico is investing in police, judicial and penal system reforms, including the New Criminal Justice System (NSJP), the implementation deadline for which is in June 2016. This will allow defendants to challenge prosecution evidence more effectively, and should reduce trial times, sometimes by years. It will also establish the presumption of innocence to accused parties, guarantee their right to a licensed public defender, and prohibit torture, intimidation and incommunicado detention. As of March 2014, the public security secretariat has also been required by law to publish victim counts for the investigations into homicide, kidnapping and extortion, a requirement that represents an advancement in efforts towards transparency. In the meantime, how do we compensate for the poor quality of the official figures? IEP's analysis takes into account a number of sources, public surveys and the wisdom of an expert panel, and adjusts government data to account for underreporting. It's with this depth of scrutiny that the latest edition presents a cautiously optimistic picture for the future of peace in Mexico, although efforts need to be made to strengthen the capacity of government agencies, including in their recording of crime statistics. Accurate data is important. Because with it can come an understanding of the scale of problems, the policies that work, the trends, patterns and drivers of peace. All of which can allow a society to gain the wisdom needed to implement a long-lasting and meaningful peace. *Steve Killelea is the c hairman and founder of the Institute for Economics and Peace , which publishes the Mexico Peace Index.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Honduras Congress Mounts Legal Attack Against Anti-Graft Body. Lawmakers in Honduras are backing a legal attack aimed at undermining the country's internationally-supported anti-corruption body by declaring its creation unconstitutional, a move that could derail ongoing anti-graft probes. Honduras' Congress released a legal analysis on May 29 calling for the suspension of the internationally-backed Support Mission Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (Mision de Apoyo contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad en Honduras - MACCIH) based on the ""unconstitutionality"" of its creation. According to the congressional analysis, the 2016 agreement to create the MACCIH, which was signed by Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and the Organization of American States (OAS), violates the Honduran constitution by interfering with ""national sovereignty"" and the ""autonomy and independence"" of the country's institutions. The document serves as support in a case currently under consideration by the country's Supreme Court. In early March, lawyers representing several members of Congress implicated in the MACCIH's anti-graft probes submitted a complaint to the court with the same legal argument about the unconstitutionality of the MACCIH's mandate. The Supreme Court has not yet made a decision in the case, but media reports in Honduras suggest that the court may chip away at parts of the MACCIH by declaring the creation of the body's investigative arm within the Attorney General's Office unconstitutional. As corrupt officials in Honduras continue to step up efforts to derail anti-graft probes, the recent legal arguments over the MACCIH's constitutionality could potentially lead to the dismantling or weakening of the body, casting a dark cloud over the future of the fight against corruption. Eric Olson, the director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Latin American program, told InSight Crime it would be ""a devastating blow"" if the Supreme Court rules that part or all of the MACCIH's mandate is unconstitutional. According to Olson, the ""risks are enormous"" for such a decision by the court, which is packed with allies of President Hernandez, who himself faces allegations of corruption. Olsen warned that a ruling against the MACCIH could throw further doubt on ""what the motivations are"" and worsen the ""lack of confidence in Honduras' judicial system."" In particular, the attacks on the MACCIH's investigative arm are ""very troubling,"" Olson said, because they could result in the body being stripped down into a ""pretty toothless institution without much capacity,"" even if the mission isn't halted entirely. Christine Wade, a Central America expert and political science professor at Washington College, told InSight Crime that although the MACCIH's mandate has been weak from the start, absent its presence, it's unlikely that Honduras' anti-corruption investigations will continue. ""There is very little political will or institutional capacity to deal with corruption in Honduras. The political elite, starting at the very top, have very little appetite for investigating themselves,"" Wade said. Even if this latest attempt to undermine and derail the probes is unsuccessful, Olson and Wade agree that the campaign to defang investigative bodies will find a different path. ""Those in Honduras who have something to fear from an independent justice system will continue to attack it as many ways as they can. This is one avenue, but there are other avenues,"" Olson said."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Walled Inside Homes, Corpses of Mexicos Disappeared Evade Authorities. Forensic examiners recovering bodies from mass graves in remote terrain has become commonplace during Mexico's drug war, but criminal groups in Jalisco are making authorities' jobs increasingly difficult by hiding corpses inside residential homes. Just outside Jalisco's capital of Guadalajara, the body count in a mass grave found underneath the patio of a house on July 21 has increased to 21 after authorities initially uncovered 12 bodies and 11 bags with human remains, AFP reported. The grisly scene was discovered after federal police forces, during a routine patrol, observed an armed man outside of what appeared to be a safe house in the municipality of Tonala. The man fled upon seeing police and left the door wide open. Authorities initially found three dead bodies with their hands bound and faces covered before discovering the other bodies and human remains, according to AFP. In May, authorities uncovered the human remains of at least 34 individuals at two properties in western Jalisco, the home state of the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion -- CJNG), one of Mexico's most dominant criminal groups. The Pacific state of Jalisco has one of the highest numbers of bodies recovered from mass graves in recent years, according to government data. So far in 2019, the state's Attorney General's Office has located at least 13 clandestine graves and uncovered more than 70 bodies -- though there could be many more, according to an investigation from Zona Docs. Between 2009 and 2014, state authorities uncovered 53 clandestine graves and exhumed 152 bodies from such sites -- second only to southwest Guerrero state during that time, a recent report from the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights (Comision Mexicana de Defensa y Promocion de los Derechos Humanos - CMDPDH) found. The backbreaking task of discovering and exploring Mexico's many clandestine graves has often fallen on the shoulders of families and loved ones of the disappeared, as well as non-governmental organizations that assist in the process. Criminal actors regularly bury victims in vast stretches of land in remote regions, at times with the complicity of authorities. While searchers can access these wide-open areas, the task of finding the disappeared in Jalisco has become even more challenging as criminal actors instead use residential homes as burial grounds. While indeed a daunting task, the Mexican government has long struggled to determine the fate of some 40,000 disappeared individuals throughout the country, according to government data. ""It's more difficult [when graves are in residential areas] because they are private property and we have to go through legal procedures to dig There are places where there is cement and you have to get a backhoe it's much more complicated than if you go to an open field,"" Guadalupe Aguilar, a member of the Families United for Our Missing in Jalisco organization, told Zona Docs. For authorities, this means having to gather sufficient evidence to obtain probable cause or a search warrant in order to gain access to houses or properties where some of the disappeared may be buried. Such tactics are not exclusive to just the state of Jalisco. In northwest Chihuahua state, for example, authorities have also uncovered clandestine graves hidden in safe houses. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to tackle Mexico's crisis of disappearances and mass graves in part by reinstating a national search system and allocating unlimited resources to the program. But this is not happening swiftly enough for loved ones who often spend years searching for their missing relatives. These efforts may be prolonged much further if Mexico's most brazen criminal actors continue to use residential properties to hide the bodies of their victims."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Italy-Panama Cocaine Network Reveals Mafias Use of Elite Connections. An international drug trafficking case involving an export company in Panama and the 'Ndrangheta mafia provides the latest example of the Italian criminal group's spread throughout Latin America and illustrates their use of contacts in the region's business and political elite. According to an investigation published by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on June 18, the Panamanian export company collaborated with well-connected members of Italy's elite to smuggle cocaine from Colombia and Peru to the United States and Calabria, Italy in fish shipments. At the height of its operations, the Panamanian business allegedly smuggled 680 kilos of cocaine a month inside shark and tuna fillets. Once on Italian soil, the drugs passed into the hands of the 'Ndrangheta mafia. A series of e-mails also implicate Italian national Valter Lavitola, an entrepreneur who is currently on trial for corruption and extortion, and who allegedly has strong ties with current and former heads of state in the region, including Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli. The owner of the Panamanian company also appears to have high-level connections. According to Corriere della Sera, his wife worked as an assistant to a government minister and his brother owned a security company that had been awarded major public contracts. Although Italian mafias have done business in Latin America since at least the 1990s, a series of recent arrests suggest they are attempting to increase their foothold in the region, maximizing on a growing cocaine market in Europe to establish operations throughout the Americas. The 'Ndrangheta mafia -- considered Italy's most powerful criminal organization -- facilitates drug shipments to Italy from countries throughout the region including Colombia , Mexico , Peru and the Dominican Republic. The most recent case in Panama suggests the 'Ndrangheta are facilitating their cocaine trafficking with contacts among the political and business elite not only in Italy but also in Latin America. Panama's strategic location near Colombia and its canal -- through which an estimated 11 million containers pass each year -- makes it an attractive transshipment point for drug traffickers and a logical choice for 'Ndrangheta operations.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"US Party Platforms Address Hemispheric Drug Trade. Both of the major political parties in the United States have incorporated language addressing drug trafficking and transnational crime in their platforms, but there seems to be very little new proposals from either side. On September 4, the US Democratic Party kicked off its convention ahead of the November elections, meeting to shore up support for President Barack Obama and officially ratify the party platform for the next four years. While drug trafficking and organized crime in the Americas is far from the main issue on the table at the convention, the 2012 Democratic National Platform includes some surprising references to transnational crime in the hemisphere. In fact, the issue made up the vast majority of the platform's section on foreign policy towards the Americas. The section begins by praising the Obama's accomplishments in strengthening ties with Mexico, Colombia, and Central American countries to combat drug trafficking, and then promises to deepen this work, claiming: As we collectively confront these challenges, we will continue to support the region's security forces, border security, and police with the equipment, training, and technologies they need to keep their communities safe. We will improve coordination and share more information so that those who traffic in drugs and in human beings have fewer places to hide. And we will continue to put unprecedented pressure on cartel finances, including in the United States. The Republican party's platform , approved a week earlier in Tampa, Florida, also mentions the regional drug trade. In it, the party claims that the ""The war on drugs and the war on terror have become a single enterprise,"" and acknowledges the efforts of the governments of Mexico and Canada to fight this threat. The platform also calls for ""[A] unified effort on crime and terrorism to coordinate intelligence and enforcement among our regional allies, as well as military-to-military training and intelligence sharing with Mexico, whose people are bearing the brunt of the drug cartels' savage assault."" Despite the two parties' differences in ideology, their platforms on combating drug trafficking abroad appears to be more or less the same. This is likely good news for countries in the region which depend on the US government for funding of much of their counternarcotics programs, as it guarantees that much-needed security aid will continue more or less unchanged regardless of the outcome in November. However, it should be noted that both platforms clash with changing attitudes towards the US-led ""war on drugs"" in the hemisphere. As InSight Crime noted at the time, drug policy was one of the top issues at April's Summit of the Americas. Several Latin American governments, led by Colombia and Guatemala, two countries which have been hard hit by the drug trade's violence, used the summit to express openness to legalizing or decriminalizing certain drugs deemed less harmful. Ultimately this is a sign that if the US continues to advocate for military-heavy approaches to drug trafficking in the region, it may find itself facing stronger opposition from its partners in the region."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Comparing Presidential Corruption Scandals in Guatemala and Brazil: Part 1. Over the past several years, both Brazil and Guatemala have been rocked by revelations of widespread corruption at the highest levels of government. Former presidents in both countries are now standing trial for their alleged roles in the respective scandals. InSight Crime explores some of the similarities and differences between these cases. In addition to reporting by InSight Crime and other outlets, this article also draws on a discussion InSight Crime moderated recently between Mike Allison , an expert on Central American politics who serves as an associate professor and chair of the political science department at the University of Scranton, and Matthew Taylor , an associate professor at American University's School of International Service who focuses on state capacity and corruption in Latin America and who has extensive experience in Brazil. An edited transcript of that conversation has been published here. Who was involved? Guatemala: Former Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina and former Vice President Roxana Baldetti were accused in June 2016 by the United Nations-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG ) of leading a ""criminal mafia structure that had co-opted power through the ballot box."" The criminal network also allegedly included Baldetti's private secretary Juan Carlos Monzon as a key intermediary, as well as numerous other government officials and business elites. Brazil: The cast of characters in the Brazilian case bears a striking resemblance to the Guatemalan one. Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio ""Lula"" da Silva was accused in September 2016 by prosecutors in the South American country of ""setting up and controlling an illegal schemeto buy partisan support in Congress and thus ensure the perpetuation of his party in power."" In March 2016, Lula's former chief of staff Jose Dirceu was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison for his role in the scandal. Involvement in this scheme also allegedly extended to a slew of politicians including current president Michel Temer as well as private business elites and executives of state companies, particularly the government-run oil giant Petrobras. How did the schemes work? Guatemala: After losing a bid for the presidency in 2007, Perez Molina and Baldetti allegedly set up a network of front companies that accepted and laundered illicit campaign funds from prospective state contractors, which helped finance their successful 2011 run for office. Once in power, investigators say Perez Molina and Baldetti rewarded these contributors with state contracts, some of which were used to fund kickbacks to the president and vice president. This case became known as the ""Cooptacion del Estado,"" or ""Cooptation of the State."" But the ""cooptation"" case was not the only corruption scheme in which Perez Molina and Baldetti were allegedly involved. Other investigations have resulted in at least three additional sets of accusations against the former president and vice president. One of these plots, known as ""La Linea,"" involved companies paying bribes to customs officials in exchange for help avoiding import taxes; Perez Molina and Baldetti allegedly received a percentage of those bribes. Another scandal involved allegations that Perez Molina accepted bribes from a Spanish company in exchange for help obtaining a contract for upgrading a major shipping terminal, the Quetzal Port. Shortly after the ""cooptation"" case broke, the Attorney General's Office described yet another corruption scheme dubbed "" Cooperacha ,"" or ""Kick-in,"" in which Perez Molina and Baldetti allegedly received gifts purchased by government employees with state funds. Attorney General Thelma Aldana said the purchases were made ""with the intention of 'pleasing the boss,' much like the practice of [members of] organized crime structures that guarantees their position within the hierarchy and their license to operate."" Following the revelation of the ""cooptation"" case, CICIG head Ivan Velasquez said the evidence uncovered by the investigations indicated the existence of "" structural corruption "" in Guatemala, involving ""consolidated structures"" that could ""reach relationships and understandings with each government."" InSight Crime spoke with a source in CICIG who asked not to be identified, who described illicit campaign funding as ""the original sin"" by which powerful actors ""substitute the public interest for the interests of certain elites who finance the campaign."" In other words, political and business elites created illicit networks that served the dual purpose of keeping each other in power while siphoning off government resources for their own personal enrichment. Brazil: Prosecutors in Brazil allege that Lula was at the ""vertex of various criminal schemes"" aimed at keeping the political party he founded, the Worker's Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores - PT), in control of the levers of government. The September 2016 indictment of Lula described two separate alleged corruption schemes as ""sides of the same coin."" The first scheme, known as the ""Mensalao,"" or ""big monthly payment,"" came to light in 2005 during Lula's first term as president. In this case, prosecutors alleged that public funds were used to make illegal payments to members of Congress in return for political favors. More than two dozen politicians and businessmen, including Lula's chief of staff Dirceu, were convicted of involvement in the scandal, but the president himself was not directly implicated at the time. The other ""side of the coin,"" according to prosecutors, was a corruption scandal that broke in 2014 primarily revolving around the state oil company Petrobras. At first, the investigations focused on accusations that Petrobras executives had awarded public works contracts to private companies at inflated prices in exchange for kickbacks, some of which were funneled into political campaigns. More recently, however, prosecutors have accused Lula of using his position as president from 2003 to 2010 to appoint participants in the corruption scheme to important government positions. There, they could accept bribes for their own personal enrichment, while funneling some of the money into a ""general fund"" for buying political favors and covering the costs of disguising its illicit origin. Using a phrase similar to the one used by CICIG's Velasquez, the judge in charge of the Petrobras case, Sergio Moro, has described the scandal as an example of "" systemic corruption "" in Brazil. However, there are a few key differences between Guatemala's ""cooptation"" case and the Petrobras scandal. For one, the bribery in the Brazilian case appears to be more closely linked to political incentives than the desire for personal enrichment on the part of the participants, though the latter certainly played an important role. As the Washington Post explains , Brazil's fractured political party system makes it difficult to form governing coalitions to pass legislation. One solution to this problem -- which was apparently applied in this case -- is to offer illicit payments to members of Congress in exchange for their votes. In Guatemala, on the other hand, the evidence suggests personal enrichment trumped political expediency as the primary motivation for the graft. Another key difference between the two corruption cases is who benefitted, and how. Brazilian prosecutors allege that Lula received upwards of $1 million in free construction work on a luxury apartment connected to one construction firm involved in the Petrobras scandal. He is also accused of accepting speaking fees from another construction firm in exchange for helping the company obtain contracts and financing. But unlike in the Guatemala case, the former president is not accused of personally taking a cut of a multitude of graft schemes occurring at various levels of government. This suggests that the corruption in Brazil took place in a much more decentralized fashion than in Guatemala, where Perez Molina and Baldetti appear to have acted like mafia bosses, personally taking a cut of each of the numerous illegal activities occurring under their direction. What is the outlook? Guatemala: The charges against Perez Molina, Baldetti and others accused of involvement in Guatemala's recent graft scandals came after a years-long struggle to establish a mechanism for dealing with the influence wielded by corrupt, clandestine networks of elites in Guatemalan politics. This process eventually resulted in the formation of CICIG. As InSight Crime has extensively reported , CICIG has a long and complicated history that is still being written. Nevertheless, it is clear that the investigation and prosecution of the former president and vice president have had far-reaching implications for Guatemalan politics and society. One of the most profound impacts of the revelation of the various corruption schemes was the resignation of Perez Molina in September 2015. The fact that the president was forced to step down and was soon jailed for his alleged involvement in the graft clearly signaled the diminishing power of these illicit networks as well as citizens' declining tolerance for corruption. Even before his resignation, the growing public pressure for strong anti-corruption efforts led Perez Molina to renew CICIG's mandate -- a decision that somewhat ironically contributed to his downfall. In the October 2015 presidential election, Guatemalans reiterated their concern with government corruption by rejecting several candidates dogged by allegations of graft and instead choosing Jimmy Morales, a comedian with almost no political experience who ran with the campaign slogan ""not corrupt, not a thief."" Morales has subsequently requested the renewal of CICIG's mandate and expressed support for continuing anti-corruption efforts, even as some of his close family members face accusations of corrupt behavior. The recent scandals appear to have marred the reputation Guatemala's armed forces and political elites, while CICIG has become the most trusted institution in the country. At the same time, however, the ongoing efforts by CICIG and Guatemalan authorities to combat corruption are not universally popular. In June, Guatemala Attorney General Thelma Aldana publicly stated that ""hidden powers that proliferate in the country"" were attempting to undermine her office's efforts to prosecute elites like Perez Molina and Baldetti. And while the ongoing prosecutions serve as signs of progress for the country's judiciary when it comes to fighting corruption, it remains unclear how successful these efforts will be in the long run; past political corruption cases have often ended with mixed results from the perspective of anti-corruption advocates. Brazil: Like Guatemala, Brazil has a long history of struggling to deal with widespread government corruption. The above-mentioned Mensalao scandal brought the issue of political graft to the fore, and subsequent revelations of deep-seated corruption fueled calls for greater efforts to clean up the country's political scene. The Petrobras scandal seems to have touched a particular nerve with the Brazilian public, sparking a series of anti-corruption protests that have brought hundreds of thousands of citizens into the street in recent years. Recent public opinion surveys show that more Brazilians than ever consider corruption the biggest problem facing their country. And as in Guatemala, the revelations appear to have contributed to a declining confidence in institutions. According to the most recent Latinobarometro survey , Brazilians have some of the lowest rates of confidence in government of any country in Latin America. Indeed, the Petrobras scandal has seen quite a few elites jailed for their alleged involvement in the graft. Some have even described the judge handling the Petrobras case as a ""hero"" for overseeing the successful prosecution of numerous powerful suspects in the scheme. However, the long-term impact of these actions seems even less clear in the Brazilian case than in the Guatemalan one. The investigations and prosecutions thus far have faced several criticisms, most notably that they have become politicized , focusing mostly on former President Lula and his Workers' Party. And while the probe has targeted several powerful figures, many have been able to significantly reduce their prison sentences by entering into plea bargains. Moreover, it has proven difficult to prosecute sitting politicians due to the immunity they enjoy under Brazilian law. Still, as judge Moro put it , the Petrobras case has shown that ""much can be done even under the current system, as long as the problem is confronted and treated with seriousness."" It is impossible to completely eliminate government graft, especially when it has become a deeply ingrained feature of the political system. But investigating and prosecuting corruption when it occurs is a crucial first step towards addressing the issue. In Brazil as in Guatemala, it is too soon to definitively assess the ultimate impact of these ongoing cases, though it does seem clear that business executives and politicians in those countries are now likely to think twice before offering or accepting bribe payments. But the most profound effect of these cases may be the lessons they provide for other countries struggling with government corruption. Several governments across the region, including Mexico , El Salvador , Honduras and Peru , have established anti-corruption bodies or passed anti-graft laws in recent months. The outcome of such efforts may hinge, at least in part, on their ability to draw on the successes -- and failures -- of the Brazilian and Guatemalan examples."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Costa Rica Busts Drug Trafficking Ring. The recent bust of a cocaine trafficking ring in Costa Rica highlights how smaller, independent operators are moving into the transnational drug trade, as the Central American country remains an important transit hub for cocaine moving northwards. On February 11, Costa Rican anti-drug police arrested eight members of a drug trafficking and money laundering ring, reported La Nacion. Seven of those detained were Costa Rican nationals and the eighth was a Nicaraguan citizen, reported AFP. The group's leader -- a semi-truck driver whose last name is Fonseca Vega -- was among those arrested. Investigations revealed that the group received cocaine shipments from Panama and Colombia, hid the drugs in special compartments built into semi-trucks, and transported them to Honduras and Guatemala. The vehicles then returned to Costa Rica carrying cash. During the course of the investigation, which began in August 2013, police seized 767 kilos of cocaine and $440,000 in cash. Seven other members of the organization, including six drivers and one individual who helped move the cash shipments, were arrested in previous operations. This bust highlights how small-scale, independent drug trafficking organizations have increased space to operate in Central America. As many of the big drug cartels have been weakened by law enforcement operations and internal conflict, more opportunities are opening up for smaller groups to participate in the transnational drug trade. This is a phenomenon that has been seen in Mexico, where the larger cartels have splintered and smaller groups now control some aspects of drug production and transport. Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala are also home to independent transport groups -- known as ""transportistas"" -- who do not appear to be allied to one particular drug cartel. These recent arrests in Costa Rica are also indicative of growing local involvement in the drug trade as the country's importance as a cocaine transit nation increases. Between 2006 and 2010, the number of local drug trafficking groups dismantled by Costa Rican authorities increased from 47 to 104 , and in 2013 authorities detained members of what was reportedly the country's first transnational drug trafficking organization. Last year, Costa Rica seized around 4.1 tons of cocaine in three separate operations -- the largest haul in the country's history -- on Costa Rican fishing boats."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexicos Peace Movement Suffers 3rd Killing, as Activist Found Dead. An activist with Javier Sicilia's Movement for Peace has been found dead, with signs of torture, close to his home in Michoacan, west Mexico. Less than 24 hours after he was reported missing, the badly beaten body of Jose Trinidad de la Cruz Crisoforo , a peace activist in his seventies, was found near the town of Aquila in Michoacan state. According to authorities, the corpse bore signs of torture. De la Cruz was found with his hands tied behind his back and at least four bullet wounds, and his left ear was almost detached. Other activists told press that de la Cruz had been beaten and threatened with death in June. As a result of this intimidation he left his home, but returned in October. De la Cruz is the third member of the Movement for Peace to be assassinated in recent months. Pedro Leyva Dominguez was murdered in October, and prominent activist Nepomuceno Moreno Nunez, known as ""Don Nepo,"" was murdered in the northwestern state of Sonora in November. Clara Judsiman, a spokesperson for the movement, said that the death of the three activists and the recent kidnappings of two others are part of a ""strategy of intimidation to silence human rights defenders."" The Movement for Peace, led by poet Javier Sicila, has gained increasing prominence in recent months. The movement organizes large-scale protest marches across Mexico, calling for an end to gang violence and reform of the government's methods in the fight against organized crime. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Failure to Protect Witnesses Fuels Impunity in Honduras. Prosecutors in Honduras have launched a scathing broadside against the state's inability to protect witnesses in criminal cases -- a key but often overlooked factor contributing to the sky-high impunity levels that have exacerbated the country's security crisis. The president of the Association of Honduran Prosecutors (AFH), Santiago Rene Moncada, slammed both the legislation and the government body designed to protect witnesses, telling El Heraldo they were not fit for purpose. Moncada -- who described how he had personally taken a witnesses in for protection only for them to be murdered hours after police arrested the suspect in the case -- called for the Witness Protection Unit to be strengthened with personnel specially trained in security procedures. The prosecutors' criticisms were echoed by the co-founder of the prominent justice reform non-governmental organization, the Association for a more Just Society ( ASJ ), Carlos Hernandez. Hernandez told El Heraldo that while the Witness Protection Law was adequate, the implementation was sorely lacking, with judicial bodies commonly putting witnesses in danger. Sources from Honduras Public Ministry consulted by El Heraldo denied any witnesses participating in the protection program had been recently murdered, but one source said some had been killed after voluntarily leaving the program. The source added that other witnesses had been recently murdered, but technically they were not participating in the witness protection program. Protecting witnesses is a key aspect of prosecuting organized crime cases anywhere, but especially in countries such as Honduras, which often lack the technical capacity to gather evidence through other means, such as electronic surveillance or DNA testing, and depend on the witnesses to make their cases. The inability to protect witnesses can not only scupper individual cases, it also contributes to a broader culture of impunity by discouraging potential witnesses, or those who would like to file police reports, from coming forward. This situation is exacerbated by low confidence levels in security and justice institutions due to corruption and links to organized crime. While much media and government attention focuses on police reform in Honduras , the lack of witness protection highlights the need for a more integrated approach. No matter how clean and effective the police are, if arrests do not lead to prosecutions and convictions the country's dire track record on impunity, and its security crisis are likely to continue.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Red Command Ships 1 Ton of Cocaine Monthly from Paraguay. Brazilian drug gang the Red Command sends a ton of Colombian cocaine each month into Brazil from Paraguay, according to Paraguayan authorities. The Red Command (Comando Vermelho) has a branch based in Paraguayan border city Ciudad del Este, and transports most of its product to Rio de Janeiro, Paraguay's anti-drug agency SENAD told Paraguayan newspaper ABC. The Red Command's top men in Paraguay are believed to be Nelson Teofilo Martinez Mendoza, who was captured by the authorities last week in the border state of Alto Parana, and Nestor Baez Alvarenga, who remains at large. According to ABC, the Red Command set up its base of operations in Ciudad del Este in the mid-1990s, in order to move shipments of Bolivian drugs to Brazil. The group initially had little infrastructure, and the leaders would transport the drugs themselves overland in SUVs, but it has since expanded to become a powerful trafficking structure in the country. The Red Command, Brazil's oldest drug trafficking organization, has historic links with Colombian trafficking groups, and became their main local partner when Brazil emerged as an important drug market and transshipment point in the 1980s. The Red Command's leader Luiz Fernando da Costa, alias ""Fernandinho Beira-Mar,"" was captured in Colombia in 2001 while buying cocaine from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). However it is likely that the group is using Bolivia as its principal cocaine supplier, as security advances in Colombia have made the country a less comfortable operating zone for criminal groups, and there has been evidence of serious Brazilian presence in Bolivia in recent years. Paraguay is a good transshipment point for drugs coming from either of these countries, thanks to its relatively weak law enforcement and location in the heart of the continent. Brazil's appetite for cocaine has grown significantly in the last decade, and it now presents a more attractive market than the United States, because of its proximity to drug-producing countries and long, permeable land borders."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Queen of the Pacific Becomes Botox Queen. Authorities have fired a prison director for allowing an alleged female Mexican drug trafficker, known as 'The Queen of the Pacific,' to undergo plastic surgery while in jail. This is only the latest incident of Mexican capos receiving luxury benefits in prison. The director of the Santa Martha Acatitla woman's prison apparently allowed Avila Beltran, who was reportedly once a key link between the Sinaloa Cartel and Colombia's Norte del Valle Cartel, to receive botox injections, reports Cronica. Initial media reports said Avila Beltran had also undergone liposuction and a nose job. Avila Beltran was arrested in 2007, charged with trafficking drugs, laundering money and, unofficially, serving as the head of ""public relations"" for the Sinaloa Cartel. A Mexican federal court cleared her of drug trafficking charges in December but she is still facing an extradition order in the U.S. Since her arrest, she has frequently been singled out as a symbol of female prominence in a field dominated by men. Much of Avila Beltran's ascent was related to family ties and romantic connections. She is the niece of Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, alias 'The Godfather,' one of the first Sinaloan traffickers to rise to fame. Both of her husbands were corrupt police commanders killed in drug-related hits. She has been romantically tied to Ismael Zambada Garcia , alias 'El Mayo,' and Colombian trafficker Juan Diego Espinoza Ramirez, who also served as a pointman between the Colombian cartels and the Sinaloans. Women do in fact make up an important part of the drug trafficking chain. According to the National Women's Institute , known by its Spanish acronym Inmujeres, the number of females imprisoned for links to the drug trade rose 400 percent between 2007 and 2010. The Institute says that many of those working-class, single mothers worked as drug mules, often helping a man in their lives: a son, partner or husband. Women play another important role in the drug trade, in that they are frequently targeted in revenge hits, including executions, rape, beheadings and hangings. The number of women killed in drug-related hits has also risen 600 percent, with over 650 executions registered last year, according to La Jornada , which cites statistics from the National Security Cabinet. This is still a small fraction of the 15,273 narco killings reported in 2010. But it is an indication that women across Mexico are increasingly transporting drugs, selling drugs and being killed for drugs, in low-profile ways that do not appear as ""glamorous"" as Beltran Avila's lifestyle but is worth more attention and concern. As the botox incident demonstrates, much of the attention fixated on Avila Beltran has to do with her ""charm"" and ""beauty"" and "" spiked heels and skintight jeans ."" By laundering millions of drug dollars in real estate and businesses and allegedly developing key political contacts in Mexico, she did in fact occupy a position of influence within the Sinaloa Cartel. In that sense, part of her mystique was her ability to raise questions about gender roles and female empowerment in the criminal world. But while Avila Beltran appeared to occupy a position of agency in a business where women are dominated and victimized by men, she was also singled out by the Mexican and international media essentially because of her social class, her elite family history, and her lovers. Meanwhile, working-class women without Avila's high-level connections remain a key part of the drug trade, performing (and subverting) traditional gender roles every day. Other supposed ""godmothers"" in the history of drug trafficking have included Enedina Arellano Felix of the Tijuana Cartel and Colombian trafficker Griselda Blanco, who, as described by Ron Chepesiuk in ""Drug Lords: the Rise and Fall of the Cali Cartel,"" in the 1970's ""became one of the first Colombian gangsters to see the potential of the drug trade, and she began to build a cocaine pipeline between Colombia and the cities of Miami and New York.""

"Rios Militias: Fighting Crimes or Committing Them?A Brazilian militia's invasion of hundreds of government apartments in Rio, which it then sold on, is another sign of how these vigilante groups seem more interested in committing crimes than in fighting them. The Justice League's (Liga da Justica) takeover of government housing units in a poor neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro is the latest example of organized criminal activity on the part of these organizations. In May, local news reported that the ""milicia,"" or militia group, was collecting ""security"" from about 10,000 residents in over 2,000 apartments, all part of the popular federal program known as, ""My House, My Life."" Even worse, according to the report, the Justice League occupied and then sold more than half of the 262 apartments in the complex, charging between $5,000 and $40,000 for each one. Some 70 people who had been assigned those houses by the government were prevented from moving in. Many of these families, who got the apartments because authorities said their houses were at risk of collapsing in the rain, had to return to their former homes. The government has stepped in, but the present residents do not want to leave , and the new families do not want to take the apartments because they fear militia retaliation. For their part, the Justice League continues to extort local residents throughout the housing complex to ""protect"" them against drug gangs, the reports say. The dominance of militias in large areas of Rio is no longer new or a secret. These groups were formed largely by ex-cops and police to push out drug pushers and traffickers. They were initially popular because they entered criminal territory, especially places where the government had no solid presence or ability to fight the criminal gangs. But what began as a vigilante movement has quickly turned into a criminal enterprise with deep ties to security forces and politicians alike. Indeed, the militias often operate in concert with Rio's Military Police. These police forces now generally enter areas first, doing an initial ""cleanse"" before the militias send in their soldiers. Once a militia has established a foothold, military police provide security rings and sweeps of the area. Militias then offer ""protection"" to the locals in exchange for weekly payments. They also supply pirate cable and Internet, provide cooking gas and transportation services. They often control the water supply, cutting it, for instance, if a resident does not pay their ""protection"" quota. In some of these areas, the new bosses seem remarkably like the old gangs, and have turned to drug trafficking as well. Groups such as the Justice League have taken over large swaths of the city. By one count, they were in one-third of Rio's favelas by 2009 , and sometimes in areas that had never previously had drug traffickers or large criminal organizations. Several militias are also very closely tied to local politicians such as Luiz Ferreira da Silva, a city councilman who was arrested earlier this year for his alleged association with a militia group in west Rio. Jailing them has had little effect. As InSight has reported , the groups regularly manage their operations from their prison cells. They seem to operate under a tacit understanding with most law enforcement that they are on the same side. In this context, the Justice League takeover of a government housing complex appears to be part of a pattern, one which shows little sign of abating. "	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"El Salvadors Truck Watchlist Adds Tool to Drug Fight. El Salvador authorities have begun compiling a list of freight companies thought to be involved in drug smuggling, though on its own the measure seems unlikely to have much impact on the trade. According to the Salvadoran customs authority (DGA), 152 of the country's freight companies are ""at risk"" of involvement in trafficking based on frequent or repeated drug seizures from their vehicles. Of those, 76 are considered ""high risk"" and the other 76 ""medium risk,"" reported La Prensa Grafica. Several of the companies are linked to ten seizures which turned up a total of 966 kilograms of cocaine and $366,000, according to the newspaper. No arrests or legal proceedings against the companies resulted from those seizures. Raul Alfaro, president of the country's International Freight Carriers Association (ASTIC), admitted many Salvadoran transport companies were involved in drug trafficking. According to a freight driver interviewed by La Prensa Grafica, company owners and managers were often responsible for drugs hidden in vehicles, a claim bolstered by transport union representatives in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, who questioned how companies could charge fees lower than their operational costs to transport legal goods. According to La Prensa Grafica, no Salvadoran transport company has faced prosecution for drug smuggling since 2008. Honduras is the only other country in the region with plans to compile a similar list. While some drivers of trucks concealing drugs have been prosecuted , La Prensa Grafica's piece illustrates how generally there has been near total impunity. Any attempts by El Salvador to remedy that should thus be welcomed. However, such a measure is unlikely to work alone. First, the police corruption and judicial inefficiency that allow drug transporters or even kingpins to walk free after being caught in the act are not going to magically disappear now that authorities have a list of suspects. Second, as is the case with much of the region's counternarcotics efforts, the watchlist targets those lower down the chain of command rather than attacking the criminal organizations who direct the transhipment operations -- although some ""transportistas"" do go on to become major players. Finally, even if the watchlist does lead to more seizures and more prosecutions, it will not stop the flow of drugs north. Traffickers will simply find other forms of transport or new routes if law enforcement on El Salvador's highways creates too much of a headache."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Peru Legislative Decrees Raise Security-Privacy Debate. New legislative decrees in Peru aimed at improving the government's ability to combat organized crime have also stirred debate over the balance between security and the right to privacy. On July 27, the Peruvian government issued a legislative decree allowing police to obtain data on cell phone users from telecommunications companies without a warrant, reported El Peruano. According to the AP , the government said the measure was vital for combating the ill effects of organized crime -- such as drug trafficking, extortion, and hired assassinations -- and will help police identify, locate, and capture criminals. Access to phone data, however, will only be allowed in specific cases: when a crime is in the act of being committed, the person is being investigated for a crime carrying a prison sentence greater than four years, or when it is necessary for police investigations. Police will be required to retroactively seek approval from a judge before using phone data as evidence in court. Phone taps will still require a judicial order. Peru also passed a second legislative decree that formally defines ""murder-for-hire"" in the country's penal code. Those convicted of carrying out contract killings will now receive a minimum prison sentence of 25 years, while those found guilty of using a minor to conduct the crime now face life in prison. The goal of Peru's new legislative decrees is to help the government tackle crime and more effectively provide security. Nonetheless, these laws also raise new concerns. Chief among them is the issue of cell phone surveillance. Indeed, the decree -- which was passed on a national holiday without Congressional debate, using special powers recently granted to President Ollanta Humala -- has evoked criticism from civil liberties defenders. Critics have called the decree an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, mirroring debates in the United States over the bulk collection of user metadata by government agencies. The potential for abuse of these surveillance systems is especially of concern in Latin American countries like Peru, which has weak democratic institutions and rule of law. This increases the possibility that information collected from police surveillance will be diverted towards political ends , and thus negate any postive benefits that this approach may afford the government in its fight against organized crime. Notably, in a previous high-profile case, former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori was convicted of mass illegal surveillance of prominent Peruvian citizens."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Venezuela Arrests Ex-National Guard Officers for Drug Trafficking. The arrests of two retired high-ranking officers in Venezuela's National Guard for drug trafficking may be the result of political maneuverings, rather than an effort to clean up corruption in the country's security forces. As part of a new government security initiative, the Bolivarian National Guard (GNB by its Spanish initials) recently captured Vassyly Kotosky Villarroel Ramirez, alias ""Potro,"" and Robert Alexander Pinto Gil, GNB commander Nestor Reverol said in a press conference. (See video below) Villarroel and Pinto are both former members of the GNB themselves, retiring with the ranks of captain and lieutenant, respectively. Villarroel is believed to have provided security and logistics for Colombian and Mexican organized crime groups shipping drugs to North America. Villarroel's former associates allegedly include Colombian drug traffickers Daniel ""El Loco"" Barrera and Javier Antonio Calle Serna, alias ""Comba,"" a former leader of criminal organization the Rastrojos. He is also believed to have worked with Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, Zetas, and Beltran Leyva Organization. The former GNB captain was sought by local authorities since 2008 and US officials since 2011. The US Treasury Department placed Villarroel on its kingpin list in 2013 and Interpol put out a red alert for his capture in 2014. Former GNB Lieutenant Pinto is accused of organizing drug trafficking activities in central and eastern Venezuela. He was initially captured in 2010 with 336 kilos of cocaine, but later managed to escape authorities. The timing of the recent arrests is curious. Several former and current GNB officers have been accused of drug trafficking , yet Venezuelan authorities have been slow to address issues of corruption within the force. The same is true for the other branches of Venezuela's military, in which corrupt officials involved in cocaine trafficking make up the shadowy criminal network known as the Cartel of the Suns. This high level of impunity for Venezuelan military officials suggests the government's new security initiative may not have been the primary motive behind the arrests of Villarroel and Pinto, as the GNB indicated. Although few definitive conclusions can be drawn so far, it is worth noting that Venezuela is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections in December, and some high-profile captures could be key in helping the ruling party (PSUV) maintain its majority in the national assembly. Indeed, the Venezuelan government has repeatedly shown its willingness to prioritize political issues over improving the country's security situation. The government has even admitted to hiding unflattering crime statistics from the public."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Peru on Course for Record Drug Crop Eradication in 2012. Peru is reportedly set to eradicate a record amount of drug crops this year, though it remains to be seen if this will actually cut the growing area of the country under coca cultivation. In an announcement to the press on October 20, Peruvian Interior Minister Wilfredo Pedraza claimed that the country was on course to eradicate some 14,000 hectares of coca, poppy and marijuana crops this year, reported La Republica. He added that the number will be a record for Peru. Pedraza pointed to the expansion of eradication efforts outside of typical production areas -- such as the Apurimac and Ene River Valley (VRAE) -- to regions such as Cajamarca and La Libertad, as evidence of the state's successes in removing illicit cultivations from its territory. The goal for 2013, Pedraza stated, was to up eradication levels by a further 2,000 hectares to 16,000 hectares. The vast majority of the eradicated crops are likely to be plantations of coca, the country's main illicit crop. Statistics released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) last month on coca leaf cultivation shows 10,290 hectares were eradicated last year. Only 21 hectares of poppy plantations were eradicated in Peru 2010, according to UNODC's 2012 World Drug Report , which states the country is not a major marijuana producer. However, there is little evidence that 2012's eradication efforts will have much effect on the overall level of coca cultivation. UNODC data showed a year-on-year increase in hectares devoted to cultivation since 2006, totalling 62,500 last year. For this reason, it's not clear that even next year's target to eradicate 16,000 hectares will cause real disruption to Peru's drug trade.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Peruvian Police Seize Counterfeit Dollars Bound for Ecuador. Peruvian Police seized nearly $12,000 in fake dollar bills at the border with Ecuador, underscoring Peru's position as the world's leading manufacturer of counterfeit dollars. The seizure was the result of a police intelligence operation which had tracked the money from Lima, reported Correo. The package containing the bills arrived at the border by bus and was to be picked up by a 68-year-old man, who was detained by police. The man claimed he had no knowledge of its contents, and that he was paid approximately $20 by a group of Ecuadoreans to pick up the package and then deliver it to them at a prearranged meeting spot. Officers waited at the meeting point to detain the Ecuadoreans, but they never arrived. Police believe the counterfeit bills belonged to an Ecuadorean mafia group that prints the false bills in southern Peru, reported RPP. InSight Analysis In 2012, Peru surpassed Colombia to become the largest producer of fake bills in the world, responsible for 17 percent of fake bank notes in the United States, according to US authorities. A US-led crackdown on counterfeiting in Colombia is believed to be partly responsible for the increase in Peru, which lacks strong anti-fraud forces and anti-counterfeiting laws. Counterfeiting groups in Peru mostly rely on sophisticated operations that use offset printers, a traditional printing technique, to produce large batches of high quality fake banknotes, reported Time. Most of the operations uncovered by police are in Lima. Criminal groups in Peru also specialize in fake euro notes, as well as Venezuelan bolivares fuertes and Chilean and Bolivian pesos, which gives them the freedom to switch currencies if one currency is the target of anti-counterfeiting measures. In July 2012, members of the Quispe Rodriguez crime clan were arrested with $2 million in counterfeit dollars and 1.5 million in fake euros, reported the Peruvian Times. This latest seizure would seem to suggest Peruvian counterfeit dollars are not only destined for the United States but also for the considerably closer market in Ecuador, where the US dollar is the official currency. 	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Caribbean to US Cocaine Trafficking Doubles in a Year: US. Drug trafficking through the Caribbean doubled in the first half of 2013 compared to the previous year, according to the DEA, as traffickers return to the region to escape the increased law enforcement pressure on Central America routes. According to the Drugs Enforcement Administration (DEA), the first half of this year saw 14 percent of cocaine destined for the United States trafficked through the Caribbean, compared to seven percent in the same period of 2012. The DEA's Caribbean division head, Vito S. Guarino, said the trend is likely to continue over the coming years, reported the Miami Herald. According to the DEA, Puerto Rico in particular is becoming increasingly important to traffickers because of the lack of customs inspections on the journey to the United States. This was underlined earlier this month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) dismantled a major drug trafficking organization based on the island, which it labeled the ""most powerful organization"" in Caribbean trafficking over the last 20 years. These latest figures from the DEA reiterate a message which has been coming from US officials since last year. In April this year, State Department official William Brownfield declared that a revival of Caribbean trafficking routes was on the cards as drug traffickers look to avoid the ramped up law enforcement efforts in Central America. The United States has been channeling funds and assistance to anti-narcotics efforts in the region for several years and recent initiatives such as the $200 million provided through the 2010 Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) have boosted long term operations such as the drug interdiction efforts of the Operation Bahamas, Turks and Caicos ( OPBAT ). Some of these operations have registered notable successes. Improved facilities for tracking air traffic, such as the new radar system introduced in Puerto Rico in January, have been particularly effective in reducing drug flights into the region. However, sea routes remain a serious problem. T he combination of inadequate state resources and expansive coast lines make the go-fast boats and submarines traffickers use to transport their product between Caribbean islands extremely difficult to monitor."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Honduras Extradites Ex-Cop With Alleged Drug Ties to US. A former police intelligence agent became the eighth criminal suspect that Honduras has extradited to the United States to face drug trafficking charges in just over a year. Wilmer Carranza Bonilla was arrested in June 2015 , accused of working with the Valle Valle drug trafficking organization. On October 15, he was handed over to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents and put on a plane to the US, where a federal court in Virginia had indicted him for involvement in money laundering and drug trafficking. That same court had previously indicted Miguel Arnulfo and Luis Alonso Valle Valle, the two brothers who lead the drug trafficking clan. Honduras passed a law in 2012 that permitted the extradition of suspects charged with drug trafficking and terrorism, but the first alleged drug trafficker was not sent to face trial in the US until May 2014. Since then, however, Honduras has captured and extradited several high-profile drug traffickers, including the leaders of the Valle Valle clan. It is fairly unusual for a Latin American nation to extradite a security official to the US to face charges there. Colombia has occasionally done so , but there are few comparable cases from other countries struggling with a vibrant transnational drug trade, such as Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Carranza's extradition comes as another example of how successfully the US has managed to prod Honduras into taking action against powerful narco-clans. The Valle Valles were a prominent drug trafficking organization known for their penchant for paying off officials. Notably, when the youngest brother of the Valle Valle clan was arrested in October 2014, police said they had found a photo of him alongside the head of the Transit Police in Copan, the state where the group based its operations. Thus, Carranza Bonilla is unlikely to have been the only friend to the Valle Valles in the security forces. Nor was Carranza Bonilla a very high-ranking official within the police, although he did work in a unit that investigated drug trafficking crimes. Given the Valle Valles' wealth and extent of influence, it is worth questioning whether there were more powerful figures within the police, military, and political realm that they had manged to corrupt, and whether Honduras will continue to investigate who else the Valle Valle allies may include.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"US Pushes Honduras to Crack Down on Cachiros. The Honduras government, working closely with US authorities, has cracked down on one of Honduras' largest drug transport organizations, the Cachiros, seizing properties and businesses and in the process painting a picture of a group whose reach may extend to Honduras' political and possibly its financial elite. Honduras police and military have identified 61 properties, 4 commercial establishments, and 24 vehicles in two provinces for seizure, as well as 64 dollar and lempira bank accounts to be frozen at the US Treasury Department's behest, La Prensa reported. The US Treasury estimated the value of the assets at $500 million, the newspaper said. In a statement , the Treasury said the Cachiros is headed by Javier and Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, and its members include their father, Santos Isidro Rivera Cardona, mother, Esperanza Caridad Maradiaga Lopez, sister, Maira Lizeth Rivera Maradiaga, and brother, Santos Isidro Rivera Maradiaga. They do not face charges in Honduras and no formal indictment has been released in the United States. As opposed to its July 1 statement , in which it named the group as ""specially designated narcotics traffickers"" without providing details, the Treasury this time identified several companies the group controls, among them a mining operation, a cattle ranch, an African Palm oil processor and a zoo. An anonymous Treasury source told El Heraldo that there were ""dozens"" of companies and proxies laundering money for the organization. The money comes from the group's lucrative drug trafficking business, which the Treasury detailed in its statement. ""Los Cachiros coordinates the movement of drugs to and from Honduras for Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations, including the Sinaloa Cartel,"" the Treasury said. ""Los Cachiros employs land, air, and sea conveyances in its movement of drugs, and its activities have been linked to seizures of cocaine in Central America. It is reported that Los Cachiros controls 90 percent of the clandestine airstrips in Honduras, and it uses these airstrips to facilitate the entry of drugs into Honduras and Guatemala."" If you look at the organizational chart provided by the Treasury (see below, or for complete version see attachment), you might mistake this group for a small, rural band of gangsters. But this organization has deep contacts in the country's elite that keep their money safe and the judicial authorities at bay. It also has a distribution network that stretches into three countries. At least part of their reach came to light in a cable released by Wikileaks in which outgoing Ambassador Charles Ford spoke candidly about then President Manuel Zelaya. In the cable, Ford talks of ways in which criminal groups ""have pressured [Zelaya] to name one of their own"" to a high level post in the Security Ministry. One of those groups was presumably the Cachiros, who, when their candidate was not selected, took it personally. Senator Juan Ramon Salgado Cuevas was assassinated shortly thereafter, and Honduran intelligence told InSight Crime it was because Salgado had failed to secure the Cachiros' candidate for the ministry job. The Treasury also does not mention the family's possible link to the Tocoa soccer club, Real Sociedad Municipal, whose players wear on their chests the logo of Joya Grande, the zoo in question, and whose ownership has been tied to the Cachiros. The club counts Banco Continental -- a company managed by one of the country's wealthiest families -- as one of its other sponsors. The support has worked. The club has moved to the first division where it is considered one of the best teams. The Treasury does make reference to the distribution chain, noting that Nicaraguan authorities arrested Nicaraguan national and alleged Cachiros associate Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron last August. He remains in custody in Nicaragua, facing charges of drug trafficking with the Cachiros to the north and the Norte del Valle Cartel in Colombia to the south. However, the Cachiros main contacts are along the Guatemala - Honduras border where they can pass cocaine to their Guatemalan and Mexican counterparts, collecting about $2,000 per kilo. If it is true that they control 90 percent of the air traffic coming through Honduras, then that would make some healthy profits. By InSight Crime's estimates, the family grosses up to $4 million per month from its trafficking operations, which are concentrated in the Colon province. The Cachiros are the second large organization from Honduras that the US Treasury has outed in recent months. The other is led by Jose Miguel ""Chepe"" Handal Perez, a politician and businessman operating from San Pedro Sula, who is at large after the US added him to the same list the Cachiros made in July. As they did with Handal, Honduran authorities have declared that battle is being waged. The head of the Senate's banking committee called on banks to stop doing business with money launderers ; a frontrunner in November's presidential elections said all candidates should ""abstain from using dirty money."" But sincerity is in short supply in Honduras. Santos Isidro Rivera was arrested briefly earlier this year on weapons charges but released. Leonel was arrested in 2011 , but also released. The Honduran state has largely collapsed, leaving a rich stew of corruption and drug trafficking, which is now boiling over. Witness the fact that the Cachiros have a road construction business, the perfect way to feed corrupt politicians and launder illicit proceeds at the same time. Drug traffickers still appear to fear the United States, especially the prospect of extradition, which the Honduras government recently green-lighted. However, only one person, who was not a Honduran, has been extradited since, and while the United States is pressuring the Honduran government to start capturing and extraditing local suspects, the subject appears to be too sensitive , especially with presidential elections coming. To be sure, the United States, despite providing millions in support for the security and judicial authorities in Honduras, seems to have run out of ways to pressure the Honduran state to reform its own institutions and to take action on its own. And while efforts such as the move to tackle the Cachiros are an important first step, they came at the behest of a powerful outsider, not a reform-minded, courageous Honduran seeking to change the direction of this nation.

"After Guatemala Presidents Fall, Reconfiguration or Status Quo for Military Criminal Networks?Guatemala's President Otto Perez Molina's late-night resignation could upend deeply entrenched military criminal networks or -- as has been Guatemalan tradition -- leave them exactly how they are. Perez Molina handed his resignation letter to Congress just hours after the legislative body voted to take away his immunity and a judge ordered authorities to arrest him for his involvement in a massive customs scheme to falsify documents, bilk importers and siphon state resources. Former Constitutional Court Judge turned Vice President Alejandro Maldonado is now president. Former President -- and ex military general -- Perez Molina was a perfect example of a bureaucratic elite in Guatemala -- someone who had built his economic and political power using his positions in the state, mostly through his connections to the military. The president was also long part of what was known as the Sindicato, a shadowy network of former and current military personnel that was equal parts criminal facilitator and criminal actor. The network facilitated schemes like ""La Linea,"" the name given to the customs fraud network that allegedly included the former Vice President Roxana Baldetti, who is in jail already. The president and the vice president were referred to on the wiretaps as ""number one"" and ""number two,"" among other names. The president had to face questions in court about this and other accusations shortly after he resigned. For a long time, the Sindicato competed with what was known as the Cofradia, another shadowy network of current and former military personnel that was both criminal actor and criminal facilitator. These networks were referred to as Illegal Clandestine Security Apparatuses (Cuerpos Ilegales y Aparatos Clandestinos de Seguridad - CIACS), and they were the reason why the United Nation's backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) was formed in 2007 ( the mandate makes direct reference to the CIACS). To some extent, the CICIG has fulfilled its mandate of going after the CIACS. CICIG targeted networks such as the one connected to former President Alfonso Portillo , and other CIACS-related cases have led to the incarceration of members of these networks. Perez Molina's resignation is certainly the finest testament yet that these networks have at least been partially dismantled. And over time, the power of networks like the Cofradia and the Sindicato has dissipated. Guatemala is currently in more of a post-CIACS world. To be sure, Perez Molina's presidency was thought to be a fusion of the two networks in which members of the Cofradia and the Sindicato worked together. Witness the case of Francisco Javier Ortiz, alias ""Teniente Jerez,"" who was arrested as part of La Linea scandal. Ortiz participated in a customs fraud scandal in the 1990s that was exactly like La Linea, except under the management of the Cofradia. The head of the Cofradia was retired General Francisco Ortega Menaldo, and, to a certain extent, Ortega Menaldo represents what remains to be done in Guatemala. Ortega Menaldo is a ghost of sorts. He stopped officially working with governments after trying to engineer an ""auto-coup"" in 1993, but he has remained a significant political and underworld actor. The former general was unofficially connected, but not indicted, to the Portillo corruption scheme in the early 2000s. And as recently as 2012, he was believed to be controlling Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala's largest port where he had his own mini-La Linea scheme set up. Ortega Menaldo has also been the target of numerous investigations by the Guatemalan Attorney General's Office and perhaps even the United States. His visa was revoked, at least for a time, by the US for suspected ties to drug traffickers. Still, Ortega Menaldo has never been charged with a crime. And while it may be anachronistic to talk about the Cofradia, it is still relevant to talk about criminal networks who are ex military and have active roles in the government or could have active roles in the near future. One of the leading candidates for president -- Jimmy Morales -- fits into this mold. More precisely, his political party -- Frente de Convergencia Nacional (FCN) -- was founded and is made up of ex-military personnel from the Asociacion de Veteranos Militares de Guatemala, AVEMILGUA , the public face of some of the dangerous military personnel that started this mess in the first place. While Morales has presented himself as an anti-corruption candidate, the one-time comedian represents the interests of AVEMILGUA. The latest poll for the first round of September 6 elections has Morales on top. None of the candidates are expected to win enough votes to avoid a run-off between the top two vote-getters, which is scheduled for October 25. What's more, Perez Molina has not yet been convicted, and the record for prosecutions in Guatemala against ex-presidents is not good. Alfonso Portillo was eventually acquitted in a Guatemalan court for a technicality. And after a historic victory in the case against former military dictator Efrain Rios Montt for genocide, that decision was reversed by the Constitutional Court just a few days later. One of the judges who ruled in favor of Rios Montt is now President Alejandro Maldonado."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"$350 Billion Lost to Corruption in Venezuela: Expert. An independent specialist says government officials in Venezuela have diverted some $350 billion from state coffers, which if true reveals the extent to which corruption plagues the country. Oscar Solorzano, a Peruvian lawyer at the International Center for Asset Recovery of the Basel Institute on Governance , said the $350 billion figure puts Venezuela atop the list of countries that have lost the most amount of money due to corruption, reported El Nacional. The country with the second-highest total, which Solorzano did not identify, has lost $100 billion to corruption, according to El Nacional. Freddy Guevara, a National Assembly representative and president of the Comptroller General Office's permanent committee in the Assembly, announced that he will submit a proposal aimed at recovering the state money that has been diverted into the coffers of corrupt politicians. ""We are in the presence of the most corrupt regime in the Western Hemisphere,"" said Guevara, who is also the national coordinator for the opposition party Voluntad Popular. ""How does one explain that in a country with a fixed exchange rate, many officials have [bank] accounts in Andorra worth approximately $4 billion, enough to pay off the debt owed from the food sector, which is close to $1.6 billion? The answer is easy: corruption."" Guevara added that corruption at Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA has cost the government $10 billion. Although it is unclear how Solorzano came up with the $350 billion figure, Venezuela has for years been considered one of the most corrupt countries in Latin America, and even the world. In Transparency International's 2015 Corruption Perceptions Index , Venezuela ranked 158th of 167 countries worldwide, and was tied with Haiti as the most corrupt in the Americas. One of the main sources of corruption in Venezuela is the country's fixed exchange rates, which thanks to runaway inflation have created a huge gulf between the official currency exchange rates and the black market rate. The limited number of US dollars in Venezuela means importers often have to pay off officials at the country's currency control agency, known as CADIVI, for the right to trade local currency at the government's extremely low exchange rates. One Venezuelan businessman told the New York Times last year that importers pay bribes of up to several hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to receive permission to ship in a product from abroad. The importers -- who frequently wildly inflate the value of their imported products in order to get access to a greater amount of US currency -- are then free to either pocket the prized US dollars or trade them on the black market at an enormous mark-up. In addition to import schemes, high-level politicians and military officials are suspected of being deeply involved in Venezuela's lucrative cocaine trade."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"The Necessary Evils of Drug Investigations on Mexico Border. Reports of FBI agents allowing drugs to be smuggled over the Mexican border, and working for years with a top Sinaloa Cartel operative, hint at the fundamental ambiguities of the drug war, and the challenges that the authorities face when trying to sort fact from fiction. On Monday, the El Paso Times reported on how two ex-FBI informants provided the newspaper with a long and detailed account of how U.S. law enforcement allegedly turned a blind eye to drug trafficking along the Mexican border. The two men, retired sheriff's deputy Greg Gonzalez and former livestock investigator Wesley Dutton, allege that the FBI failed to act on the intelligence they provided. This reportedly included information about corrupt U.S. officials who helped traffickers move drugs across the border, and fed them information about the movements of Border Patrol agents. The ""whistle-blowers"" say they even have intelligence about U.S. politicians who have received large donations from ""the drug cartels."" At first glance, the story has some obvious parallels to the ""Fast and the Furious"" scandal. At one point, Dutton states that the FBI encouraged him to accept drug shipments from Mexico, smuggled over the border in horse saddles, as part of its investigations. Dutton's allegation implies that U.S. officials knowingly allowed drugs to enter from Mexico, just like they allowed gun traffickers to move assault weapons south. For those looking to make a comparison to the ATF's ""Fast and the Furious"" Operation, it would be all too easy to cry ""foul."" That being said, the credibility of the claims made in the El Paso piece are undermined by the sources' obvious political agenda. Dutton makes it clear he has a serious axe to grind with the FBI, stating the agency owes him ""thousands of dollars"" in funds he used to pay the cartels in the allegedly FBI-sanctioned drug deals. Nor is their case helped by the fact they are now working with Judicial Watch , a conservative non-profit that promotes ""transparency and accountability"" in politics. Last year, the organization named Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Jesse Jackson as among the 10 most corrupt politicians in the country. Much of the intelligence cited by Dutton and Gonzalez does not appear to be actionable or provable, just more rumors in the swirl of half-truths found along the border. In some ways, their account is interesting for the same reasons why one court case currently unfolding in Chicago has drawn so much attention. The trial involves one of Mexico's most notorious drug lords, Jesus Zambada Niebla, alias ""Vicentillo,"" son of a top leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. In a motion filed last July, his defense team argued that during a five-year period, he trafficked drugs with the permission of U.S. law enforcement in exchange for information about his rivals, the Juarez Cartel. While it is also worth questioning the credibility of these claims, they hint at a deeper truth in the U.S.'s handling of the Mexican drug panorama. The border zone is filled with double agents, and often U.S. officials have to take part in morally ambiguous operations. This includes relying on informants who may continue to traffic drugs and kill people, but will still expect protection in return for their information. Vicentillo's trial is an unusual case involving a high-level drug trafficker alleging that the U.S. government promised him immunity in exchange for intelligence on rival cartels. The outcome of the case is worth tracking, but, in some ways, Vicentillo is not the one on trial. Rather, what is at stake is some of the basic assumptions regarding how U.S. law enforcement should tackle the ""drug war."" Should the FBI allow cocaine to be smuggled across the border in horse saddles, if that helps the U.S. better understand the routes and tactics favored by drug gangs? Should the ATF have allowed gun traffickers to sell arms to Mexican cartels, weapons later responsible for the death of both Mexican and U.S. citizens, if this allowed them to better trace the overall patterns of the arms trade? The cases of Vicentillo, Gonzalez and Dutton -- whether or not their claims prove true -- are an implicit reminder of the moral ambiguity often encountered in anti-narcotics work. The uncomfortable truth is that when government agencies carry out significant investigations, this may entail allowing controlled deliveries of guns and drugs across the border. It may also entail cutting deals with informants who have a great deal of blood of their hands. In no occasion does covert law enforcement work justify extrajudicial killings or other human rights abuses. But it bears pointing out that there are necessary evils when it comes to covert operations in the drug world. And two of these necessary evils are the orchestrated shipment of guns and drugs, as well as the reliance on witnesses who remain involved in criminal activity. Especially considering the political witchhunt that has followed the ""Fast and the Furious"" affair, it's worth remembering that, especially if Congress ties the hands of law enforcement agencies, it's no good to raise an outcry when those same agencies resort to morally ambiguous acts.

"Is the Godfather of Mexicos Drug Trade Back in Business?The founder of Mexico's notorious and now defunct Guadalajara Cartel, Rafael Caro Quintero, has been linked to two recent events that have raised alarm among authorities three years after a controversial court ruling freed the veteran drug lord and current fugitive from prison. Caro Quintero, now in his mid-60s, has been dubbed the ""narco of narcos"" and the godfather of Mexico drug trafficking. After establishing himself as one of the country's most powerful drug lords in the 1980s, he was imprisoned in 1989 for drug trafficking, murder, and perhaps most importantly, for the abduction, torture and killing of Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena, an agent for the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Now, authorities suspect that the legendary crime boss could be attempting a comeback, after reports hinted at his involvement in a pair of recent confrontations involving the infamous Sinaloa Cartel and its jailed leader, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman -- a one-time underworld associate of Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero started his career in the drug business in the 1970s running a mega-marijuana farm in northern Mexico to supply the US market. He later progressed to the more lucrative business of trafficking Pablo Escobar's Colombian cocaine into the United States. Shortly after the brutal murder of the DEA agent Camarena in 1985, Caro Quintero was detained in Costa Rica and transferred to Mexico. After nearly three decades behind bars, he was released on a technicality in 2013 and soon went underground. Almost as soon as Caro Quintero was released, The US State Department offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest. The DEA also put him on their most wanted fugitives list, and Mexican authorities issued a new warrant for his arrest, saying he should serve out the remainder of his original 40-year sentence. Since his 2013 release from prison, Caro Quintero seemed to be laying low. However, his name has surfaced in connection with an attack in mid-June on ""El Chapo"" Guzman's hometown in Sinaloa state. Guzman was reputed to be Mexico's most powerful contemporary drug lord before his three recent arrests and two escapes, but the Sinaloa Cartel kingpin's luck seems to have taken a turn for the worse after his latest capture. He is now fighting extradition to the United States. While the circumstances of that spate of violence in the mountains of Sinaloa remain unclear, most versions indicate the gunmen were working for the rival Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO), and some accounts have linked Caro Quintero to the events. Farther to the north, in the neighboring state of Chihuahua, some official sources have said Caro Quintero has been trying to move in on territory controlled by Guzman's Sinaloa Cartel. Beginning in 2008, the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels waged a bloody turf war centered on the strategic border outpost of Ciudad Juarez. After several years of bloodshed, Guzman's organization came out on top. More recently, Caro Quintero himself resurfaced in a secretly recorded interview with Mexico's Proceso news magazine published on July 25. He denied having problems with anyone except the authorities, whom he offered an apology. He said he had nothing to do with Camarena's 1985 murder, but was in the wrong place at the wrong time. ""I am not at war with anyone. El Chapo and El Mayo are my friends,"" he told Proceso, referring to Guzman and another top Sinaloa Cartel boss, Ismael Zambada Garcia, who remains at large. Caro Quintero said he was trying to get out of trouble, not into it. If the official reports about Caro Quintero's return to active participation in Mexico's organized crime arena are accurate, any assessment of the notorious capo and his network's role in the country's current criminal dynamics should start with an understanding of their history. The Logic of Cartel Violence A good place to start is an examination of the interaction between the logic of the clan and the logic of the criminal organization. Logic of the clan takes things personally. It tends to lead to revenge killings and collective punishment. For example, the violent attack in June that dislodged El Chapo's mother from her home in the mountains of Sinaloa was reportedly motivated by the murder of a member of the Beltran Leyva family, a killing allegedly ordered by El Chapo's brother, Aurelino Guzman. The weekly Rio Doce magazine has reported that ""El Chapo"" opposed his brother's actions. These reported protestations apparently were not enough to forestall what the news site Estado Mayor characterized as the ""reactivation of the bloody conflict between the Beltran Leyva and Guzman Loera clans."" On the other hand, the logic of organized crime revolves around territorial control. Disputes over trafficking routes and ""plazas,"" as key centers of illegal activity are known, involve selective attacks targeting important individuals such as crime bosses, hit men, and even small-scale traffickers working for a rival. The historic battle between the once-allied Sinaloa and Beltran Leyva cartels is an example of this logic. In fact, the recent violence in Sinaloa has a precedent in conflict between the two groups that caused the displacement of thousands of Sinaloa residents in 2013. These two forms of criminal logic -- of the clan and of the organization -- are not mutually exclusive. Rather, they constantly interact in an ebb and flow, at times reinforcing one another. The question now is how Caro Quintero might be inserting himself and his networks into this logic of criminal violence. The veteran drug trafficker's roots in Badiraguato, Sinaloa -- the site of recent violence that displaced several hundred people -- provide personal connections and an opportunity to form or renew alliances in the area. However, it is the logic of the organization that poses the biggest threat to security and poses the most relevant questions. Where is Caro Quintero? Looking further south to Guadalajara, in Jalisco state, the US Treasury Department has linked Caro Quintero to luxury properties and the financial network of Ismael Esparragoza ""El Azul ,"" who reportedly worked with both the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels and promoted an alliance between them. In May 2016, the US Treasury Department designated Caro Quintero's common-law wife a narcotics trafficker and accused her of managing assets on his behalf. The couple met in a Jalisco prison around 2008 and allegedly have luxury real estate holdings in the state capital, Guadalajara. Despite Caro Quintero's ties to Jalisco, the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG) has in recent years taken over some of his old areas of operation there, according to the news outlet Milenio. Assuming Caro Quintero is still active and has focused his attention further north, it is unclear if he was displaced from Jalisco by competition or has moved voluntarily in search of greater opportunity. The aging fugitive may be avoiding Jalisco because law enforcement is generating too much heat there. Authorities have mounted a heavily militarized hunt in Jalisco for CJNG leader Nemesio Oseguera, alias ""El Mencho."" The state is also home to the penitentiary where Caro Quintero last served time. Exploring opportunities further north in places where he has contacts and that are less heavily patrolled by Mexican authorities might be a logical choice. Sonora is another possible base of operations , security sources recently told the newspaper La Jornada. Sonora is a large state north of Sinaloa that accounts for most of Mexico's border with the US state of Arizona. In the south, Sonora also borders Mexico's Golden Triangle , a strategic region for both opium poppy cultivation and drug trafficking. La Jornada's sources claimed Caro Quintero has enlisted the support of former Beltran Leyva hit men who created their own groups, Los Pelones and Los Gueros. In February 2015, a close associate reportedly married to one of Caro Quintero's family members was arrested in Sonora and accused of managing cross-border drug traffic. Who is Caro Quintero Working With? The security sources cited by La Jornada speculated that Caro Quintero had strengthened his position in Sonora following the February 2016 arrest of Francisco Javier Hernandez Garcia , alias ""El 2000."" Authorities identified the captured trafficker as a member of the Hernandez clan, allies of the Beltran Leyva cartel, and a controller of drug routes through the state. Whether or not Caro Quintero had anything to do with the violence in and around El Chapo's home town in June -- and which side he might have been aligned with in that conflict -- is unclear at best. Reporte Indigo recently cited federal government intelligence sources who said Caro Quintero continued to operate during his long years in prison with the help of ""El Chapo,"" and has assumed control of much of the Sinaloa Cartel's operation since Guzman went back to prison in January 2016. Sorting out fact from fiction is rarely easy when it comes to matters of organized crime. But if the central government's intelligence is true to its name, it does appear that Caro Quintero, despite 28 years behind bars, has maintained a variety of contacts and networks in the drug trafficking world. In a criminal landscape that is characterized by a multitude of actors and continuous shifting of alliances, the ""narco of narcos"" appears to be in an advantageous position. *Jesus Perez Caballero is an independent researcher of issues related to organized crime, drug trafficking and penal law in Latin America.

"Growth of Extortion a Major Concern for Peru: Official. A top police official has highlighted the growing problem of extortion in Peru, amid reports that $10 billion is laundered in the country each year, in a sign local criminals could be adopting methods popular elsewhere in the region. General Cesar Cortijo, the director of Peru's Criminal Investigation Office (DIRINCRI), told InSight Crime that ""the growing problem facing the Peruvian police is an increase in extortion. This is particularly relevant in the construction sector, but is now becoming more generalized."" The growth of the problem is evident in the transport sector. According to Chiclayo prosecutor Juan Carrasco Millones, 14,000 taxi drivers in the northern coastal city pay fees to the manager of their company, which are then remitted to local gangs, reported Peru 21. Carrasco said Chiclayo gangs have collected over $900,000 in extortion fees since 2012, paid directly by the victims into some 150 bank accounts, which each receive between $18,000 and $45,000 before being closed. Extortion is one important contributor to the country's growing money laundering problem, which the country's Attorney General Jose Antonio Pelaez Bardales says is now worth $10 billion a year, reported La Republica , a major increase from the slightly over $5 billion reported in 2011. Earlier this year, the managers of 33 transport companies in the Lambayeque province, where Chiclayo is located, came under fire for collaborating with criminal groups running extortion rackets by charging fees to their employees. Similar forms of micro-extortion are also common in Colombia , and the fact that at least one Colombian gang has been found operating in Peru makes it possible Peruvian gangs are learning their methods from Colombian groups. Money laundering profits in Peru are estimated to account for up to 3.5 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Along with extortion, major illicit industries in the country include illegal gold mining, estimated by the country's top anti-drugs lawyer to be worth $3 billion a year, drug trafficking, worth around $1.2 billion, illegal timber extraction, worth up to $500 million, and domestic human trafficking. Casinos and budget hotels are two major enterprises used to launder illicit funds: in June, Lima authorities reported a large increase in the number of such businesses in the capital. The crime is also facilitated by the impunity which its perpetrators enjoy -- despite attempts by Peruvian authorities to increase controls -- and by widespread corruption, with numerous politicians investigated for money laundering and drug trafficking ties."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Zetas Used Horse-Breeding Company to Launder Money in US. In a worrisome display of a drug cartel's ability to hide illicit funds in the United States, Mexico's Zetas laundered millions of dollars in drug profits through a high-profile horse breeding business across the border. According to a New York Times investigation , the drug gang began using a horse breeding program in the US as a front company for drug trafficking in 2009. Jose Trevino Morales, an older brother of Zeta lieutenant Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, alias "" Z-40 ,"" allegedly used drug profits to buy and breed horses for the quarter horse racing circuit. The federal indictment in the case claims that businessmen in Mexico would purchase horses using their own bank accounts, and were later compensated under the table with drug money. Ownership of the horses was then transferred to Jose Trevino's company. The Times claims its staff first learned of the scheme in December 2011 while investigating the Zetas, but agreed to refrain from reporting on it until after US law enforcement agents raided Trevino's ranch on June 12, arresting him and six others. The case provides a worrisome reminder that Mexican drug cartels' operations do not simply end at the US border. In addition to overseeing major smuggling routes , drug trafficking organizations routinely launder their profits in US border states. Of these, law enforcement officials have identified Arizona as the primary ""consolidation point"" for drug proceeds. More amazing than the fact that the Zetas ran such an extensive operation across the border, however, is the blatant manner in which it did so. In a surprising move for an associate of a criminal organization known for its cold efficiency, Jose Trevino worked to become a successful and well-known figure in the world of horse trading and breeding. His horses won three of the industry's biggest races over the past three years. Trevino made no effort to hide his wealth and had no qualms about speaking with reporters. One horse was even named ""Number One Cartel."" "	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Why Is Choco A Haven for Colombias Criminal Groups?The kidnapping of a military general by FARC rebels operating in Colombia's Pacific state of Choco -- which led to the suspension of peace talks with the government -- has shone a spotlight on the organized crime dynamics present in the country's most valuable criminal real estate. Following the November 16 abduction of General Ruben Alzate by the 34th Front of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), just miles from Choco's capital Quibdo, President Juan Manuel Santos suspended peace talks with the guerrilla group for the first time since negotiations began two years ago. While the general's release appears imminent -- particularly now that the FARC has released two soldiers captured in a different region earlier this month -- the event has still turned all eyes on Colombia's poorest province, which has long served as a hub for criminal activity. Meanwhile, a November 22 armed strike called in Choco by the country's other main rebel group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), which forced the suspension of bus operations between Quibdo and Medellin, served as an indication of the level of control enjoyed by illegal groups in the northwest Pacific coastal province. For years, Choco was a battleground for left-wing rebel groups and right-wing paramilitaries fighting for control of important drug trafficking routes and access to gold mines. Many civilians, often poor Afro-Colombian or indigenous populations, were caught in the crossfire of this power struggle. In one notorious example, the 2002 FARC bombing of a church in the town of Bojaya left over 100 dead and reportedly displaced nearly 6,000 more. Today, Choco is home to all of Colombia's most prominent armed groups. The FARC control the most territory and have the greatest number of boots on the ground, with the 34th Front, the 57th Front and the Aurelio Rodriguez Front all present in the region. The ELN and two of the country's officially recognized BACRIM (from the Spanish for ""criminal bands""), the Urabenos and Rastrojos, also have a presence in the coastal province. The neo-paramilitary group Renacer also operated in Choco, but has now largely been absorbed by the Urabenos. Although drug trafficking and illegal gold mining remain the primary sources of revenue for organized crime groups in Choco, the criminal dynamics have changed from previous decades. While the FARC and paramilitaries frequently clashed over control of coca crops, today's BACRIM would rather buy coca from the rebel army than fight them for it. There have been no signs of drug deals between the FARC's 34th Front and BACRIM in Choco, but the absence of conflict between them indicates they have made agreements to divide the territory. There have also been police reports of the 34th Front aligning with the BACRIM to illegally extract gold in the province. One of Choco's attractions to criminal groups is its access to maritime drug routes. Choco's coastline serves as a strategic refueling point for go-fast boats shipping cocaine north towards Central America and Mexico, and the FARC's 57th Front reportedly controls the coastal area bordering Panama (see map below). Choco also offers access to the Gulf of Uraba, which is largely controlled by the Urabenos, who use it as a jumping-off point for semi-submersible vessels loaded with drugs that travel up the Caribbean Coast. This gulf will likely continue to grow in importance to drug traffickers, amid a resurgence in the popularity of Caribbean sea routes. Choco is also valuable territory because of its natural resources. One of these is coca, which is primarily cultivated in central Choco. The highest density of crops is concentrated along the San Juan River in the southern half of the province, according to the June 2014 UNODC coca cultivation survey. While it is not entirely clear what criminal organizations control coca production in Choco, territory controlled by the FARC's 57th Front and Aurelio Rodriguez Front, as well as the ELN, overlaps with some areas of coca cultivation. Even more profitable for criminal groups than coca are Choco's gold mines, principally located in the province's jungle areas. Along with neighboring Antioquia, Choco is the largest producer of illegal gold in Colombia. While other criminal groups like the ELN are also profiting from illegal gold mining in Choco, reports indicate the FARC are the most directly involved in the operations, overseeing the purchase of bulldozers and other heavy machinery. This rebel group is thought to take in as much as 20 percent of the profits originating from this criminal activity in Colombia. Another characteristic of Choco which may attract criminal groups is its extreme inaccessibility: just one highway passes through Quibdo and large sections of the interior lack road access. This seclusion offers criminal groups a welcome respite from offensives by Colombian security forces. According to Quibdo Bishop Juan Carlos Barreto, the Colombian government has largely abandoned Choco; he recently indicated to El Pais that the FARC has a stronger presence there than the state. Indeed, most observers were not as surprised by the kidnapping of a general in Choco -- the highest ranking military official taken by the FARC in the country's 50 year conflict -- as by the fact Alzate would enter the rebel-held territory wearing civilian clothing and without a security detail."	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Report: 50,000 Abducted Children in Mexico. A Mexican NGO estimates that there are around 50,000 child abductees in Mexico today. According to Guillermo Gutierrez Romero, the president of Mexico's Association of Missing and Stolen Children, the majority of them are sexually exploited. An article in Sinaloa's El Noroeste reports that Gutierrez's organization has released new data illustrating the dark reality of child trafficking in the country. ""We do not have the exact number of total cases,"" said Gutierrez, ""and we do not use the national registry to know how many children are stolen in Mexico. Quite frequently the states omit certain information as it suits their interests."" Still, according to estimates based on the numbers of cases his organization receives, Gutierrez said Mexico is considered the ""Bangkok of Latin America,"" attracting pedophiles from all around the world. According to Gutierrez, this practice is most common in the country's most popular tourist destinations, including port cities like Veracruz and Cancun. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Liberty Reserve Case Exposes New Frontiers in Laundering Digital Cash. The takedown of a global currency exchange that prosecutors say was the largest online money laundering operation in history has exposed digital currency as a surprisingly effective method of washing money, including drug trafficking profits. More than $6 billion was laundered through Liberty Reserve, a Costa Rica-based company that allowed its more than one million customers, of which 200,000 were U.S. citizens, to open accounts and move money anonymously using its virtual currency. From 2006 through 2013, Liberty Reserve was the ""bank of choice for the criminal underworld,"" serving computer hackers, identity thieves, child pornographers and drug traffickers, according to a US federal indictment unsealed last week. Although the indictment did not state who, exactly, was using Liberty Reserve to launder money, Tom Kellermann, a vice president at security company Trend Micro, said that recent investigations have shown that international drug cartels have ""migrated"" online to launder money. ""This is just the tip of the iceberg,"" Kellermann told InSight Crime by e-mail. The shutdown of Liberty Reserve's website, along with new federal rules that aim to make digital currencies comply with money laundering laws, has made it clear that US law enforcement has digital currencies within its sights. But policing them is hardly simple: Liberty Reserve is just one of many online currency exchange systems that require little more than an e-mail address to sign up. Panama-based Perfect Money and Russia-based WebMoney are two more, although both no longer take dollars from US customers in an apparent attempt to not run afoul of the new laws. And exchangers of Bitcoin, a crypto-currency used in some forms of e-commerce, have also found themselves under increasing government scrutiny. ""You will see after a couple of weeks that the system will be rebooted,"" said Aditya Sood, a senior consultant for computer security firm IOActive who has published extensively on cyber crime. Criminals, he said, ""will shift to other systems because this is such a huge market, and there will be a rise in other e-currencies."" Liberty Reserve was, in effect, a bank that issued its own digital currency. The key to Liberty's system was that it never actually received deposits, but instead used a series of middlemen, or money exchangers, who bought the currency in bulk and then sold smaller portions to people looking to convert money into the digital currency. It worked like this: customers opened an account with Liberty Reserve, using an e-mail address, along with a name and physical address, both of which could be fake. They then transferred money to one of the money exchangers, who deposited an equivalent amount of Liberty Reserve currency in the account for a five percent transaction fee. The illegal money exchangers tended to be in countries with little government oversight, such as Malaysia, Russia, Nigeria, and Vietnam, according to the indictment. Once the money was in the Liberty Reserve currency, it could be exchanged between other Liberty Reserve customers, for anything from hacking services to stolen credit card information to drugs. One undercover agent, listing his name as ""Joe Bogus,"" went so far as to classify his transactions as ""for the cocaine,"" without attracting notice. Liberty Reserve charged a one percent fee for every transaction, far below any bank rate, and a 75 cent privacy fee to ensure untraceability. ""Once it gets into the e-currency model, it's untraceable. It's just a number,"" said Sood. To withdraw money, the process was reversed, with the Liberty Reserve currency going back to a money exchanger who then turned it into any standard currency -- dollars, euros, rubles. ""You don't have to be technology-savvy to do this,"" said Sood. ""With Liberty Reserve, you simply reserved your account."" Hackers were among those who took full advantage of Liberty Reserve. One group used it to wash and divide proceeds from a $45 million heist of two Middle Eastern banks. That group, whose suspected ringleader was shot dead in the Dominican Republic in April, hacked into prepaid debit cards, raised their limits, and then pulled out enormous sums at ATMs around the world. Sood said other hackers had even targeted Liberty itself, exploiting a hole in the system that set off ""money warfare among the cybercriminals."" Liberty Reserve was incorporated in 2006 in Costa Rica by Arthur Budovsky, an American who renounced his citizenship after marrying a Costa Rican national in 2008. Budovsky was arrested last week in Spain, and the Associated Press has since reported that he may have paid his Costa Rican wife to marry him as a way to gain citizenship in a country that lacks an extradition treaty with the United States. Before moving to Costa Rica in 2006, Budovsky and his partner Vladimir Kats -- also arrested and charged in the indictment -- were prosecuted for running an unlicensed money transmitting business that used E-Gold, a popular digital currency that is now defunct. The US government has seized a number of bank accounts worldwide, worth $25 million, that belonged to Budovsky, Kats, and other defendants in the case. Including Budovsky and Kats, a total of seven former and current employees of Liberty Reserve were charged in the indictment, including four from Costa Rica. Two of the Costa Ricans charged remain at large. Juan Carlos Esquivel, a Costa Rican lawyer and expert on international money laundering, told InSight Crime that nothing about Costa Rica's e-commerce laws would have made Costa Rica more attractive to Budovsky than other countries. ""It could have been Panama, Guatemala, or any island in the Caribbean,"" he said. ""Obviously there could have been more regulations, but with money laundering you are always one step behind."" For anyone with money in Liberty Reserve when the company was taken down, it is likely gone forever, Sood said. But the shutdown of Liberty Reserve does not signal the end of digital currencies being used to launder money: far from it, say experts. Brian Krebs, a former Washington Post journalist and cyber security analyst, wrote on his blog that the cyber crime underground has already turned its attention to figuring out ""what virtual currency would be the safest going forward."" Krebs expects the Russia-based WebMoney will be the likeliest to prosper in the short term. What's likely to emerge over time, Krebs wrote , are more independently run, forum-specific currencies and exchanges without ties to a particular country, or based in countries hostile or cool to the United States. And then there is the question of Bitcoin, another digital currency that has been grabbing headlines for its wild swings in value. But Bitcoin is very different from Liberty Reserve, WebMoney, or the Panama-based Perfect Money. These virtual currencies are pegged to the U.S. dollar, whereas Bitcoin is a currency wholly invented by an anonymous hacker. The Bitcoins themselves -- which are in no way hard coins but bits -- can be transferred in a peer-to-peer network of users, without resorting to a centralized system such as Liberty Reserve had. There are currently about 11 million Bitcoins in circulation. ""Bitcoin can't be shut down. It is a distributed protocol for moving bits around,"" Nicolas Christin, a computer and information security researcher and professor at Carnegie Mellon University, told InSight Crime in an email. ""That those bits are assigned a monetary value has nothing to do with the protocol itself, but with market forces."" In theory, Bitcoin could be used to launder money: it provides anonymity, which is why it is popular among customers of Silk Road, a $1.2 million-a-month online marketplace for illegal drugs. Bitcoin's coding traces the movement of every coin as a fraud-protection measure, but special ""laundries"" of Bitcoins have been set up to obscure this tracing feature. Still, the same market forces that cause Bitcoin values to fluctuate make it a less attractive option for launderers. Will Bitcoin exchanges be targeted next? There's some evidence to suggest so. The largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, had its US accounts seized recently because it was not in compliance with anti-money laundering laws for money transmitters. ""Whether, in practice, Bitcoin could survive without functioning semi-central exchanges, like Mt. Gox, is anyone's guess, but the protocol provides flexibility,"" Christin said. Clearly the US government is applying the narcotics model -- that is, going after the illicit money first, as it will be difficult, if not impossible, to target the criminals themselves. Sood explained that the users of Liberty Reserve were so well hidden through false identities and the untraceable virtual currency that ""it's hard to figure out who to prosecute."" And they will move on to other virtual currencies that will be much more complex. ""It's an arms race,"" he said."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Imprisoned Guatemala Ex-President Rejected US Plea Deal in 2010. Declassified US State Department cables document how Alfonso Portillo, the former president of Guatemala who recently pled guilty to money-laundering charges in New York, refused a plea deal following his arrest to chance his arm in the corrupt Guatemalan justice system. Hours after Portillo's arrest in January 2010, Stephen McFarland, then US Ambassador to Guatemala, met with Carlos Castresana, head of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), to discuss the arrest of Portillo and the offers made to him to accelerate the judicial process, reported Plaza Publica. A cable sent to the Department of State in Washington says Portillo had been presented a choice: He could accept a reduced sentence in Guatemala for his embezzlement of state funds during his presidency, return the 3 million Euros discovered in his family's European bank accounts, and be extradited to the US to face money-laundering charges. Or, he could remain in detention in Guatemala City's dangerous Zone 18 Prison while he contested criminal charges and extradition. According to Castresana, Portillo immediately rejected voluntary extradition to the US, saying he would make his case in Guatemala. Four other declassified cables also clearly show how the US Embassy was intimately involved with the legal case against Portillo and the work of CICIG, reported Plaza Publica. One cable (pdf) , however, said this had implications for Embassy security, as Portillo was accusing McFarland of conspiring against him as retribution for not having supported the Iraq war. Adding to these concerns, the cable refers to an incident in March 2010, when an anonymous caller claimed to have control over the three judges hearing the case of the US extradition request, and that he would kill their families if the case was not suspended. However, the judges verified their families were safe and the hearing continued. Despite the strong evidence against him , Portillo was acquitted in May 2011 of stealing $15 million of state funds during his presidency. It would be another two years before he was finally extradited to the US , where he recently pleaded guilty to charges of accepting bribes and money laundering. Portillo's decision not to immediately accept a plea reflects the inefficiency and corruption in Guatemala's justice system. Portillo opted to try his luck in Guatemala, and the decision proved the right one -- he won his case. However, he is not taking the same chances in the US, pleading guilty after more than likely cooperating with authorities and reaching a deal with prosecutors.	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
Colombian Gangs Battle It Out in Venezuela. Two of Colombia's most powerful drug trafficking organizations have taken their war across the border into Venezuela, eager to secure crossing points and influence in this crucial transit nation. Four people were killed, two of them Colombian nationals, in a clash between rival gangs in the Venezuelan municipality of Pedro Maria Urena , in the border state of Tachira. The area borders a national park, and is a staging post for drug shipments heading into the Venezuelan interior, having crossed from Colombia. The two Colombians killed were believed to belong to the Urabenos , a powerful Colombian gang that dominates that nation's Caribbean Coast. The other side in the firefight were likely from their rivals the Rastrojos. Both groups are fighting a battle across Colombia for control of movement corridors and departure points for drug shipments. Venezuela is now the principal transit nation for Colombian cocaine, with up to 200 tons passing through on its way to US and European markets. With the rise of powerful Mexican gangs and their control over the US market, Colombians have increasingly turned their attention towards Europe, and Venezuela is the bridge to the Old World. The Venezuelan border states of Apure, Tachira and Zulia, all have registered presence of Colombian transnational criminal (TCOs), primarily the Urabenos, but also that of rebel groups of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) and the National Liberation Army ( ELN ). 	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Colombia Police Director Resigns Amid Prostitution Scandal. A sex scandal involving the Colombian police is unfolding at a politically sensitive time, as the force prepares to assume a key role in implementing an expected peace accord between the government and the country's largest rebel group. The director of Colombia's National Police, Rodolfo Palomino, announced his resignation on Wednesday, the day after prosecutors said they would open an investigation into his alleged involvement in a prostitution ring operating within the police ranks, among other accusations. According to testimony from current and former members of the police, officers pressured cadets to perform sexual services in exchange for money and other favors. Local media outlets have reported that the clients of the so-called ""Community of the Ring"" included high-ranking police officers and members of Congress. While Palomino has denied any wrongdoing, this is not the first time he has been implicated in a sex scandal. Three police officials retired late last year after a recording surfaced that appeared to show them pressuring an officer not to pursue accusations that Palomino had solicited sexual favors from him nearly two decades ago. Prosecutors say their investigation of Palomino also extends to allegations of illicit enrichment, stemming from recent media reports raising questions about how the former police director acquired large tracts of valuable property. Additionally, the Attorney General's office is looking into claims that the police illegally spied on several well-known journalists investigating the prostitution scandal, and whether Palomino knew about or participated in those alleged activities. Palomino's resignation comes just over a month before the self-imposed March 23 deadline for a final ceasefire agreement between the government and guerrilla group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). Should a peace deal be reached, the ongoing scandal surrounding the ""Community of the Ring"" could prove an unwelcome distraction for a police force expected to play a crucial role in implementing the expected accord. The scandal is also a black mark on the record of a police force widely seen as a model for the region. The Colombian police have participated extensively in training foreign security forces in recent years, and are largely viewed as less corrupt and more effective in combating organized crime than other police forces across the region. However, the growing evidence of misbehavior by officers at the highest levels of the force could diminish that reputation."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Despite Peace Talks, FARC Continue Attacks. Despite being about to enter formal peace talks with the Colombian government, the FARC guerrillas are continuing their campaign of violent attacks, which could derail the negotiations if the rebels go too far. On October 14, members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) shut down a main road which goes over the border with Venezuela from the Colombian department of Norte de Santander. On the same day, rebels destroyed two electric towers in the province, in attacks that were apparently the work of the FARC's 33rd Front. Also on October 14, elements of the FARC's 10rd Front attacked a column of soldiers in the eastern department of Arauca, killing two civilians in the crossfire, according to military officials. Both incidents occurred days before FARC leaders are scheduled to meet with representatives of the Colombian government in Oslo, Norway to begin formal peace talks on October 17. The fact that the FARC has continued to carry out violent attacks ahead of peace talks is not surprising, as the Colombian government rejected the rebels' calls for a ceasefire in the lead-up to the dialogue. The attacks could help the guerrillas strengthen their position at the negotiating table. By continuing their violent campaign, the guerrillas are demonstrating that they are still a serious security threat. This could be an attempt to counter claims that their participation in the peace talks is a sign of weakness, as some analysts have suggested. The danger is that the guerrillas could overplay their hand, which has happened in the past. The last round of peace talks with the government, for instance, ended in 2002 after the FARC took a commercial airplane hostage. In 2006, the government of former President Alvaro Uribe suspended all contact with the FARC when guerrillas detonated a car bomb outside a military academy in Bogota, injuring 23. The FARC's continued use of violence could also indicate something much more dangerous for the prospects of peace in Colombia. It may suggest that the group's central command no longer has the power to control all the elements of the group, a sign that a formal demobilization process may not end the conflict. The FARC's organizational structure is thought to have been eroded in recent years, in part due to the rebels' involvement in criminal activities like drug trafficking, arms trafficking and kidnapping. This was exacerbated by the loss of several key members of the FARC's leading Secretariat, including Guillermo Leon Saenz Vargas, alias ""Alfonso Cano,"" who was considered one of the last remaining political leaders of the group. If this is the case, then the FARC's future could resemble the history of the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia ( AUC ), which demobilized from 2004 to 2006. During this time, a number of paramilitary blocs turned themselves in in name only, continuing their activities without the cover of political ideology. Many of these successor groups went on to become major players in the country's criminal underworld, including heavyweights like the Urabenos , and are referred to as ""criminal bands"" (BACRIM) by the government. However, there is some evidence that the FARC has cut down its violent activity attacks ahead of the planned talks, at least when it comes to attacks on the energy sector, which it has relied on in the past as a show of strength. Colombian state oil company Ecopetrol announced last month that the number of attacks on their facilities had dropped significantly. ""[In September] we had only three attacks, which is nothing compared to the historical numbers,"" Ecopetrol representative Adriana Echeverri told the press. Suspending or cutting down on attacks could help show that the guerrillas are serious about the prospect of peace, something questioned by many in Colombia, and help the talks to move forward."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Paraguay Seizes Largest Ever Cocaine Haul. Over 875 kilos of cocaine disguised as bags of rice were confiscated in Paraguay, close to the borders with Brazil and Argentina, in the largest cocaine seizure in the country's history. Authorities said that the contraband was most likely bound for Europe, via Mozambique, where it would have fetched around $131 million on the street, reports the Associated Press. U.S. drug enforcement officers aided in the seizure after receiving a tip from workers at a river port in the tri-border region between Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina, an area well known for drug trafficking. In 2010 the U.S. government dropped Paraguay from the list of major narcotics-producing countries that send drugs to the U.S. Paraguayan forces seized 1,425 kilograms of cocaine over that entire year, meaning that Wednesday's haul is more half the size of the entire seizures in 2010. As InSight has reported, the trade in marijuana and cocaine through Paraguay is increasingly controlled by Brazilian gangs, who have moved to the neighboring country to evade security forces crackdowns at home. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Ambushes of Police Fuel Fears Over El Salvador Gang Sophistication. Following two highly organized attacks on police carried out by heavily armed street gangs, authorities in El Salvador are warning the gangs have expanded their territorial influence, increased their criminal activities, and acquired more powerful weaponry. On April 4, a police patrol and a police delegation were ambushed in separate attacks 30 minutes apart. In both cases, the attacks, which left one officer dead and three injured, were carried out by gang members armed with M16 assault rifles and 9mm handguns, reported El Pais. Police believe the Barrio 18 gang was responsible. The chief of the National Police (PNC), Rigoberto Pleites, said the sophistication of the attacks suggested the gangs had received weapons training from experts, reported La Prensa Grafica. The ambushes come against a background of rising attacks against police, with 48 so far this year compared to 30 over the same period in 2013, reported El Mundo. In the wake of the attacks, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security issued a statement in which it said police had evidence of an increase in the gangs' criminal activities, territorial expansion, increased penetration of social and civil institutions, a growing role in drug trafficking and that they had acquired military grade weapons. Meanwhile, the country's murder rate has continued to rise, with the first six days of April witnessing 62 murders, bringing the national rate closer to the rate of around 12 per day seen before the truce between the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Barrio 18 gangs came into force in March 2012. According to El Mundo, the police are working on three theories as to what lies behind the ambush that killed the police officer. The first hypothesis is that it was a revenge attack for the recent killing of a gang member in the same municipality. The second is that it is a reaction to an increase in police operations targeting the gangs, and the third is that its intention was to exert pressure on the incoming government. Whether there were any political motives or not, the attacks will certainly increase the pressure on the incoming government, which has yet to release a detailed security plan for the new administration. Throughout the election campaign, President-elect Salvador Sanchez Ceren avoided overtly condemning or condoning the gang truce. However, the growing murder rate, increases in attacks on police and now police statements the gangs have grown in strength throughout the truce mean he will struggle to continue avoiding the issue.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Drug Trafficking Top Issue for Argentinas Presidential Candidates. Responding to public concerns over growing drug activity and violence in the country, Argentina's leading presidential candidates have offered similar -- and somewhat alarming -- solutions to these issues ahead of Sunday's elections. On October 25, Argentina will hold its 2015 general election, with voters going to the polls to elect a new president and legislative representatives. No matter who wins, the elections will usher in a new political era for Argentina; current president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is constitutionally barred from running again, as she has already served two consecutive terms. (Between Cristina and her late husband Nestor Kirchner, Cristina's predecessor, the Kirchners have occupied the presidential office since 2003.) Proposals have particularly focused on militarizing drug policy by increasing the role of state security forces in the fight against drugs. Beyond the significance of electing a non-Kirchner as president for the first time in over a decade, the campaign season has been dominated by a number of key issues. Among these are the country's worsening economic situation; social and agricultural policy; and, of particular concern among Argentinians, security and crime. Indeed, proposals to combat drug activity and drug-related violence in Argentina have prominently figured in the campaigns of the top three presidential contenders. The Candidates' Anti-Drug Policies The top three presidential contenders have all put forward similar solutions for how to confront the growing drug trade in Argentina. Proposals have particularly focused on militarizing drug policy by increasing the role of state security forces in the fight against drug trafficking. All three candidates also agree on the need for creating a new federal agency to investigate drug crimes. Daniel Scioli (Justicialist Party/Front for Victory) Current frontrunner and Kirchner-endorsed Daniel Scioli (Justicialist Party/Front for Victory) has called drug trafficking ""public enemy number one ."" With this backdrop, Scioli, the governor of Buenos Aires province, has promised to triple the number of officers in the national police and navy within the next four years. He has also publicly discussed the idea of creating a local police force to target micro-trafficking. Current Argentine law prohibits the armed forces from being used in domestic policing roles, unless ""the president deems the interior security system to be insufficient."" Last year, however, Scioli suggested the government reassess this prohibition on the army. Sergio Massa (Renewal Front) Sergio Massa (Renewal Front) has been similarly vocal in his demands for tougher anti-drug policies, calling drug trafficking a ""national security risk."" His proposals include using the police and army to militarize areas "" currently held by drug traffickers ."" Massa also proposed increasing the use of radars, giving the military permission to shoot down suspected drug planes, and using drones to detect drug shipments crossing the border. Mauricio Macri (Republican Proposal) Current Mayor of Buenos Aires Mauricio Macri (Republican Proposal) has also placed illicit drugs at the center of his platform, saying that, if elected, defeating drug trafficking would be one of his three major challenges. Macri's drug policy advisor, Eugenio Burzaco , has called for a ""comprehensive re-engineering"" of national security. And, like Massa, Macri favors shooting down planes suspected of transporting illegal drugs. Candidates Reflect Public Anxiety The three candidates' anti-drug policy proposals reflect widespread alarm among Argentinians over the country's growing role in the regional drug trade. The Catholic University of Argentina found that between 2010 and 2014, public awareness of neighborhood drug sales increased by 50 percent. Another recent study found that eight out of 10 Argentinians believe drug trafficking and drug abuse are a ""serious problem"" in the country. Of those surveyed, half recommend ""harsher laws"" to tackle the problem. The "" Cocaine Rice "" and "" White Charcoal "" scandals -- two recent, high-profile drug trafficking cases -- have likely contributed to heightened perceptions of drug trafficking in the run-up to Sunday's election. During the campaign, a number of scholars and drug experts called on politicians to hold a ""serious debate"" on drug policy. Argentina's Observatory for the Prevention of Drug Trafficking (OPRENAR) also recently sent a document to the top three candidates, outlining steps the next president should take to confront drug trafficking. The three candidates' anti-drug policy proposals reflect widespread alarm among Argentinians over the country's growing role in the regional drug trade. The Argentinian public has reason to be worried. In recent years, organized crime and drug trafficking have become increasingly prevalent. Foreign drug trafficking organizations, especially Colombian groups , have established a growing presence in Argentina, using the country as a hideout and a launching point for international drug shipments destined for Europe. This increase in drug activity has paralled a rise in violence , as competing criminal groups battle for control of Argentina's increasingly lucrative domestic drug market. Militarization: An Inevitable Outcome? Although they appear to be largely in line with the public's priorities, the candidates' proposals for militarizing the fight against drugs evokes alarm. Evidence suggests the militarization of domestic security -- a popular choice among governments across Latin America -- is detrimental to human rights and has little overall impact on crime and violence in the long term. The candidates' rhetoric also runs contrary to steps taken under the Kirchner administration to decriminalize drug use and phase out the military's participation in the fight against drug trafficking. Yet the convenience of using the military to fight crime and the desire for quick, demonstrable results may prove too tempting for Argentina's next president, especially since all the top candidates have pledged to be tough on crime. As such, Sunday's elections may do more than just usher in a post-Kirchner political era in Argentina. It could very well mark the beginning of a new, more militarized security strategy as authorities attempt to tackle the country's burgeoning drug trade."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Under Calderon, 80% of Federal Organized Crime Detainees Went Free. Of more than 600,000 people detained in operations against organized criminal groups during former Mexican president Felipe Calderon's six years in power, some 80 percent went free, according to official figures. From Calderon's inauguration in December 2006 to the end of October 2012, 623,213 people were detained by Mexico's federal forces as part of their fight against organized crime, the Attorney General's Office (PGR) told Excelsior. The majority of those arrested, 498,570, were freed, either because of a lack of evidence or because they were let out on bail. The Attorney General's Office only managed to establish that 5,608 of the suspects were part of organized criminal groups. As Excelsior points out, the figures are inconsistent with those provided by other government institutions such as the Defense Department (Sedena), which reported that over 50,000 people linked to criminal groups had been captured in that period. The statistic of 80 percent freed is an illustration of the high impunity rates in Mexico, but can also indicate an overeagerness by law enforcement official to capture suspects without enough solid evidence. In September, a report from the Attorney General's Office said that of some 3,439 people arrested on drug trafficking charges between 2006 and 2011, only 31 percent were convicted. The figures also highlight the fact that even when the military and federal police are sent to combat drug trafficking organizations, as they were under Calderon's presidency, their power to carry out operations and detain suspects means little in the absence of an effective justice system to make sure that those captured go to trial. As InSight Crime has pointed out , a cycle of arresting and then releasing members of gangs could even be worse than not arresting them in the first place, as these individuals are held together for short periods of time in poor facilities, creating ""universities of crime"" where they form connections with one another. New President Enrique Pena Nieto, who took office on December first, has promised to push ahead with reforms to the judicial system begun under Calderon."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Calls for Americas-Wide Police Purge. El Salvador's President Mauricio Funes called for a clean-up of police forces across the Americas, to break links to organized crime and help build regional cooperation. Speaking at a summit of the American Police Community ( AMERIPOL ), a regional policing body, Funes said ""we cannot tolerate enemy infiltration in our police institutions,"" reports the Associated Press. The president said that it was necessary to wipe out corruption in law enforcement across the continent, in order to create an ""authentic community"" of cooperation and intelligence sharing The Salvadoran leader said that his country is working to purify its police force. Funes' statements coincided with a meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS) in San Salvador , at which members debated a plan to increase regional cooperation to fight organized crime.

The ELN Gets Richer, Stronger in Southern Bolivar. The ELN has gained strength in a crucial drug trafficking region in the southern part of Colombia's Bolivar department -- confirming that they have benefited from the demobilization of rival guerrilla force, the FARC. Located in the center of Colombia, the southern part of Bolivar offers easy access to multiple regions of the country, as well as two key borders for drug trafficking routes: Panama and Venezuela. Moreover, the region has vast coca crops and convenient transportation for drugs along the Magdalena River. It is also home to the San Lucas mountain range, a hotspot for illegal mining. SEE ALSO : ELN Profile and News The combination of vast criminal wealth and the demobilization of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) has brought the southern Bolivar region battles among criminal groups, which include the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN), the Urabenos, and dissident members of the FARC. Historically, the presence of the ELN in the municipalities of southern Bolivar is hardly a novelty. The group has been in the area since the late 1960s when it expanded there after being founded in San Vicente de Chucuri in northern Santander. Originally, ELN territory extended as far as the San Lucas mountains, a natural border between Bolivar and Cesar departments and a protected enclave. Twice, the ELN has seen major challenges to its dominance over the area: the FARC guerrillas starting in the 1980s, and the paramilitary group United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC) in the early 2000s. Recently, the ELN guerrillas have assumed complete control over the municipalities Simiti, San Pablo, Santa Rosa del Sur and Cantagallo. These areas collectively account for around 5,000 of the 6,100 hectares of coca cultivation reported in Bolivar in 2017. The ELN has also set up cocaine processing labs, using the convenient Magdalena River to ferry troops and drugs from these towns to the northern Caribbean coast. In addition to the above, the ELN has set up illegal gold mining operations in San Lucas. Five mining sites seized in 2016 were estimated to bring in a combined two billion Colombian pesos ($620,000) a year. Information obtained by InSight Crime during fieldwork in southern Bolivar showed that the situation there could deteriorate in a similar way to parts of Antioquia and Cordoba, where groups such as the Urabenos, Los Caparrapos , the ELN and ex-FARC mafia all vie for control. But the criminal bonanza may have fostered temporary truces between the ELN and the Urabenos, allowing them to split profits from the cocaine and mining businesses and reduce armed conflict in southern Bolivar. An example of these truces took place in Simiti, where InSight Crime confirmed that the ELN controls coca crops while the Urabenos are in charge of cocaine production and transport.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Drones Are Limited Weapon Against Illegal Mining in Peru. Peru has deployed drones to some of the country's remote areas to track illegal mining, but using the information to capture and make cases against illegal miners is a challenge. Residents of Madre de Dios, a region of the Amazonian rainforest that borders Brazil and Bolivia, have increasingly begun flying drones to collect evidence on illegal mining. This video, as well as satellite imaging, has been turned over to Peru's special prosecutor on environmental affairs (Fiscalia Especializada en Materia Ambiental -- FEMA) to open investigations, according to a report by the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP). The use of drones was facilitated as part of a comprehensive monitoring project promoted in 2016 by experts from the Association for the Conservation of the Amazon Basin (ACCA). The project's focus is on providing residents with the necessary tools to effectively collaborate in the fight against illegal mining and logging. The Madre de Dios region is the epicenter of Peru's illegal mining and logging crisis. Between 2009 and 2017, more than 64,000 hectares of the Amazon rainforest were destroyed in the region. The government has mobilized major operations against illegal mining there. In June, o ver 5,000 gold miners were removed from La Pampa in Madre de Dios, but mining has continued. Drones have certainly improved data gathering against illegal mining over large areas where direct access is difficult or dangerous. Before adopting the use of drones, local residents patrolled on foot to gather data, running the risk of attack by criminal groups, according to an investigation published by El Comercio. ""Now we avoid immediate run-ins with the offenders, who often become aggressive and could physically harm us,"" a local resident told El Comercio. One major challenge is the lack of coordination between authorities and the locals gathering data. Firstly, prosecutors are struggling to corroborate the information provided to them, since the illegal miners may have moved on by the time a location is visited. This makes filing charges very difficult. ""Ultimately, we arrive to a location, that is generally remote, and we do not find a single person, so then we have an attribution issue because we cannot prove who has been or who are those responsible for the incidents,"" Karina Garay, FEMA's provincial prosecutor in Madre de Dios, told El Comercio. But Garay explained that the information is still useful for documenting criminal patterns. And that explains the current limitations of drones. For now, they serve as a good documentation tool without which authorities would work blindly. But the use of drones itself, and the data they gather, will not be enough without being part of a long-term, comprehensive policing strategy."	0	0	1	0	0	1	0
"Central America Edges Towards Joint Security Strategy. The Central American Integration System's (SICA) annual summits are often heavy on rhetoric and weak when it comes to actual funding or policy commitments. Still, it could be the region's best bet for creating a cohesive response to organized crime. On June 28-29, the leaders of the seven nations of Central America and the Dominican Republic gathered for the 39th Leaders' Summit of the Central American Integration System (SICA). One of the main proposals discussed during the summit so far includes a revised regional border security plan , which would update the technology at 18 separate border crossings. Honduran President Porfirio Lobo, who is hosting the meeting in the capital city of Tegucigalpa, has said that the meeting will amount to a ""technical and methodical analysis of regional anti-drug trafficking measures."" Despite this ambitious statement, however, the SICA summit will most likely not result in any major changes to the region's response to organized crime and drug trafficking. Central American leaders issued similarly optimistic statements leading up to last year's meeting, and the summit ended with SICA members approving twenty-two potential projects related to improving citizen security and strengthening law enforcement. However, many analysts -- including InSight Crime -- noted that these were heavy on rhetoric on light on actual commitment. And weak commitment is only one obstacle to a region-wide push against organized crime. Ever since it was created in 1991 with the signing of the Tegucigalpa Protocol , funding has been a major stumbling block for the organization. The 2011 summit resulted in the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank committing a combined $1.5 billion for security programs, but these mostly came in the form of loans and it is unclear how much of this is just a renewal of past pledges. This was the case for an aid package announced by United States Secretary of State Hilary Clinton at the conference. While the Clinton pledged the US to provide the region with $300 million in aid at the SICA meeting , $200 million of this has already been announced by President Barack Obama in a March visit to El Salvador. In SICA's defense, however, its achievements have not been completely rhetorical. Support for a more multilateral response to transnational crime has grown significantly in recent years, and the organization has emerged as an important forum for this movement. As the Brooking Institutions' Kevin Casas-Zamora wrote at the time of the 2011 summit : ""If crafting a regional approach against organized crime is a pressing necessity in Central America, then what emerged from Guatemala, with SICA at its helm, is now the only game in town."" And there is hope that this momentum may be furthered during this year's summit. The Central American Parliament -- the body tasked with furthering SICA's aim of integrating the region as one of ""peace, freedom, democracy and development"" -- has announced that it will propose the expansion of the hitherto toothless Central American Court of Justice to include a panel of judges tasked with ruling on criminal law. This criminal court would be able to investigate, arrest and prosecute criminals, a move which would effectively remove two key advantages for transnational crime in the region: weak border controls and inconsistent law enforcement across countries. As it stands, an individual accused of a crime in one Central American nation often simply has to cross a border to evade capture. This was illustrated recently in the case of two individuals accused of running a precursor chemical smuggling in El Salvador and Guatemala; while the men are wanted by police in El Salvador, there are no current investigations into their activity in Guatemala. Because of cases like this, the idea of a regional court has been supported by several analysts, including the director of the celebrated International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), Francisco Dall'Anese. In May, Dall'Anese told InSight Crime that he believed such a measure would be a major boost to the rule of law in Central America. ""Some cases are beyond the capacity of one country, either for economic or structural reasons, due to a lack of institutional power, and for political reasons,"" he explained. A supra-national judicial body could overcome this problem, but only if the region's countries tighten up their own justice systems. As the mixed success of the CICIG shows, international help is often helpless without accompanying domestic reforms. If Central America's leaders want to effectively crack down on organized crime and insecurity, a regional court will only be a first step in a process that will have to include confronting the policy inertia, institutional weakness and funding constraints that have plagued the region for decades.

"Killings by Sao Paulo Police Hit 10-Year High. Killings by Sao Paulo state security forces are on the rise, once again highlighting police violence in Brazil and the culture which encourages it. Police in the southeastern Brazilian state killed 358 people during the first half of 2015, the highest figures in a decade, local newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported, citing figures from the state's Public Security Secretary. The statistics follow reports of a series of murders, which some suspect of being carried out by police death squads. On August 13, at least 18 people were killed in Sao Paulo's namesake capital city, in a series of shootings which took place over three hours. According to some witnesses, the assailants targeted people with criminal histories. Other reports said that bullet casings associated with ammunition used by security forces were found at the murder scenes. The mayor of one affected Sao Paulo suburb went so far as to say the killings may have been reprisals for the recent deaths of two police officers. While more details have yet to emerge about the killings in Sao Paulo, it would not be outrageous to consider the possibility that police death squads were involved. A 2014 study found that Sao Paulo state military police have killed more than 10,000 people since 1995. There is also a strong precedent for off-duty police committing killings , and prior examples of police becoming embroiled in tit-for-tat assasinations with prison gang the First Capital Command (PCC). It remains to be seen whether the 18 murders in Sao Paulo will unleash a cycle of revenge killings between gangs and police, as previously seen in the city in 2012. Brazil's police have frequently been accused of fostering ""a culture of violence"" and failing to do enough to address the issue of brutal policing, as highlighted in a recent report by Amnesty International. Police reliance on use of excessive and illegal force has been blamed on the brutal training that recruits undergo. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Mexicos Scaled Down Gendarmerie to Protect Industry. Mexico's Gendarmerie has been slated to begin operations as a force dedicated to protecting industries threatened by organized crime. The plans represent a significant scaling down of the size and role initially foreseen for the body. According to Mexico's Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido, the National Gendarmerie will begin operating this month with 5,000 members, with plans to double this number in the future, reported EFE. The new force will be responsible for protecting the ""productive chains"" of crops such as limes in Michoacan state or tomatoes in Sinaloa state, by monitoring the harvesting, transport and sales processes. The gendarmes will also provide support in mining regions, reported Prensa Latina. Federal Police Commissioner Enrique Galindo told EFE the decision was part of a ""paradigm shift"" aimed at providing security for a sector that had until now not been adequately protected from organized crime. The first members of the new force were chosen out of over 100,000 applicants based on the results of rigorous testing, according to officials. President Enrique Pena Nieto made the creation of the Gendarmerie a key element of his security policy since campaigning in the 2012 elections. The original plans were for a 40,000 strong force that would carry out various functions primarily in rural areas. More recently, the body was described as a kind of "" super-police "" that would have rotating responsibilities depending on security needs at a given time. However, questions dogged the proposal from the beginning. Which state entity would finance and provide the soldiers for the force -- which was intended to be a joint military-civilian initiative? Why even create a new force when you have a large national police and military working on citizen security matters? The current proposal represents a drastic scaling-down of the Gendarmerie, in both size and remit. And the security triumph Pena Nieto -- whose security policies have not brought him popularity with the Mexican people -- might have hoped for when he launched the idea during the campaign seems to have run into a political reality: the government cannot afford to have another sizeable, national security force that competes with the police and the military. The revised role of the force also suggests the government is reacting to recent evolutions in organized crime and security, and in particular the rise of vigilante movements. The extortion of lime and avocado farming and mining by the Knights Templar in Michoacan was one of the main factors spurring the growth of self-defense militias, suggesting the government may now be using the Gendarmerie to address the root causes of the vigilante movement -- or at least win some political capital -- in an attempt to deter the formation of more such groups, which have challenged the state's authority ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"The Top Three Security Challenges Facing El Salvadors President-Elect Nayib Bukele. It is straight to business for El Salvador's president-elect Nayib Bukele as he faces unparalleled expectations when it comes to tackling the country's security policy. Some sources close to the president are giving the impression that Salvadorans will see daring, new proposals, but others fear Bukele will fall back on tried and not so true policies that have promised much but delivered little. InSight Crime delves into three of the major issues affecting El Salvador's public security and anti-crime efforts , which the new president will have to deal with upon taking a seat in his office at the presidential palace. 1. Gang Activity Within the plan presented during his campaign, Bukele published a National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil - PNC) document that was supposed to be restricted from public view. It was a map showing the Salvadoran territory under control of the two dominant gangs: the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Barrio 18. A PNC official told InSight Crime on condition of anonymity that the Bukele team received the information from someone within the PNC. An investigation has been opened to discover who was responsible for the leak, according to Diario El Mundo. Bukele's plan describes the criminal landscape in El Salvador in crystal clear terms that have been obvious to Salvadorans for over a decade and a half: the gangs have been expanding their control through extortion and the indiscriminate use of violence in large swaths of the country for years. ""The expansion of these criminal groups is undeniable, as is the impact on the lives of ordinary citizens,"" the plan states. The two administrations prior to Bukele's belonged to the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional - FMLN). Both of them opted for widespread ""mano dura"" (""iron fist"") policies that included instituting so-called extraordinary measures in the prisons and giving the police free rein when pursuing gang members in the streets. From the latter sprung a new version of the death squads that had plagued the country in its more turbulent years -- this time embedded in the police force. However, the maps published by the Bukele team showed that the mano dura policies changed little; the territorial control of the gangs remains intact today. One figure that has improved is the homicide rate, which dropped by 15 percent in 2018. The start of the year saw a spike in killings that included several murders of police officers, but official reports show that by the end of January daily homicides had decreased to nine, then to seven so far this month. Though authorities blame most of El Salvador's murders on the gangs, Bukele has shown a willingness to find ways to manage them. When he was mayor of San Salvador, Bukele and his advisors held talks with gangs in order to ensure government presence in some of the capital's hardest hit neighborhoods, according to a June 2018 report published by El Faro. 2. Police Reform Since 2015, the Salvadoran justice system has prosecuted half a dozen cases in which high-ranking members of the police force, soldiers and other officials have been accused of homicide, attempted homicide, intimidation, torture and other crimes. President-elect Bukele's security plan, however, continues to emphasize the repressive component of the PNC and maintains the military's active role in criminal intelligence work and public security. Still largely unknown is what action the new government will take to effectively purge both armed institutions of the actors corrupting them, especially the PNC. What will soon be known, though, is the names of the police officials who will be appointed to head the PNC and if any of them carry past accusations against them. Another sign of what can be expected from the Bukele administration is what happens to Defense Minister David Munguia Payes. The intelligence apparatuses that General Payes currently runs have been linked to extrajudicial executions and other crimes. Many will be watching closely to see how much power he wields under the new president. 3. Corruption During the campaign, Bukele's team focused heavily on how it will address corruption. Starting in October 2018, allusions were made to the creation of an international anti-graft commission akin to Guatemala's International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG). But Bukele made clear his intention to tackle corruption with a similar entity in the speech he gave the night of February 3, the day he officially won the presidential election with close to 54 percent of the vote. He and his advisors now have a more concrete proposal for what they are calling the International Commission Against Impunity in El Salvador (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en El Salvador - CICIES). However, there may also be cause for concern. Accusations of corruption and regulatory violations weigh on Bukele himself, and El Salvador's politicians and business elites are bound to resist any anti-graft body. Local politicians have already expressed reluctance to create such a commission, including Bukele's fellow members of the political party he ran under, the Grand Alliance for National Unity (Gran Alianza por la Unidad Nacional - GANA). Some of them have been investigated for alleged illicit enrichment. What's more, El Salvador's main business association made a statement insisting that a CICIES is unnecessary. The business class was perhaps worried after witnessing the CICIG investigations unfold in Guatemala against some of that country's elites. In response, Bukele's colleagues were quick to downplay his affiliation with GANA -- which has already been known for past corruption -- saying it was simply a vehicle to the presidency. They added that the president-elect will have plenty of space to sidestep any obstacles intended to impede projects like the CICIES. With the elections over and Bukele's presidency set to begin, it is now time to keep tabs on his first steps, not only in establishing his proposed anti-graft commission, but also in how he decides to combat El Salvador's insecurity, crime and violence."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Businesses in Honduran Capital Beseiged By Crime, Extortion. More than 90 percent of businesses in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa have experienced security threats, mostly in the form of extortion, highlighting the stranglehold criminal gangs have on the country's economy. A survey among Tegucigalpan business owners revealed that nearly all had suffered security problems ranging from theft to frequent threats by criminal groups demanding money in exchange for safety, Mario Bustillo, head of the city's chamber of commerce, told Honduran daily La Tribuna. Most businesses in Tegucigalpa are small-to-medium sized, according to the chamber's report, leaving them more vulnerable to extortion. Criminal gangs like the MS-13 and Barrio 18 , both of which have operations in Tegucigalpa, are known to rely heavily on extortion as a key source of funding. The practice has taken its toll on Honduras's economy: A July survey by Honduran newspaper El Heraldo found that a third of Tegucigalpa businesses had folded or fled to Nicaragua because of extortion demands. The lost businesses would result in lowered government tax revenue and higher unemployment, Bustillo noted. Unemployed youth, in turn, provide ready recruits for gangs extorting the city's businesses, police commissioner Alex Villanueva stated. Honduras has attempted to combat extortion on a variety of fronts. Police have set up telephone hotlines for businesses to report threats anonymously but at the same time police agents are suspected by many of participating in the extortion rackets. The government also recently announced a deal with a group of international investors allowing them to construct three privately run cities in the country -- with services including a private security force and judicial system -- as potential safe-havens for companies. But, as InSight Crime reported in July, gangs have adopted new extortion tactics in response to police efforts to quell the practice. MS-13 members, for instance, wear smart business attire to infiltrate upscale enterprises and later extort them. And recent reports indicate the problem has broadened beyond the scope of businesses. Gangs have begun to extort Honduran individuals, too, demanding payments for allowing them to live safely in their own homes, the Associated Press reported in June .	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Guatemalas New Narco-map: Less Zetas, Same Chaos. Since the rise and subsequent fall of the Zetas, Guatemala's underworld has experienced a tremendous upheaval. The turmoil has left a number of smaller groups to battle with each other, most of which are trying to satisfy the insatiable appetite of the remaining powerhouse in the region: the Sinaloa Cartel. By 2011, the bells were tolling for Guatemala, a country that seemed on the verge of succumbing to the terrible plague of the Zetas. Mexico's most violent and divisive group tore through the provinces of Peten to the north, and Huehuetenango and Quiche to the west, in an effort to establish control of what remains a vital chokepoint in Central American drug trafficking routes. An estimated 350 tons of cocaine passes through this nation of 15 million people, according to foreign law enforcement. The $2,000 to $2,500 per kilo the local transport groups can collect for moving it through this country make it close to a billion dollar market. For their part, the Zetas need Guatemala as a reception and purchase point. Unlike their main rivals, the Sinaloa Cartel, the Zetas do not have strong contacts in the source countries, and purchase their cocaine mostly in Guatemala and Honduras, financial records obtained by InSight Crime show. In essence, the Zetas sought to monopolize this chokepoint for themselves. However, it did not work. The Zetas' offensive -- which began in 2008 and included the assassinations of traditional power brokers Juancho Leon, Haroldo Leon, and Giovanny Espana; threats against political powers such as the family of Manuel Baldizon; the assassination of a prosecutor; and the massacre of 27 farmworkers at Raul Otto Salguero's ranch in Peten -- stirred the Guatemalan underworld and opened an opportunity for the government. Information began flowing in, often from rivals, but sometimes from would-be allies, and following a bloody rampage in May 2011, the government directed its resources towards reining in this organization. The results are a powerful illustration of the importance of political will and good local intelligence. Under the skillful direction of Claudia Paz y Paz, the Attorney General's Office began rounding up Zetas. Those arrested were some of the most important members of the organization in Guatemala: Hugo Alvaro Gomez Vasquez, Horst Walther Overdick and Abner Milian Quijada, to name a few. Others were arrested in Mexico, including William de Jesus Torres Solorzano, alias ""W,"" the financial head of the group in Guatemala, and Mauricio Guizar Cardenas, alias ""El Amarillo"" or ""Z200."" The Zetas have since lost their top leader, Miguel Trevino, alias ""Z40,"" who was captured in July in Mexico , and the group is struggling to maintain a cohesive structure. In all, over 100 were jailed. Overdick represented the most important as he provided the infrastructure of the political, social and financial pieces of the group. He was extradited to the United States where the presumption is that he has helped authorities outline what is left of the group. Gomez Vasquez was the muscle. In 2012, he and 35 others were found guilty in a Guatemalan court and each sentenced to between 2 and 158 years in prison. New and Old Groups Fill Vacuum The resulting vacuum has been filled quickly and ably, in part by the traditional transport groups, in part by new groups, some of whom worked closely with what is left of the Zetas, who remain a big buyer of cocaine but have less of a physical and psychological presence. The most important of these groups is run by Jairo Orellana Morales, alias ""El Pelon."" Orellana comes from a network that began under the wing of the Lorenzanas, an infamous trafficking and contraband family that included Mario Ponce Rodriguez and Carlos Andres Alvarenga. He has a child with Marta Lorenzana, the daughter of the family patriarch, Waldemar Lorenzana, and may still work with what is left of that organization, although his relations with Alvarenga have apparently soured. These days, Orellana is more often associated with the Zetas, but allegedly bristles at this notion as well. To be sure, Orellana considers himself independent, and there are many indications that this perception is accurate. Ponce was captured in Honduras in 2012, and after being extradited to the United States was found guilty of drug trafficking in a Miami court and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Alvarenga is on the run. A recently converted protestant preacher (authorities once tacked wanted signs on his church in Izabal), he allegedly spends most of his time in neighboring Honduras now. The top Lorezanas have been captured and extradited to the United States, including Waldemar. Guatemalan and foreign law enforcement believe Orellana is the Zetas' principal cocaine supplier. He may also sell to the Sinaloa Cartel, another sign that the Zetas' strategy of monopolizing this chokepoint has largely failed. In a way, Orellana's success was as much about luck as skill. The Guatemalan government, with strong US support, has effectively cut international air traffic, all of which appears to be moving through Honduras, and arrivals via the Pacific have slowed, local law enforcement said. The shift has made the land entry via places like El Florido, along the Honduran border, a critical corridor and increased the revenues of operators like Orellana who control it. For their part, the Zetas are still major buyers, even though they are a shell of what they were, Guatemala and foreign intelligence officials told InSight Crime. At the center is alias ""Yanki"" (or ""Yanqui""), who operates between Zacapa, Alta Verapaz and Peten. However, the Zetas can no longer push around the competitors, some of whom have much deeper pedigrees in the Guatemalan underworld. Chief among these is the Mendoza family. The International Crisis Group calls the family one of ""the untouchables."" There are still no charges against anyone in the family in Guatemala or the United States, but law enforcement officials and analysts agree that the family is a mainstay of the underworld, with a sizeable control over one of the country's main trafficking routes from the Izabal province -- running from the Honduras border through Peten. Other traditional families, such as the Lorenzanas and the Espanas, also remain operational although debilitated, law enforcement sources said. In this list, we can include the Ortiz Lopez clan, whose leader Juan Ortiz Lopez, alias ""Juan Chamale,"" was arrested in 2011 and is awaiting extradition. The clan, whose traditional headquarters stretched from Escuintla to San Marcos, is now headed by Juan's brother, Rony, and may, in part, be run from jail by Juan himself, according to Plaza Publica. However, there are also reports that Rony may have lost control of both his brother's territory and his organization, and authorities say that he is on the run in Mexico. Relative newcomers such as the Samayoa clan, referred to as the ""Huistas"" for their home base San Antonio Huista and Santa Ana Huista in Huehuetenango, are filling the void. Their leader, Aler Samayoa, is a longtime contraband trader who has since expanded his network into Guatemala City, where he obtains and moves cocaine through various routes that stretch through the northwest of the country and into Mexico. Samayoa has total control in that corner of the country, local sources tell InSight Crime, but he is under some threats, from a local rival and recent law enforcement efforts to slow the violence in the region. In June, eight police were assassinated , allegedly by members of another trafficking group operating just south of the Huistas. In an effort reminiscent of their operations against the Zetas, authorities struck back quickly, arresting nine members of the so called Villatoro organization, named for their leader, Eduardo Villatoro Cano, alias ""El Guayo."" The other relatively new name in the underworld is Marllory Dadiana Chacon Rossell, who the US Treasury Department placed on its kingpin list last year. In its press release, one US official was quoted as calling her ""a critical figure"" in the Central American distribution chain, with operations in Panama and Honduras. However, when asked, Guatemalan and foreign investigators based in Guatemala did not place her among the most important traffickers. There could be a reason for this designation that goes beyond the size and importance of Chacon. Guatemala's elPeriodico published a long report in April detailing claims of corruption and criminal activity by Guatemala's Vice President Roxana Baldetti, who it says has ties to Chacon. The report, citing anonymous sources, says Chacon made an unexpected appearance at Baldetti's 50th birthday party. Baldetti responded by saying that she is being attacked because she is a woman, and that ""99.5 percent"" of what has been said is false. The Big Buyer: Sinaloa Cartel Despite the upheaval in Guatemala, the main buyer of goods and services in the country remains the Sinaloa Cartel. The Mexican organization continues to do business with nearly every, if not every, Guatemalan transport organization. Its relations with some, such as the Mendozas and the Huistas, stretches back more than a decade, law enforcement officials told InSight Crime. The group also continues to receive and traffic other illicit products, including large quantities of precursor chemicals , according to law enforcement sources. The size of this market became apparent after a series of seizures last year in which 320 barrels of monomethylamine were confiscated by authorities. The seizures coincided with the dismantling of one large and several small methamphetamine laboratories. The movement of the chemicals sometimes confounded reason, with one tracked shipment moving from Mexico to Guatemala and back to Mexico. The reasons why the Sinaloans have triumphed over their rivals go to the heart of what makes them a more important longer-term threat to regional stability, democracy and citizen security than the Zetas. Although violent in its own ways, the organization appears much more willing to develop local alliances and use these alliances to organize secure trafficking routes. These alliances are, as Julie Lopez said in her overview of this very subject for Plaza Publica , ""horizontal"" and numerous, so even when important nodes are removed, the operations continue apace. Lopez, citing official sources, says the Sinaloa organization has also penetrated state forces on a higher level, giving itself more political and judicial top cover than its Zetas rivals. In practice, these numerous alliances also mean more local political and social control, and a greater ability to foresee threats to the business and pre-empt them. In the Huistas' territory, for instance, local operatives have established contacts with national politicians, who have seemingly helped them steer clear of judicial troubles, even though they too have killed police. These types of alliances cost more and may mean less profits per kilo for the Sinaloa Cartel, but they mean more stability and profits over the long term. In contrast, the Zetas are known in the underworld for their inability to make or honor an agreement and their instabilty as an organization. Their volatile ways are not just bad for business, they lead to tremendous social upheaval in their areas of operation and upticks in all types of criminal activities. Huista territory, for example, is known for its relative peace and near zero tolerance for homicides, but the Zetas' headquarters, Coban, has become home to what locals describe as an epidemic of rape and violence against women. Violence Continues Although the Zetas have been somewhat neutralized and the violence associated with their activities has dissipated, violence continues in the country's main trafficking corridors. According to a recent analysis by the Central American Business Intelligence group provided to InSight Crime, the most violent provinces lie along the Honduras border and the southern Pacific coast. (See map below) The intelligence group says Chiquimula, for instance, where Orellana operates, had 90 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2012, far above the country's 34 homicides per 100,000 and putting it on par with the most violent places in the world. Evidence of the scale of these fights was on full display in an exclusive area of Guatemala's capital city in November 2012, when several heavily armed gunmen entered a private clinic in search of Orellana, who was getting plastic surgery. Orellana's security detail heard the shooting just prior to the doctors administering the anesthesia, and Orellana escaped , an anti-drug agent with knowledge of the attack told InSight Crime. But seven of his bodyguards were killed. The dispute, the agent said, was because Orellana had killed one of the man's allies. Others have said Orellana is more a thief than a businessman , which has made him a target of many powerful groups inside and outside of Guatemala. The Pacific coast also has a number of players competing for space, making the provinces of Escuintla and Santa Rosa two of the most deadly places in the country. The traditional clans such as the Sarceno organization , which operates in Escuintla and Santa Rosa, have to compete with smaller organizations that are making pushes for territory. Violence also comes after the theft of drugs or money. In this realm, the police are themselves important players. Some police run their own operations, taking seizures and reselling them on the market to the highest bidder. Others have teamed up with criminal groups such as the Marroquin clan, which is dedicated to theft and resale , and operates west of Guatemala City. Fighting for control of local drug trafficking is also increasing. Guatemala City, where the vast majority of homicides occur, has rising consumption rates and pockets where violence is extremely high. The most prominent local traffickers are known as ""Los Caraduras,"" roughly translated as ""hardheads."" The leaders of the group, identified as the brothers Julio Jaime and Francisco Edgar Dominguez Higueros, run their operations from jail. Finally, more extraditions and increased cooperation of those who are jailed in Guatemala are making for a more violent underworld. The price for collaborating with authorities in any country is high, and suspicions mount as identities of traffickers get revealed and indictments appear in the United States. What's Next Guatemala's underworld will remain a muddy, complicated place in the near future. The current disarray within the Zetas makes it unlikely the organization will make another strong push into Guatemala, but other, smaller Guatemalan organizations, will continue to fight for trafficking corridors, space in the local drug market and fringe-businesses surrounding the two. The violence related to this activity seems unlikely to abate, although there is no reason to believe it will get significantly worse, either. The Sinaloa Cartel will also remain the principal business partner and purchaser of illegal drugs. The horizontal nature of its relationships with the local groups, as well as the number of relationships it has has developed, make the organization a mainstay.

"Canada Drug Trafficking Groups Expanding Mexico Ties. After a spate of killings targeting Canadian drug traffickers in Mexico, there have been several indications that some of Canada's criminal groups have now stabilized their drug supply chain and expanded operations, even increasing cocaine exports to Australia. For a few years, Mexico was a deadly place for Canadian drug traffickers. According to a report from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) accessed by The Canadian Press , at least ten Canadians with alleged criminal ties were shot or killed in Mexico between 2008 and 2012. The victims included three members of the United Nations gang -- a criminal organization based in the province of British Columbia -- and two men who were allegedly affiliated with the Hells Angels motorcycle gang. The deaths during this time period coincided with reports that Canadian criminal groups were increasing their direct connections in Mexico in order to cut the middlemen out of the cocaine trafficking chain. Another indication that the Canadians may have solidified their connections with the Mexicans is that the country has reportedly increased its role as a transshipment point for European and Australia-bound cocaine shipments. The Australian Crime Commission has reported that Canada brings the second highest amount of cocaine into the country after Chile, which serves as the main transit point for cocaine headed to Australia. Canada has climbed up three spots on the list since 2010. Officials told CBC News that Canadian drug traffickers had increased their presence in Australia mainly because of the price of cocaine in the country, where a kilo can be sold for up to five times as much as the going rate in Canada. Tim Wilson, a Canadian journalist based in Mexico who has reported extensively on organized crime, told InSight Crime that drug ties between the two nations are also bolstered by their shared status as Commonwealth countries and a similar gang structure, with biker gangs playing a key role in criminal activity. Canadian drug traffickers have also set up shop in the Philippines. In January, Filipino authorities raided several properties in capital city Manila and seized millions of dollars worth of cocaine, ecstasy, and methamphetamine. During the operation, four Canadians were arrested , two of whom were British Columbia gang members with ties to the Hells Angels and had reportedly used their Mexican cartel contacts to import cocaine. The Storm Before the Calm While ties between criminal groups in Mexico and Canada go back at least twenty years, the RCMP stated in its 2012 report that Canadian groups were looking to increase their cut of the profits by increasingly dealing directly with Mexican cartels. This information is supported by the US State Department's 2013 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), which stated that while the United States continued to be the main transit point for cocaine trafficked into Canada, recent smuggling patterns indicated traffickers were increasingly shipping cocaine directly to the northern country. This strategy initially came at a high price for some of Canada's drug traffickers. Wilson told InSight Crime that the United Nations gang and the Hells Angels used to send low-level operatives or individuals who had lost favor with the group to handle business in Mexico, which helped produce the string of killings between 2008 and 2012. However, things appear to have changed. The murder of Salih Abdulaziz Sahbaz, who was allegedly the United Nations gang's main cartel contact in Mexico, appears to have been the last reported killing of a Canadian drug trafficker ordered by a Mexican cartel. Sahbaz was believed to have been working off a debt from the loss of a cocaine shipment when he was shot as many as nine times in Culiacan, Sinaloa in January 2012. His death was followed by those of two more Canadians with criminal ties: Thomas Gisby, head of the Gisby Crime Group, gunned down in a Nuevo Vallarta Starbucks in April 2012, and Moreno Gallo, a former associate of Montreal's Rizzuto mob, shot in December 2013. However, the circumstances of both cases indicate the assassinations may have been ordered by rival Canadian groups rather than Mexican cartels, partly because both men had had previous trouble in Canada before their deaths. This means as many as two-and-a-half years have passed without a Canadian gangster in Mexico being targeted by a Mexican cartel. Wilson told InSight Crime that he believed the lack of murders targeting Canadian drug traffickers in Mexico in recent years -- as well as the growth of cocaine trafficking in Australia -- indicated that Canadian groups had learned how to deal with Mexican drug cartels and solidified their supply chain. ""When the Canadian gangsters were getting killed in Mexico they were screwing up,"" he told InSight Crime. ""If we can say now that a year has gone by, there's no shortage of cocaine in Canada then in the past year those individuals have become experienced. Things have been very quiet in the past year in terms of Canadian gangsters getting hurt in Mexico and to me that's an indication that business is good."" The Canada-Mexico Connection According to Walter McKay, a former British Columbia police officer who has worked as a security consultant in Mexico, Canadian drug traffickers have had ties to their Mexican counterparts since at least the early 1990s. He told InSight Crime that the groups who worked with Mexican cartels included the Hells Angels, the United Nations gang, and another British Columbia gang called the Red Scorpions. On the Mexican side, Wilson believes Canadian drug trafficking groups mainly do business with Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, an assertion that is supported by the location of the murders of the Canadian drug traffickers, most of whom were killed in areas where the Sinaloa Cartel has a significant presence. Canadian drug trafficking groups run the gamut from street gangs such as the Red Scorpions to highly sophisticated, large-scale operations like the one run by Jimmy Cournoyer, who was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison. Cournoyer, also known as the ""King of Pot,"" worked with the Sinaloa Cartel, the Hells Angels, the Rizzuto mob, and New York's Bonanno crime family to traffic ecstasy and marijuana into New York from Canada, and cocaine northward from Mexico. In total, Cournoyer smuggled an estimated 109 tons of marijuana into the United States. While Cournoyer's operation was based in Montreal, most of the Canadian drug trafficking groups with ties to Mexican cartels operate out of British Columbia. According to McKay, British Columbian groups are more involved in the transnational drug trade because of the Vancouver port, which receives shipments from around the world, and because the province's coastline is extremely difficult to patrol. He told InSight Crime that much of the drug trafficking from Mexico was done via maritime routes, with drugs smuggled in fishing trawlers to the area off British Columbia's coast and then brought to the mainland in smaller vessels like dinghies and speedboats. British Columbia also grows a large portion of the country's marijuana, which likely facilitated the rise of drug trafficking groups that have since expanded into cocaine, heroin, and other narcotics. In 2001, British Columbia's Organized Crime Agency estimated that criminal groups -- as opposed to independent growers -- controlled 85 percent of the province's marijuana trade ( pdf ). In addition to British Columbia's maritime routes, Wilson added that cocaine is also trafficked over land through the United States. ""The Canadian-US border is the longest undefended border in the world,"" he told InSight Crime. ""It's very easy to illegally cross. If you want to bring cocaine into Canada from Mexico -- assuming you already know how to get into the United States -- it's really not hard."" At least, not if you learn the rules of the trade in Mexico, which Canadian groups now appear to have grasped."	1	0	0	1	0	0	1
Rise in Argentina Ecstasy Seizures Suggests Production Migration. Seizures of ecstasy tablets in Buenos Aires increased 2,900 percent between 2011 and 2013, in what could be a sign that the country's growing domestic market for synthetic drugs is leading to a migration of production from Europe to Argentina. In 2011, Buenos Aires police seized approximately 1,700 ecstasy tablets, reported La Nacion. In 2012 this rose to over 11,000 and last year reached approximately 50,000 tablets. Seizure rates were boosted by the discovery of a synthetic drugs production and distribution ring operating in the city in September last year. In one of the sites raided police seized over 20,000 tablets. Recent arrests also highlight how production is not just focused in the capital city. In January, police in the coastal town of Mar de Ajo in Buenos Aires Province raided a laboratory , seizing 700 ecstasy tablets and enough precursor chemicals to make an estimated 600,000 more. While the ecstasy market in Argentina remains fairly small, there are indications that it has grown substantially in the last decade. One 2011 government study recorded lifetime use rates rising from 0.3 percent of the population in 2004 to 0.7 in 2010, with much higher rates for young users. The market is also attractive as ecstasy tablets fetch a much higher price than other drugs that are produced in the region, such as cocaine and marijuana. Most ecstasy was originally imported from Europe, especially the Netherlands, which has been one of the traditional production centers ( pdf ). According to La Nacion, the trade was often handled by European criminals, and was linked to the opening up of cocaine routes transiting through Argentina, as the two commodities could be exchanged. The rapid growth in seizures of ecstasy in Argentina could be indicative of a use rate that is growing quicker than official estimates suggest, but also of a criminal migration in production. By manufacturing ecstasy within the country -- where precursor chemicals are notoriously easy to source -- local criminals can vastly increase their profit margins by cutting out the high costs of paying importers and taking control of the entire chain of production and distribution for themselves.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Comments by Outgoing US Diplomat Highlight Discord on Anti-Drug Policy. The top US diplomat in charge of anti-drug policies abroad attempted to mend bruised relations with key Latin American partners, but instead succeeded in highlighting the confusion in Washington over how to handle drug-related security issues in the region. William Brownfield, the outgoing assistant secretary of the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, held a press conference with regional media outlets on September 22, just over a week before he is set to leave his post. (InSight Crime obtained a rough transcript of the conversation from the State Department.) Against a backdrop of strained diplomatic ties between the United States and its primary Latin American anti-drug partners, the career diplomat appeared to try to mend relationships, emphasizing the quality and importance of regional cooperation on the drug issue. For example, Brownfield skirted a question about the shortcomings of the US-backed, militarized anti-crime strategy adopted by Mexico. When asked if US-Mexico cooperation had failed -- given rising violence in Mexico and a rise in drug-related overdose deaths in the United States -- Brownfield said that he ""hoped not"" for the sake of the bilateral relationship, which he unconvincingly described as ""positive"" under the Trump administration. Brownfield portrayed Mexico's spiking levels of violence as the result of efficient government action, even as he admitted that criminal groups have undermined government control of many areas of the country. He also insisted on maintaining bilateral coordination on anti-drug issues based on the two countries' shared security interests. The outgoing diplomat made similarly reconciliatory comments about Colombia, another crucial US anti-drug partner in the region. Seemingly contradicting recent statements he made during testimony before the US Senate, Brownfield described Colombia's current drug control policy as ""an excellent strategy,"" and said US-Colombian anti-narcotic cooperation is a regional model that should be replicated. When asked if this view contradicted President Donald Trump's recent threat to name Colombia a major drug producing and trafficking country, Brownfield answered that he believed Colombia's eradication efforts to be efficient, but with room for improvement. The outgoing official said he believes that only a combination of traditional interdiction and eradication policies with more progressive, preventative measures would be successful in combatting drug-related security issues. Brownfield's statements suggest that confusion and lack of consensus remain within top US government circles concerning the direction of US anti-narcotic policies in Latin America under the Trump administration. His comments not only appeared to contradict what he has said in the past, but also seem to be at odds with Trump's views. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Drug Policy It is understandable that Brownfield would attempt to paper over the very real differences of opinion between the US and longtime anti-drug partners like Colombia and Mexico as he prepares to leave office. However, those tensions are sure to linger in the transition period before Brownfield's successor is approved. And some experts believe that Trump may choose a replacement with less diplomatic experience and more ""loyalty"" to the president, as he has been counseled to do with other key diplomatic posts."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Will Tony Hernandez Conviction Upend Narco-Politics in Honduras?A jury in a US court has found the brother of the president of Honduras guilty on drug and weapons charges, but serious questions remain about whether this will have an impact on embedded criminal structures in the Central American nation. Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernandez, a former Honduran congressman and the brother of President Juan Orlando Hernandez, was convicted of all four charges against him, including drug trafficking and lying to authorities, authorities announced October 18. President Hernandez reacted to the news on Twitter, saying that he felt ""great sadness"" and that he ""rejected any false and irresponsible version that seeks to stain the name of Honduras as a result of this verdict."" Prosecutors in the trial, which began on October 2 and lasted for two weeks, largely relied on the testimony of a number of traffickers, including the heads of notorious drug clans and government officials, who said that Hernandez provided them protection and handled drug shipments. The traffickers also described how Tony Hernandez funneled millions of dollars in drug proceeds to his brother's campaigns. On Twitter, President Hernandez, once again, pointed the finger at them. ""What can be said about a conviction based on testimonies of confessed murderers?"" he said. Tony Hernandez was arrested in Miami in November of 2018, and over the course of the next year, his long-rumored connections to drug traffickers came to light in court filings. The landmark trial made waves from day one. To set the stage, prosecutor Jason Richman said in his opening statement that former Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias ""El Chapo,"" had hand-delivered $1 million to the former congressman that was meant for the sitting president of Honduras. Allegations of official corruption in facilitating Tony Hernandez's drug conspiracy were a constant feature throughout the trial. One witness, Victor Hugo Diaz Morales, alias ""El Rojo,"" alleged the Honduran police and military played a fundamental role in safeguarding drug shipments and traffickers, including former police chief Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares, known as ""El Tigre."" Another key witness, Amilcar Alexander Ardon Soriano, the former mayor of El Paraiso in the department of Copan in Honduras' "" wild west ,"" claimed to have in 2009 bribed former President Porfirio Lobo and then-congressman Juan Orlando Hernandez with $2 million in drug proceeds to help fund their respective campaigns in exchange for protection and security information. Tony Hernandez's own testimony was used to show his connections to prominent Central American drug traffickers, including leaders from the infamous Valles and Cachiros criminal groups. Former Cachiros head Devis Rivera Maradiaga also testified that he provided drug money to both Tony and Juan Orlando Hernandez. Arguably the most compelling piece of evidence introduced by the prosecution was a ""narcolibreta,"" or ledger, that allegedly detailed cocaine shipments received and distributed by Tony Hernandez. Among the other entries included inside was a $440,000 payment to ""JOH y su gente,"" or JOH and his associates. It was unclear whether the letters were meant to signify the president, but he has long been called by his initials, which are frequently seen on posters in support of and against him. Tony Hernandez now faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years and a possible maximum sentence of life in prison. He will be sentenced on January 17, 2020. The conviction of Tony Hernandez could have only happened in the United States. For more than a decade, the former congressman and his co-conspirators were able to use their connections to Honduras' political elite and corrupt security forces to safeguard their drug trafficking operations. It was only after US prosecutors targeted Hernandez and accused him of being a drug lord that it was made clear he would likely end up in a prison cell. President Hernandez has stressed his commitment to the fight against organized crime in part through extraditing traffickers, many of whom, ironically, ended up testifying against Tony with the hope of receiving shorter prison sentences. But the fact that it took a high-profile trial in the United States to break up one of the most brazen criminal structures Central America has seen in recent years, which featured sitting politicians and policemen among its ranks, suggests that state institutions in Honduras have yet to achieve the autonomy or capacity needed to successfully attack criminal networks. While Tony Hernandez's conviction is extraordinary, it's likely not enough to remove the shadow of narco-politics that still looms over the country's business elites and government, including the president himself. These criminal structures still stand and will continue to do so as long as the United States views the sitting president -- who was named as a co-conspirator in his brother's drug conspiracy -- as an ally worthy of US security assistance ."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Govt and Gangs Claim Credit for Sharp Drop in El Salvador Murders. El Salvador's government has claimed credit for a dramatic drop in homicides last month, but the country's powerful criminal gangs say they are behind the decrease in violence. April saw 352 people murdered in El Salvador at an average of approximately 11 homicides per day, according to police statistics. Overall, this represents a 42 percent drop from the total number of homicides registered in March, reported La Prensa Grafica. As shown in the chart below, produced by investigative news outlet El Faro , not only is April the least violent month El Salvador has registered so far in 2016, it is also the least violent month since before March 2015. Source: El Faro. A top-level security official in El Salvador attributed the drop in homicides to measures taken by the government, in particular efforts to increase control in prisons where leaders of the ""mara"" street gangs the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Barrio 18 are incarcerated, reported La Prensa Grafica. Meanwhile, El Salvador's head of police gave credit to the recent deployment of an elite Special Forces unit against the gangs. In recent months, violence in El Salvador has reached heights not seen since the country was at war. Given the political ramifications, it would be damaging for El Salvador's government to actually admit that they were not responsible for April's sudden drop in this violence, but there is a strong possibility that is the case. It is unlikely the measures taken by the government would have had such a rapid and dramatic impact. While it is true that prisons play a central role in gang structures, even if the government has managed to sever communications between imprisoned leaders and members on the outside, local gang factions are independent enough not to shut down operations simply for a lack of orders from a centralized leadership. The new Special Forces unit, meanwhile, was only deployed towards the end of the month and realistically has not had the time to achieve such startling results. An alternative reason for the fall in violence can be found in the gangs' announcement they would order rank-and-file members to stop killings at the end of March. On April 18, gang leaders put out a statement attributing the fall in murders to this decision. ""The numbers of killings in recent weeks show that we are men of their word and we deliver,"" it read. Given the degree to which El Salvador's homicides fell during the government brokered truce that was launched in March 2012 and began to unravel towards the end of 2013, April's fall in violence may well be more proof that the gangs wield more influence over El Salvador's crime and violence levels than authorities."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Veracruz Massacre Crowns Bloody Start of 2019 in Mexico. An infant was among more than a dozen people killed in a massacre during the heart of Holy Week in Mexico, underscoring the depth of the security challenges facing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. In a grisly scene reminiscent of the most striking violence of Mexico's drug war, gunmen killed 14 people -- including a one-year-old baby -- on April 19 during a family party in the town of Minatitlan in the state of Veracruz along Mexico's Gulf coast, Milenio reported. Before indiscriminately opening fire on those attending the birthday party, between five and six armed men allegedly asked for and tried to kidnap ""La Beky,"" the manager of a local gay bar known as ""La Esquina del Cha-KL,"" who was among those killed in the attack. ""Those who were crouched were told to turn to see the dead [If] you looked at them they told you to turn around. I think they were looking for someone, they aimed at your head or your back with long weapons,"" one witness told Milenio. Authorities allege that two suspected regional drug trafficking leaders from the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion - CJNG) -- identified as alias ""El Lagarto"" or ""El Jarocho"" and alias ""El Pelon"" -- were among those responsible for the slaughter. The incident may have been a revenge attack relating to clashes between the CJNG and Zetas over control of local drug trafficking in the area, according to Animal Politico. Authorities in Veracruz announced in a press release that they are carrying out ballistics tests and pursuing other lines of investigation to apprehend those responsible. Lopez Obrador stressed the urgent need to guarantee security in Veracruz following the attack, adding that the controversial National Guard would help restore calm. Just last month, the CJNG declared war against the government of Veracruz, warning that ""many are going to die."" The rise in homicides to begin 2019 and the latest massacre reaffirms that improving Mexico's security situation won't be an easy fix, even as Lopez Obrador jumps the gun about security gains his administration has allegedly made so far. Nearly 8,500 people in Mexico were murdered in just the first three months of 2019, marking a nine percent increase from the same period last year and the most violent start to a year in the country's history, according to Animal Politico. As monolithic organized crime structures have dispersed and fragmentation has taken over Mexico's criminal landscape, territorial disputes over drug trafficking, extortion, oil theft and other illicit activities have shown no signs of abating. This is particularly true in Veracruz. The CJNG and Zetas Old School (Zetas Vieja Escuela) -- one of the strongest splinter factions of the once-feared Zetas cartel -- are at war in the Gulf state after members of the Zetas Old School allegedly executed three suspected CJNG members there earlier this month. To throw more fuel onto the fire, a splinter group linked to the Gulf Cartel and known as the Shadow Group (Grupo Sombra) recently left a dismembered corpse and a narco-banner to warn the CJNG and Zetas of what will happen if they enter territory already controlled by the group, not only in Veracruz, but also in Hidalgo, Tamaulipas and San Luis Potosi, according to La Opinion. But there may be a method to their madness. Such barbaric acts as the Veracruz massacre are effective, according to security analyst Alejandro Hope. On top of the low risk of being captured or convicted by authorities, such violence ""inhibits rivals, intimidates potential victims and helps preserve internal discipline,"" Hope wrote April 22 in a column for El Universal ."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"The Life and Death of a Mexican Hitman. It's 7 pm on a Sunday, and night is falling in this Michoacan town. The heat of the day is past, and there's a pleasant breeze. The first visitors to the park have left for dinner, but many hang around. Around the park's outer edges, teenagers stroll in two circular currents. The boys walk with their friends, in teams of two, three or four. The girls do the same, but in the opposite direction. So the circles intersect, inescapably, again and again. Boys and girls trade shy, longing glances. The lucky few get to hold hands or share a bench, words of affection and maybe a kiss. It's a teenage ritual, here and in countless municipal parks across Mexico. *This article was originally published by International Crisis Group. It was translated, edited for clarity and reprinted with permission, but does not necessarily reflect the views of InSight Crime. See the original version in English here. Not for Grillo, though. Not for The Cricket. He's eligible to participate, for he's hardly older than a teen, but he isn't here to flirt. Grillo is here to kill. Why? He can't express a reason beyond that he's been given a name and a face. Maybe he doesn't need to explain any further than that. Maybe he just needs to be able to take orders from the cerro , the hills overlooking Tierra Caliente, the Hot Land, as this Michoacan region is known. Up on the cerro , the crime lords decide life and death for the people below. Philosophy aside, Grillo kills because he's paid for it, half before, half after. It's a performance bonus to complement the base salary of a sicario , or hitman, which is close to nothing. The story I want to tell is Grillo's story, just as he told it to me. We met four times. We smoked together. We walked to where he'd killed. We sat late into the night. The Cricket - his real narco nickname - taught me a great deal about what Mexico needs to confront if it is to overcome a murder rate that rivals the casualty figures in many of the world's wars. He showed me what this miasma of conflict really feels like: the blurring of lines between state and organized crime, the dissolution of order, both the state's and the cartels', and the mutation of narco-traffickers into warlords. Child soldiers like him are recruited into a system whose roots are sunk deep in Mexico's inequalities. Then they are often trained to become ruthless killers, going from victims to victimizers. Grillo taught me about why, amid the cycles of revenge, it's so hard to get out. He died trying. It is young men like him who will test the moral limits of Mexican society, which is just beginning to debate whether every sicario deserves to die or some can be forgiven. Such cases will determine, in the end, whether big ideas like ""truth commissions"" and ""amnesties"" flourish or perish. ""You will have whatever you desire, if you go for it without doubting, if you put your mind to it, if you visualize it"". Grillo recites his version of the Law of Attraction, the power of positive thinking hammered into him in crude indoctrination camps up on the cerro , an almost mystical place symbolizing the capos ' power. With New Age self-help mantras, La Familia Michoacana, once the undisputed criminal powerhouse in Tierra Caliente, sought to fashion an army with a veneer of spirituality. The mantras are also a way of making crime bosses appear to be saviors. To many in Michoacan, anyone's promise of order is preferable to the chaos and corruption the government delivers. A Name and a Face On the Saturday before he goes to the park, Grillo is given a name and handed a photo showing a face, as usual. Then he spends the night in a safe house, a non-descript shanty on the outskirts of town, one in a warren of grey brick dwellings, unpainted and unfinished. Here, in the domain of the economically crushed, he's right at home. Inside, there's just a bare, stained mattress with no sheets. The next day, he putters around until early evening, staring at the no-paint, no-plaster walls, wasting time on Facebook, uploading a post honoring his santita , his little saint, a death dispenser's spiritual partner of choice. La Santa Muerte. The Holy Death. A Templar eats handmade tortillas for breakfast. Locals cater for the narco platoon stationed in their village, supplementing their income. Source: International Crisis Group. Then he's walking to the park, with a .38 tucked in the back of his pants. He's going to use it on the guy in the photo. He doesn't know who the marked man is, and he doesn't care. The guy will have done something to cross the capos. Probably, it's an unpaid debt or a refusal to submit to an extortionate demand that was first masked as a polite request. Even at this point in his career, when he's killed many times, Grillo still believes in the Family's values. He believes that when he's called up to the cerro and comes back down with a name, those who write down the names have good reasons. He believes that there's logic and necessity and justice behind every death - and that those who die have it coming. At least he tells himself that. It beats ending up on the capos ' list himself. Grillo's got the face's photo, but he needs confirmation. So he says the face's name, when he's just a few arm's lengths away. The man turns around, and that seals his fate. Grillo delivers the death sentence with two shots to the face - always two shots. He's got to be sure. The face goes down, and Grillo leans over it. It's part of what he does, his custom. He reenacts it for me later in the dimly lit, dusty track on the way up to his barrio , his neighbourhood in his birthplace of Apatzingan - a town known as La A in local narco-parlance - where we sit by the iron cross erected for another of his victims, struck down in exactly the same way. There's no life coming back to this one. Grillo walks away, a little faster than before, but not running. He's using the panic that has now enveloped the park to shroud his disappearance. He learned to keep his cool a long time ago. Tacos de Tripa He's gotten used to it, he says. He's accustomed to all of it except for the smell of blood, which he's never quite managed to ignore. He still feels sick when it's his turn to cut off some tied-up dude's ear. That needs doing, too; it's part of the job. But he's never liked the screams or the penetrating iron stench as the blood rushes out. That's not his style. He likes to kill quick, the honorable way, with two shots to the head. No carving up flesh, no drawing it out, none of that. Every profession has its pitfalls. But he's become like a rock. They've trained him to be one, or so he tells me as we sit in a back room of an office building as shabby as the safe house. It's the only neutral ground I could find at the time. There are just two bright-red plastic chairs to punctuate the neon-lit emptiness, the cheap white fan complicit in the 11 pm heat. The words bounce off the bare walls. I can see that he likes the unexpected attention, though he's still a bit bewildered at my outsider's interest in his life story. I try to dodge the triggers, possibly dangerous, that must booby-trap his memory. I don't know what state he's in. The people who introduced us describe him as an exceptional psychopath, whose killings have strangled all compassion within him. Gradually, my nervousness gives way to a feeling of banal familiarity. The way our worlds now overlap bewilders me, too. The oversized nightwatchman slams the iron front door, again and again. It's his way of making clear that he wishes the sicario wasn't here. I don't blame him. Grillo has a reputation in this part of town. And even if he didn't, most folks wouldn't want his type around. The crystal meth has gotten the better of him, his eyes beginning to retreat into his skull, his naturally dark skin fading to an ashen grey, paper-thin, precariously suspended over protruding cheekbones, threatening to rupture at any moment. We get along, even so. I buy him a Coke. He brings the stories. An evening's entertainment for local youngsters in Apatzingar, Michoacan Source: International Crisis Group His killing in the park accomplished, Grillo says, he crosses a nearby avenue, busy at this time of day. He follows the traffic for a bit, but he is still in sight of the murder scene when he pulls up a plastic stool at a taco stand. A single bulb dangling from a bare wire attached to the metal frame, its light reflecting off the plastic tarp, bathes the space in a shady reddishness. The taquero , the taco maker, wears an expression as serious as a spinal surgeon's as he pulls at the mass of intestines bubbling away in a deep metal bowl of fat. He chops them up with an instrument more machete than kitchen knife. Grillo orders cinco de tripa, five tripe tacos. He orders them with todo , so the vendor throws the cilantro-onion mixture on top. Grillo finishes the assembly off with spoonfuls of red-hot chili sauce, then squirts of lime. 150m or so away, the night air fills with the sirens of patrol cars and ambulances, their lights oscillating, red and blue. Grillo stuffs his face, pays up and, as good manners dictate, wishes provecho , or bon appetit, to the other patrons. They are observing the ruckus down the road, unaware that it's because of him. He walks over to a nearby 7-11 for dessert, a strawberry-flavoured yoghurt drink. It's the end of his shift. Cleaning up Society, One Murder at a Time Grillo works the kill list one by one. As the latest iteration of Mexico's drug war worsens, the bosses up on the cerro keep updating the list. It's just the bad guys, they say, necessary sacrifices to the gods of order and social peace. But then again, it's also those who haven't paid up. Examples have to be made. And then they add more names, more and more, for this or that transgression or perceived instance of disrespect. It can be as little as a word out of context, or out of order, that reaches the wrong ears. Or if you don't make your way up the hill when they send for you. Cuando te mandan llamar, vas o vas. When you're called on to come, you can either go, or you can go. It's common knowledge. Way back when, a younger Grillo got in trouble before he'd escaped across the line to El Norte, the U.S. But the gringos didn't appreciate someone running with gangs and sent him back. He picks up the story again: he's still a fresh-faced nineteen-year-old when the Family snatches him up. They know of his earlier days of knife-wielding robberies, and give him a choice: run with us or become the next item on our list. The Cricket starts out with the Family when business is booming. The Family is riding high on its values, and everybody has to know about it. The bodies are billboards for the Family's claim to absolute power. It works. The message spreads. People are scared witless, locally, nationally and abroad. Academics tell their students they would get killed if they so much as set foot in Tierra Caliente. The international media are fascinated: a narco-sect going at it like Charles Manson. It's how the Family establishes a brand name, unlike anything Mexican narco-surrealism has churned out before or since. But in Apatzingan, in Michoacan, there are sighs of relief, too. Finally, ordinary folks can leave their doors open again. The Family isn't stupid. Neither is Grillo. He joins them, and he makes a living killing in the name of Family values. He believes in them, too, maybe for lack of an actual family of his own. Somewhere in the city, there's a grandmother barely able to stand the sight of him. She knows well enough the depths he's sunk to. There's an aunt somewhere, too, but she's killed in front of her place. Two shots, point blank - his style, pretty much. She hasn't paid up, either. In the faceless cases, death provokes from Grillo nothing more than a shrug. But this time, he rushes to the scene to find the body still lying there. And so, the Family becomes family, for a while at least, a substitute for belonging. It's enough belonging for him to get the numerical code signifying La Familia Michoacana tattooed on his right forearm. They see something in him, Grillo says proudly. He isn't just a regular assassin, but one who will rise through the ranks to become middle management, with luck even a patron. They get to him with the promise of power, glory and the good life. The reality is otherwise, he continues. He and the other muchachos sleep among the rocks. It rains until their bones are wet, the scorpions come out and they all come down with Chikungunya or Zika or whatever's current, virologically, in Tierra Caliente. And they get paid, as rookies, 350 bucks a month. They can't even spend it on booze and female company, since the commanders don't respect weekends, when they could show off what little they've made. In fact, it's a minor miracle that these muchachos , these wafer-thin boys who look like silhouettes in their skinny jeans, can make war with heavy made-in-Yugoslavia Kalashnikovs rather than, say, simply collapse and call it a day. A member of the Fuerza Rural guards a checkpoint deep in cartel territory Source: International Crisis Group But Grillo hasn't realized any of that yet. He excels. ""El Dragon told the boss: 'most of them aren't any good. It's clear that the only chingon is Grillo"". The only real badass. The Dragon isn't just anybody. He's a former elite soldier, brought up from Guatemala, where he and his brothers-in-arms, the bastard kids of U.S. counter-insurgency operations, slaughtered indigenous villagers and anyone else thought to be susceptible to communism. Then came peace accords, demobilization, and unemployment. The Dragon has skills not being put to use. It's a shameful inefficiency. The market doesn't let them go to waste. The Family sends envoys south, bringing back whomever they can find, free agents, hunters, jungle trackers, mountain stalkers, village burners or throat slashers. The Family brings them to do their thing in Michoacan - but mostly to teach Grillo and the others to be a bit like them. The Dragon becomes Grillo's father in this new Family of his. ""He had faith in me"". He teaches The Cricket a caminar, how to walk, and the right way to use those juguetes , those special toys. ""He pulled me in. He taught me strategic movements, close combat. I became professional with weapons. They trained me as a sniper, in handling grenades, explosives"". He makes it to be a full-bore pistolero , a gunman, at just nineteen. ""I loved it, getting to know it all, how we were advancing. And the way we had so much influence in the barrios "". He moves up in the organization to lead cells of fifteen fighters in confrontations with rival criminals and state forces. An elite sicario in the making, he gets to guard high-level Family capo s and to work on the kill list for extra pay. Death is in demand. Life is golden, until it isn't. Saint Nazario and The Monkey Affairs in the Family go sour, with a nasty divorce splitting it in half. The smaller half remains loyal to El Chango, The Monkey. He is one of the apas , the Dads, the Family's original brand label. Then the chubby-cheeked co-founder is betrayed. Or so his madrina , his godmother, tells me when I track her down. She's struggling to keep tears from flowing, and doesn't touch the Nescafe in front of her. Her voice, almost inaudible even at normal times, is drowned out by the pickup trucks driving by underneath the balcony where we sit. She doesn't blame the other apa - The Craziest One, the self-declared Saint Nazario - as much as she does the man who sometimes goes by the name of El Profe, The Teacher. (Later, I meet him, too. He is also known as La Tuta, which has no meaning. He just says: ""Call me what you like"".) It was, after all, The Teacher who chose the side of The Saint, tilting the power balance and chasing The Monkey off his throne. President Felipe Calderon's first round of operations to clean out the michoacanos fails, spectacularly. Now it's 2010, and he's making a last desperate attempt. US-supplied Black Hawks hover over organized crime's heartland south of the river, its last line of defense. The Family's forces take major losses. While the state scorches Tierra Caliente, and while The Saint is up against the wall, The Monkey makes a grab for the empire. To many, it's treason, plain and simple, of the kind that would rip any family to shreds. The Monkey's madrina , of course, says it's all a pretext, a disguised power play by The Saint. It's plain and simple geopolitics: a battle for control of resources, human, natural and otherwise, by any means necessary. That may be the bird's eye view. Down in the dirt, it's sons against sons, linea against linea , lineage of loyalty against splintered lineage. Grillo joins the The Saint, Nazario, who has rebranded his linea the Knights Templar - no relation to the Crusaders, of course. He does this before he can even consider getting rid of the La Familia tattoo on his forearm, which had only been there for a few months. A week before, The Saint's muchachos are echando copas, tossing back a few, and maybe getting in a fight with one of The Monkey's guys who was cheating at poker. But nothing more. They'd still come out as brothers. Now they're trying to blow the other guys' brains out, staging a night raid on a mountain safe house. Their former brothers don't see it coming, and they're asleep when the attack starts. The Cricket and his crew kill fourteen of The Monkey's men. Grillo doesn't know them. They're faceless still as he watches a pyre of wood, fuelled by gasoline, consume their bodies. He and his fellow gunmen camp out that night, close to the site of the carnage. They eat handmade tortillas, with scrambled eggs and green chili, and joke it all away. ""With that much death around you, you don't feel anything anymore. If I did, it would make me weak"". Then he sees twenty of his new Templar brothers get killed in a four-hour mountain battle for territory. Their bodies, too, are burned and dumped in a river, not by their brothers-become-enemies, but by their own commander. ""They didn't even get a funeral. We weren't worth anything. We were fighting without recognition, for a cause that nobody understood"". And The Cricket keeps telling me what he was thinking: ""Hey. All that shit about the good life, about a family, about us mattering, fighting for a cause? Where's that now? Before we were fighting for something. Afterward, it was only because The Monkey, The Saint or The Teacher wanted to fuck each other up. But we were the ones providing the dead"". The up-and-coming sicario is about to come crashing down. A Rocky Refuge Grillo makes a run for it, back to La A. His death is now demanded. It can't be any other way. The automatic penalty for desertion is capital punishment. He knows that. He's even sworn a blood oath on it. But he rules out running farther away. ""This is my land. My grandparents and uncles are buried here. This is where I will die"". Rocks become Grillo's refuge. He sleeps among them, way up on the highest point of his barrio , a neighborhood looking down on the lights in the valley below. He thinks it will keep him safe, that the view will give him time to react, that the neighbors in the street below will give him a heads-up if a stranger appears. The runaway sicario counts on solidarity. ""They are my people"". But nobody's coming yet. The death sentence has been suspended. Below, the capos ' angry divorce has mutated into a full-throttle civil war. And while Grillo might be in a tough corner, the Templars are getting their heads smashed in. Those, that is, who aren't joining the autodefensa s, vigilante groups claiming to fight the good fight to end cartel tyranny, pulling on the white shirts that signal innocence, reform and a flimsy promise of state protection. Bloody intra-family butchery being what it is, for the time being nobody has the time to worry about treasonous small fry like him. Strange alliances are forged in the strife. Autodefensas , former Templars now wearing the new white autodefensa s shirts, olive-shirted guachos , the soldiers, and blue-shirted federales , the police, are all combing Tierra Caliente for Templars still on active duty. Bullets are flying everywhere. All the gunfights fill the valley air with dust so thick that it almost conceals Grillo and his treason. Almost. For Grillo, there's no escaping the vortex. The guachos pick him up. A local newspaper garnishes its piece on the arrest with a full-color photograph of his misery, handcuffed, huddled on a sidewalk, his face turned from the camera, given up by ""his people"". He's just another Templar off the streets, another Templar up for grabs. The guachos have no use for him. But someone else sure does: the Viagras. The Viagras' branding captures the essence of their business model. Puro adelante, always on the move , they go from being Zeta matones, or enforcers, to Family matones to Templar matones. It's quite the career, and it hints at an aspiration to one day become la mera verga, the biggest stick around. Conditions are ideal. The government has already failed twice to defeat the michoacanos with frontal assaults, spilling rivers of police blood. With the world's eye focused on the hot hinterlands once again, they need something else. The new strategy: ""If you can't beat them, break them up into inobtrusive pieces"". That, they hope, might make that public relations problem go away. In this narco-world turned upside down, it turns out that everybody, including the federal government, needs the puros adelantes. The Viagras are just the guys to get it done: they've got the guns, the vehicles, the intelligence, and the operational support. And so the federales get Templars to kill Templars, to weaken each other, without bearing much of the cost. And the government has less media trouble, because it's good against evil, and for once the federales are (sort of) on the right side. Playing his small part, Grillo finds himself tied up in the back of a military transporter, being taken to what he assumes will be a base, a jail or some other state facility. But when the doors open up and his eyes adjust to the bright light, he's staring at a not-too-official-looking patio filled with a handful of not-too-official-looking men with guns. They lead him into a back room. The room has grey, featureless walls, with no paint and no plaster. Only this time, he's on the receiving end. He gets tied to a chair and left alone for a bit in the twilight. He knows what's coming. The beating starts, two men circling him, spitting words and saliva. Then they bring out the cigarettes and the cable. It lasts for hours. None of it's even necessary at this point. Grillo's ready to give it all up, the loyalty beaten out of him for good. It's been gone ever since they slew El Dragon, another consequence of the paranoia that reigns over narco life and death, but to him, an unforgivable sin. Ever since they dumped those bodies into the river. Ever since he realized the cause was nothing but a self-serving hoax. So he agrees. From there on out, it's easy going, by his standards. A snake of pick-up trucks winds its way through the cerro in the hunt for The Teacher, the last apa still standing. Grillo is shot at a couple of times. But he has sufficient leisure to pose for photos - he still keeps them on his cellphone - with old buddies carrying new guns and wearing new shirts in navy blue, the color of the Fuerza Rural, the Rural Force, conjured by someone to suggest the return of state rule. A Useful Psychopath I meet Grillo in the twilight of his career. Because of what he's done, his life is hanging by a thread. I spot and worry an AK-47 bullet out of the wall, a mark of yearned-for revenge. Everybody knows. But he does, too. The scars across his back say so, medium-rare lines, two dozen of them visible still. The electric cable cut through his skin, into his flesh. Right into La Santa Muerte. They were pounding on him for hours and burning holes into him with cigarettes. Su Santita can still protect him. But only so much, and only for a while longer. El Grillo, prior to reenacting how he killed his victim on that very spot Source: International Crisis Group He resumes his tale once more: when the Fuerza Royal is done with him, they throw him back into the water. He gets picked up again by the autodefensas of La A, in part of the state's experiment in getting a grip on the general disorder. ""Anywhere else in the world, psychopaths are a problem. But here, they're an asset"", an adviser to the group tells me. Grillo is valuable to them - a psychopath perhaps, but a useful one. They keep him on a tight leash, unarmed and under control. He gives them the basic map of the Templar universe, and gets to live in exchange. That's the deal, and the only protection he's got. For the time being, La A's autodefensa council lends precarious cohesion to the plethora of actors carving out roles for themselves in the post-Templar Tierra Caliente. But internal feuds are tearing away at the consensus. The debate is centered on permissible ways of financing, driven by an acute economic crisis, a shortage of funds for fuel and wages. ""All of them are still narcos at heart"", says the adviser. Grillo concurs. But within that spectrum a culture war is going down: trabajar contra robar, working vs. stealing. There is no reason, the puros adelantes argue, to vacate a field already being filled, inevitably, by other actors, such as agents of the federal state attorney's office. There comes a day, in the council, when guns replace words. Placed on the table, the guns announce the return of what came before, of mas de lo mismo, more of the same. It's the end of dialogue, the end of the structure. There's a new reshuffling of the armed landscape, everything up for grabs again. Low-intensity narco-warfare has been interrupted for the blink of an eye only to roar back with a vengeance. It brings a new kill list, a fresh cycle of death, still spinning as I write - and the end of Grillo's protection. He retreats to the rocks above La A. He invites me to tag along, leading the way, past the iron cross, up to his last refuge. We chat for a while longer. Then smoke rises from the light bulb he uses as a makeshift meth pipe, his back turned toward me, the spectator. His mind fades into nothingness, but I linger, making my can of beer last. I puncture the silence with questions, hoping to elicit conversation, a few extra details at least. But it feels strange now, with me clear-headed and him gone. Intervals drag on eternally. I say I need to go, and I get a strange look. Taxis - as I should've known - avoid the area, especially at 3am. One reason is Grillo's buddies, whom we bump into as I push us down to where the pavement begins. They used to do what he used to do, Grillo tells me, but they have gone freelance now. Their motorcycles are the new emblem of insecurity in La A. It is the moto-sicarios who take me out. Grillo stays behind. ""This is my land. My grandparents and uncles are buried here. This is where I will die"". He does die, six months later, struck down on a street corner, all light brown dust but for the dark red blood pooling under his head. It's one shot, a clean kill. He would have approved. There's no carving up, no drawing it out. He's killed the honorable way. I read the news in a Mexican paper at my desk, incomprehensibly far away, gazing at English rain. The tabloid dedicates a photo to The Cricket - a photo and eight lines of text. But there's whiskey at a convenience store. I take that walk. *This article was originally published by International Crisis Group.

"Counting Mexicos Hitmen. Estimates of the number of gunmen employed by Mexico 's cartels are highly inflated, argues blogger Alejandro Hope, who tries to come up with a better figure. In Mexico, we know how many people die, but not how many people kill. We know even less in regards to how many of these killers are on the payroll of a criminal organization. There are estimates of the number of gunmen and thugs in the service of drug cartels, but like everything in this business, they tend strongly towards hyperbole. For example, in a meeting with federal representatives in 2008, General Guillermo Galvan, the defense minister, stated that 500,000 Mexicans were linked to drug trafficking , of which 40,000 ""occupied various leadership positions."" I don't know what he meant by leadership, but we can assume General Galvan included all armed members of cartels in that figure, since they do not fall into any of the other categories he listed (producers, retail dealers, transporters, distributors and informants). In 2009, Republican Senator John Cornyn , of the progressive state of Texas, asserted that the Sinaloa and Gulf (not yet separated from the Zetas ) Cartels could mobilize 100,000 foot soldiers, a force almost as big as the Mexican Army, according to the distinguished legislator. The figure came, apparently, from ""sources in the Defense Ministry."" Is there any way to verify such claims? Not directly. For very obvious reasons, criminal organizations tend not to register their employees with the IMSS [Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - Mexico's national public health service]. However, by using the number of killings allegedly linked to organized crime as our base, we can try to make an estimate of the number of cartel assassins. According to the president of the Republic, last year there were 15,273 "" deaths attributed to criminal rivalry "" (don't you love this highly Mexican example of newspeak?). We subtract from this total the 1,800 dead in confrontations with Mexico's security forces, which leaves us with 13,473 victims of assassinations and attacks. Although we suspect that many of these deaths resulted from incidents of multiple homicides, we cannot know exactly how many because this data has not been made public. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the number of incidents will be fewer than the number of victims. Let's take the conservative figure of 1.5 victims per incident. This gives us a total of 8,982 incidents. We can assume that this number increased by approximately 20 percent this year (given the recent homicide statistics reported by the National Public Security System , this appears to be a reasonable rate). Therefore, we would end the year with 10,778 incidents. It is a reasonable assumption that the majority of homicides linked to organized crime are not committed by lone assassins. In most cases, it is likely that a group of killers is involved. Supposing that each group/cell has, on average, between five and 10 members and that each group/cell is responsible for only one incident per month (they just scratch their bellies the rest of the time). Consequently, we could generously estimate that approximately 900 assassination cells exist, claiming somewhere between 4,500 and 9,000 members, at the most. And the story does not end there. On the one hand, it is likely that some of these thugs are not permanently on the payroll, but rather, are contracted to carry out specific murders (there is fairly clear evidence of this practice in Ciudad Juarez , for example). On the other hand, the participation in assassinations by these individuals probably does not have a normal distribution. Moreover, I would assume that the distribution follows the Pareto principle: the most violent 20 percent are responsible for 80 percent of homicides. At the end of the day, we have learned of gunmen responsible for hundreds of killings. This would imply that between 900 and 1,800 individuals are responsible for nearly 13,000 homicides a year. Consequently, if there were 4,500 to 9,000 thugs in the service of the cartels, they would have the spare capacity to handle various functions; not just killing people, but protecting leadership and drug shipments, kidnapping migrants or running extortion rackets. Is this calculation consistent with estimates of General Galvan or Senator Cornyn? Put simply, it is totally incompatible. Why would criminal organizations have tens of thousands of men on the payroll doing literally nothing? Unless you think, of course, that the cartels are philanthropic organizations. When President Calderon spoke of a "" ridiculous minority ,"" he probably did not know how truly ridiculous that minority was. A high proportion of the homicidal violence Mexico is the responsibility, at any given time, of a few hundred people. It is worth noting that this is not always the same group: the disadvantage of being an assassin is that it is a position with high turnover. If the figures on confrontations are correct (1,800 deaths in 2010), a hitman has, at a minimum, between 20 to 40 percent chance of dying in one year. This implies that virtually none have survived more than three to five years. I only hope they know this -- if they do not know, we would do well to tell them.

"Dominican President Asks for More US Anti-Drug Aid. The president of the Dominican Republic called on the U.S. to increase anti-drug trafficking aid to the island nation, which is in need of more technical equipment to better monitor its air and maritime territory. Speaking at an international security forum, President Leonel Fernandez said that the Dominican Republic needs radar, go-fast boats and other equipment to step up the fight against organized crime, reports national newspaper Diario Libre. Since the government purchased eight Super Tucano aircrafts from Brazil in 2009, there has been ""no trace"" of drug planes in the Dominican Republic's airspace, he said. However, as noted by the 2011 State Department Report on narcotics control, the island remains a major transit country for drug traffickers transfering their wares by sea. The loosely controlled border with Haiti also sees significant drug flow. The Dominican Republic's 14,000 member police force is not enough to properly monitor its territory, Fernandez said. The Dominican Republic is slated to receive $5.6 million in anti-drug aid from the U.S. for the 2012 fiscal year. The Caribbean region as a whole will receive $96.8 million in anti-drug aid for 2012, compared to the $300 million in funds promised to Central America. In May, Dominican authorities said they would begin tightening control on fuel sales in order to continue reducing the number of illegal aircrafts that attempt to refuel on the island. But the country faces other hurdles in the fight against drug trafficking which have little to do with technical equipment, Fernandez admitted during the security forum. Cases related to organized crime in the Caribbean see a 90 percent impunity rate, he said. Corruption in the Dominican security forces has been another significant problem, with more than 5,000 members of the police and army reportedly fired over the last three years for their alleged links to crime.

Rio Police Most Corrupt in Brazil: Govt Survey. Police in the state of Rio de Janeiro are the most corrupt in Brazil, according to a government study into police extortion, underscoring the urgent need for police reform as part of the state's security policies. According to the National Victimization Survey carried out by the Ministry of Justice, 7.2 percent of those surveyed in Rio said they had been forced to pay bribes to police officials, far above the national average of 2.6 percent. Some 30.2 percent of Brazilians who reported having been extorted by military police, and 17.2 percent of those who said they had been extorted by civil police, were from Rio de Janeiro. In the state of Sao Paulo the percentage of people saying they had paid police bribes was below the national average, at 1.8 percent. The state accounted for the second highest number of people reporting military police extortion, at 18.2 percent, and the highest percentage of civil police extortion victims, at 28.6 percent. Police corruption is a serious problem throughout Brazil, where over 60 percent of the population distrusts the police. Rio police are among the worst offenders, with some current and former members working in vigilante militia groups linked to extortion and contract killing. In December 2012 alone, some 59 Rio military police were arrested over an alleged drug ring, while five active police officers were accused of running an extortion ring. Recent arrests, as well as a 2011 anti-corruption operation leading to the arrest of 30 officers , suggest that there is a will on the part of the Rio government to clean up the police force, through the survey underlines the extent of the corruption.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0
"Paraguays EPP Guerrillas Linked to Church. According to a Paraguayan bishop, some members of the country's EPP guerrilla army were involved in Catholic Church-sponsored programs, and may have had remote ties to President Fernando Lugo, himself a former priest. In an interview with Paraguayan newspaper ABC, Bishop Emeritus Oscar Paez acknowledged that ""those who today are in the Peasant Organization of the North [a smaller rebel group] and even in the EPP were people trained by the Church."" The Paraguayan People's Army (Ejercito del Pueblo Paraguayo - EPP) is a small leftist guerrilla group, thought to have fewer than 100 members. It became active under its current name in the last decade. The bishop took care to distance the church from the rebels' criminal actions, such as kidnapping and murder. As the Associated Press reports, Paez's statements coincide with those made by another church official, San Pedro Bishop Adalberto Martinez. According to Martinez, the church ran a social education seminar in the EPP's main area of operations in the rural north in the 1990s which was committed to the ""reality of the people."" He said that the effort was an initiative by then bishop and current President Fernando Lugo, and asserted that ""several participants in the seminar, according to news reports, seem to be part of the EPP."" The AP claims that this includes Manuel Cristaldo, the EPP's second in command, who according to intelligence reports served as a deacon for Lugo and assisted him in several masses. Still, as InSight Crime has reported, President Lugo has made combating the EPP a hallmark of his presidency , perhaps in part to undermine allegations about his links with the extreme left. It is unlikely that his 52.1 percent approval rating will be significantly affected by these allegations. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Venezuela Presidential Candidates Promise Action on Security. Venezuela's interim president and socialist party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro has blamed the country's crime and violence problems on capitalism, and his rival Henrique Capriles led a march calling for improved security, as the country's security issues increasingly come to the fore in the presidential campaign. United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) candidate Maduro echoed his predecessor, the recently deceased Hugo Chavez , in blaming the country's endemic violence on the ""legacy of capitalism,"" and pledged to create a Venezuela, ""without violence, without crime,"" if elected April 14. Maduro also stated that a new disarmament plan will soon be approved, and that various armed groups have responded to calls by his government to lay down their weapons, reported Pagina 12. Meanwhile, opposition leader Capriles led a political march in Caracas and 17 Venezuelan states, demanding security and an end to violence. On April 1, Interior and Justice Minister Nestor Reverol announced that 3,400 homicides have occurred in Venezuela since January 1, with 545 occurring in Miranda state, where Capriles is currently governor. The fact that both candidates are openly discussing Venezuela's security problems marks a significant change in the country's political discourse. While the homicide rate has dramatically risen since Chavez came to power in 1998, the problem was rarely directly addressed by the Chavez administration. In the past, even Chavez's opponents have been reluctant to make it a primary focus. For his part, Chavez was so agile politically, that he could sidestep or blame it on someone else. Maduro, who is expected to win the upcoming elections handily, does not have the same agility or charisma as his predecessor, and he may find that blaming capitalism will be a short-term solution."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Op-Ed: Venezuela, The Ongoing Hurricane in the Caribbean. While Colombia bears the brunt of the Venezuelan exodus in terms of sheer numbers, several islands of the Caribbean, like Trinidad and Tobago, are being battered by a criminal hurricane unleashed by the nation's collapse. Colombia has anything up to one and a half million Venezuelans now living in country or passing through to other parts of the region, a staggering three percent of the population. Trinidad and Tobago however, with a population of almost 1.4 million has up to 100,000 Venezuelans, a figure of over seven percent. Such is the influx, that the English speaking island is being forced to rediscover its Spanish roots and the fast paced Venezuelan Spanish can increasingly be heard on street corners amid the Caribbean creole. *This article was originally published by Semana and was reprinted by InSight Crime with permission. See the original in Spanish here. Trinidad and Tobago, unlike Colombia, does not have a well-oiled machine to receive and process Venezuelan migrants, nor does it easily grant them recognition, allowing them to work and get access to health care and education. This forces many into the underworld, into taking menial jobs, or if they are attractive young women, into prostitution. While in Port of Spain I spoke to a young woman who had been trafficked from Venezuela, and promised, in return for $1500, the chance to work in a restaurant and thus send back desperately needed hard currency to her family in Valencia. Instead she was put to work in a bar and pressured into prostitution. When she refused she was savagely beaten. Now she sits, terrified, in a tiny room she rents, with no job and not even enough money to make the journey back to Venezuela. Her story is not uncommon, and the prostitution sector on the island is booming. Venezuelans are also feeding the street gangs, which in turn feed Trinidad and Tobago's murder rate of 37.5 per 100,000 people, far head of Colombia's 25 killings per 100,000. Just 11 kilometers from the coast of Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago provides much of the contraband for eastern Venezuela. While migrants and cocaine leave Venezuelan shores in growing quantities, food and medicines travel the other way, for purchase by those in Venezuela who still have access to hard currency. There has been explosive growth in pharmacies and mini markets across the islands of Trinidad and Tobago and it is common knowledge that the real money is not made with goods sold across the counter, but the boxes that leave through the back door and find their way onto boats streaking across the Caribbean towards Venezuela. Piracy across the straits is common, and Trinidad's newspaper frequently report on the kidnapping of fishermen. But let's return to the cocaine mentioned above. Organized crime is like water. It follows the path of least resistance. One of those paths now lies through Venezuela and onto the Caribbean. Catatumbo, which sits on the Venezuelan border, has become one of the focal points of cocaine production. This is the cheapest place in the world to produce cocaine. The growing conditions are perfect, with each hectare here able to produce more than seven kilos of cocaine. The ""raspachines"" who strip the leaves from the hardy coca bushes, are increasingly Venezuelan, and prepared to work for the price of a hot meal. The principal precursor in the production of coca base is petrol, almost free in Venezuela and easy to find in Norte de Santander. And the departure point for the cocaine to international markets is the Venezuelan coast, an easy journey facilitated by corrupt members of the Venezuela security forces who will wave through drug shipments for laughably small bribes. So now go-fast boats leave the Venezuelan coast in groups of up to seven, each carrying a ton of cocaine. Every week. Conservative estimates put the quantities of cocaine passing through Venezuela at 300 tons a year. International law enforcement agents believe the number is much closer to 500 tons. This is the fuel for the endless hurricane that batters the Caribbean with violence and corruption. The principal destination is the Dominican Republic with its big container ports and up to five million tourists passing through every year. But so many other islands offer possibilities to the drug traffickers. Puerto Rico is a US territory. Get onto the island and you are as good as on the US mainland. San Martin is French, while Sint Maarten is Dutch. Step onto this island and you are in Europe. Every day that the Venezuela collapse continues, is another day this criminal hurricane blows through the Caribbean, fed by cocaine and desperate Venezuelans fleeing their country. There were no contingency plans for this unnatural disaster, no idea that it could last so long. *This article was originally published by Semana and was reprinted by InSight Crime with permission.

"Factions of Sinaloa Cartel Battle in Durango. Two factions associated with the Sinaloa Cartel have turned their guns on each other in Durango, raising questions about the cohesiveness of Mexico's largest criminal organization, and whether the divide goes all the way to the top. In a ""narcomanta,"" or banner, displayed in Durango in mid-March, Los*M and Gente Nueva , which are respectively linked with Sinaloa bosses Ismael Zambada Garcia and Joaquin Guzman Loera , accused traffickers Felipe Cabrera and Noel Salgeiro of ""heating up the plaza"" of Durango, the state's capital city. The expression typically refers to an attempt by a gang to take over a town under rival control, through targeting competitors, attacks on government facilities, riots in local jails, and other violent tactics. The mantas gave the groups associated with Cabrera and Salgeiro 24 hours to leave the area. That was followed by a pair of videos uploaded online in March, showing men dressed in military garb interrogating hit men allegedly working for Salgeiro. In one of the videos, two triggermen said that they had been in Durango just a month, after being sent with orders to heat up the plaza. The dispute seems to indicate an internal split within Gente Nueva. Salgeiro and Cabrera are leaders of Gente Nueva, though their base of operations has typically been Parral, Chihuahua, a state that neighbors Durango. Yet Gente Nueva was alongside Los M at the bottom of the narcomanta, indicating some ownership of the message. Under this theory, Cabrera and Salgeiro represent a minority wing of Gente Nueva that has lost support among of the higher-ups in Sinaloa. Gente Nueva started as a band of gunmen working for Guzman, alias ""El Chapo,"" and has since earned notoriety for its role in the ongoing violence in Juarez. Guzman's gang has been pitted against the La Linea in Juarez, which occupies a similar role for the Juarez Cartel of Vicente Carrillo Fuentes , in addition to other local groups. Violence in Juarez has left more than 600 people dead so far this year, after 2010 in which more than 3,000 people were murdered. The strife within Gente Nueva has also led to speculation about the relationship between Zambada and Chapo Guzman. The two men are, along with Juan Jose Esparragoza , alias ""El Azul,"" the pillars of the Sinaloa Cartel. No credible reports of bad blood between them have emerged. But in the drug trade, of course, friendship is often temporary, and virtually always comes second to business. With billions of dollars at stake, a rupture between the two is far from impossible. While the Sinaloa Cartel is often portrayed as the most stable of the major organizations in Mexico, it has not been exempt from internal strife. In 2008, bad blood between Guzman and erstwhile ally and fellow Badiraguato, Sinaloa native Arturo Beltran Leyva , led to a major split in the gang, and a reordering of the nation's drug trade, as each party sought new alliances. The fallout killed Guzman's son in 2008. Beltran Leyva ultimately shifted his operations south to Cuernavaca, where he was killed by Mexican marines in 2009. Durango is attractive both as a pathway and as a producer state. Along with Chihuahua and Sinaloa, it forms part of the largely lawless Golden Triangle, a mountainous region notorious for poppy and marijuana cultivation. Durango is also an easy drive from Juarez and Nuevo Laredo, two of the largest border crossings, which makes it strategically advantageous for anyone seeking to send drugs into the U.S. Because of its appeal to organized crime, Durango is commonly counted among the most violence-ridden states in Mexico. The state was in the news last week when a mass grave containing 37 bodies was discovered near the state capital. Rumors that Chapo is living in Durango have been circulating for years. Most famously, in 2009, the state's archbishop accused authorities of ignoring his existence on a ranch in the area. More recently, the DEA told press in mid-April that Guzman was in Durango.

"Obama: Impossible to Stop Gun Trafficking South. U.S. President Barack Obama said his administration has no plans to implement new controls on arms sales, despite acknowledging the severity of the problem of illegal arms trafficking and the difficulty in slowing that traffic south, a Mexican news outlet reported. ""It is impossible to stop all arms traffic from north to south,"" Obama was quoted by El Informador online as saying in a press conference reportedly given to electronic media. Obama added that his strategy to curb the illegal trafficking of arms from the U.S. into Mexico is to focus on more stringent enforcement of existing laws. Obama admitted that much improvement can be made on this front, following the so-called ""Fast and Furious"" scandal , the report said. Under Operation Fast and Furious, carried out by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), U.S. officials allowed the sale of firearms to illegal purchasers in an attempt to trace gun-smuggling routes by Mexican gangs to the source buyer. However, around 1,700 weapons went missing during the nearly two-year investigation. During that time period, close to 20,000 Mexican citizens died in organized crime-related activity, and one U.S. border patrol agent was killed in an incident where authorities found a weapon that the ATF let ""walk,"" according to subsequent investigations. Obama was speaking just one day after U.S. attorney general Eric Holder told a Senate hearing that that the U.S. is ""losing the battle"" to stem the flow of weapons into Mexico. In a reference to Operation Fast and Furious, Holder described as ""flawed"" past U.S. attempts to tackle the problem and he told Senate that Congress should bear some responsibility for the problem due to its hostility towards gun control.

"Urabenos and Oficina De Envigado in Medellin Ceasefire. Colombia's most powerful criminal network the Urabenos may have entered into a pact with rivals Oficina de Envigado in Medellin, where the battle for control of the city has costs thousands of lives. According to Medellin-based NGO Corporation for Peace and Social Development (Corpades), the two gangs have agreed a ceasefire as part of the preliminary stages of a truce, reported El Colombiano. If by December the ceasefire has seen results then the aim is to massively extend the agreement into a wide-ranging truce, which would include provisions for an end to child recruitment, forced displacement , extortion in lower income neighborhoods and a host of other crimes that are part and parcel of life in Colombia's second city. Corpades President Fernando Quijano, an expert on Medellin's conflict, outlined an ambitious proposal for the eventual pact in which the two gangs would ultimately stop selling drugs to children, stop collaborating with members of state institutions and erase invisible borders in a ""gradual diminution of territorial, social, economic and military control by the two structures and their more than 350 groups which operate in the metropolitan area."" The proposal also includes plans for the withdrawal of the military from conflict-heavy neighborhoods and and their replacement with a community police force. The aim was not to end the city's conflict, said Quijano, but to turn it ""from a violent one into a social one."" If the first phase was successful a ""period of discussion and negotiation on all topics"" would begin in January next year. Medellin Security Secretary Arnulfo Serna told El Colombiano : ""It is clear a pact has been agreed between some criminal structures. However murders continue."" Medellin has been the center of Colombia's underworld for years, with domestic microtrafficking, extortion and lucrative drug trafficking routes out of the city earning gangs tens of millions of dollars a year. The city has been controlled by the Oficina de Envigado since the death of Pablo Escobar, but in recent years the group has splintered while the powerful Urabenos have been muscling in , contracting street gangs to fight a proxy war against their rivals. Currently, the Oficina retains control of more territory in the city, according to Corpades' mapping of the city's conflict zones, but the Urabenos have been making steady progress seizing strategically important zones from their sorely weakened opponents. At this stage it remains unclear exactly what each group hopes to achieve through a ceasefire, or if it could lead to permenant shifts in Medellin's criminal dynamic. However it seems unlikely the powerful interests that profit from the city's underworld will be prepared to walk away from the lucrative criminal opportunities on offer. Note: Fernando Quijano contacted InSight Crime to note that he does not refer to the Oficina de Envigado but the Oficina de Valle de Aburra (the region where Medellin is located) as a more accurate reflection of the group's structure and areas of influence. However, InSight has continued to use the term Oficina de Envigado as the more commonly used and easily recognized label applied to this criminal structure. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Report Highlights Need for Independent Anti-Graft Body in Honduras. A new report says that an anti-graft body in Honduras has secured prosecutions in only a small fraction of the cases it has investigated in recent years, illustrating the weakness of Honduran institutions when it comes to anti-corruption measures. Honduras' National Anti-Corruption Council (Consejo Nacional Anticorrupcion - CNA) initiated a total of 67 investigations into corruption between 2014 and 2017 but secured prosecutions in just 10 of them, according to a February 22 report from the organization. The CNA was created by a 2005 law with the stated objective of supporting the government's anti-corruption efforts. Representatives from 12 groups, some of which include members of the country's economic elite, run the CNA. Among other things in the report, the CNA presented eight specific investigations into public contracts given to private businesses in Honduras in 2017 alone, which cost the state over 195 million lempiras (more than $8 million) in losses. One of the cases highlighted in the report is the alleged diversion of 12 million lempiras (more than $500,000) of public funds into a personal account of former first lady Rosa Elena Bonilla de Lobo, the wife of former Honduran President Porfirio Lobo. According to the report, Bonilla de Lobo transferred 12 million lempiras in public funds to a personal account just days before the end of her husband's term as president. Former President Lobo has been accused of corruption and accepting bribes from the powerful Cachiros drug trafficking network in Honduras. While Lobo has denied these allegations, the country's internationally-backed Support Mission Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (Mision de Apoyo contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad en Honduras - MACCIH) is reportedly closing in on the former president's alleged criminal activities. In total, the CNA report found that corruption networks in Honduras cost the state 2.9 billion lempiras (nearly $125 million) in losses between 2014 and 2017. The recent report provides further evidence that domestic institutions in Honduras lack the ability to effectively combat corruption, underscoring the importance of independent bodies like the MACCIH in tackling graft in the Central American nation. Although the CNA's role is ostensibly to root out corruption in Honduras, its own report shows that it has had little impact. As freelance journalist Sandra Cuffe explained on Twitter , this is likely because the institution itself is beholden to elite interests that could be involved in corruption. ""The CNA is so full of powerful business and political interests that it's almost hard to think of an institution worse positioned to do any kind of impartial investigation into corruption networks in Honduras,"" Cuffe wrote. The failure of homegrown Honduran institutions to score lasting victories in the fight against graft was a major reason for the establishment of the MACCIH. And in other cases, namely Guatemala , independent anti-graft bodies have made significant progress in addressing widespread corruption and impunity. However, MACCIH head Juan Jimenez Mayor recently resigned due to what he claimed was a lack of support from the Organization of American States (OAS), the mission's parent institution, as well as consistent pushback from elites opposed to its anti-corruption efforts. The resignation raised doubts about the future of anti-graft initiatives in Honduras, where the current President Juan Orlando Hernandez is himself facing corruption allegations following a victory in last year's election that was marred by reports of fraud."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"InSight Map: Mexicos Narco-Graves. As Mexican authorities raise the body count for a mass grave discovered last week in the northern state of Tamaulipas, InSight takes a look at the phenomenon of these ""narcofosas,"" where victims of drug violence are disposed of. On April 1, Mexican security forces investigating the abduction of several bus passengers in Tamaulipas stumbled on a series of mass graves located outside the small town of San Fernando, not far from the site of the massacre of 72 mostly Central American migrants in August. Although local media reported that the graves contained a total of 58 bodies in all, officials have raised the total to 72 , which, in an eerie coincidence, exactly matches the number of migrants killed last summer. Authorities have yet to identify all of the bodies, but official say that all those identified so far are Mexican citizens, not migrants. According to Mexico's El Universal, many of the victims were forcibly taken from buses traveling on a local highway, although it is unclear whether they were taken at random or whether the kidnappings represent a kind of forced recruitment. This was reiterated by the local government (see video below). Because authorities have implicated the Zetas criminal syndicate in the killings, the abductions could potentially have been part of a targeted attack on the group's rivals, the Gulf Cartel. Authorities said there were fourteen people captured but did not reveal if they were members of one group or another. Whatever the motive behind the killings, the Tamaulipas ""narco-grave"" is the actually the third such mass burial site to be found this year, after two others were discovered in Mexico State and Guerrero. Although the other graves were much smaller, they were also linked to organized crime. Despite the fact that the media generally portrays all such findings as the result of massacres, most of the graves serve as depositories for area drug gangs looking for a discrete place to hide the executed bodies of their rivals or victims. As such, the bodies are often not all dumped at once, but rather accumulate over a period of time. Below is a map showing the location of the most recent narco-grave discoveries, with a short description of each one. Although it is difficult to deduce any specific pattern from this map, it is worthwhile to note that the graves are more common in states with the most disputed territory between organized criminal gangs, such as Chihuahua, Tamaulipas and Guerrero.

Mexicos Knights Templar Earns $73 Mn Before US Drug Profits. Mexico's Knights Templar earns more than $73 million each year outside of its drug trafficking activities, revealing the diverse criminal portfolio of the group and the difficulties authorities face in tackling it. Raising money from kidnapping and extortion, contraband and counterfeit goods, investments in legitimate businesses, and protection rackets, the group -- which is based in the Pacific coastal state of Michoacan -- earns in excess of $6 million each month, without counting profits from drug sales in the United States, reported Milenio. According to information gathered by Mexican security services and accessed by Milenio, the group earns $2.2 million each month from local drug transportation and sales, and up to $600,000 more from illegal activities such as car theft, kidnapping and the black market. Close to $1 million is raised each month from extorting businesses, while in excess of $1 million comes from extorting local governments. A further $1.3 million comes from legitimate businesses, which are also used to launder illicit profits. The breakdown of the Knights Templar's domestic earnings came on the same day it was announced one of the group's leaders, Leopoldo Jaimes Valladares, had been arrested in possession of military-grade weaponry. Jaimes has been accused by authorities of being behind much of the violence carried out in the state, amid suggestions he was involved in coordinated attacks recently carried out against energy installations. The revelation of just how much the Knights Templar earns, before even taking into consideration revenues from the US drug market, supports the notion that it is now one of Mexico's most powerful criminal groups. Its grip over the port of Lazaro Cardenas -- a key entry and departure point for contraband, drugs and precursor chemicals -- has given it a prominent position within the pacific drug trade; something Mexican authorities have recently tried to address by sending federal forces in to take control of the port. However, previous attempts to confront the Knights Templar with federal force have failed to dislodge the group. Earlier this year a series of attacks against security forces , as well as the assassination of a top naval official -- which were subsequently linked to the Knights Templar -- led to the deployment of federal troops. However the group's power remains unbroken. The biggest challenge the group seems to have faced is the rise of a vigilante self-defense movement , which claims to oppose criminality and has caused the Knights Templar to cut off fuel and food supplies to certain municipalities. However, accusations that a rival criminal group is funding the vigilantes have muddied the waters of an already complex criminal landscape. With the Knights Templar's stronghold now under federal supervision, it remains to be seen whether the group will be adversely affected, or if it will simply return to the fore as soon as federal forces retire.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"The Militarization of Mexico, Again. Struggling to contain rapidly growing self-defense militias that threaten armed clashes with powerful criminal gangs, Mexico's federal government has brokered the hiring of an army special forces commander as public security czar in the central state of Michoacan. Thursday's appointment of Brigadier General Alberto Reyes appears to mock President Enrique Pena Nieto's intent to soften the military-led anti-crime campaign begun by his predecessor, Felipe Calderon. The governor of violent Guerrero, which neighbors Michoacan on Mexico's Pacific Coast and faces its own militia and gangster threats, this week named a navy admiral to head that state's security forces. ""We will seek to work in a coordinated way with the municipalities with the most problems at this moment,"" Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio told a television interviewer , adding that the appointed general would have control over local, state and federal forces in Michoacan. ""I am convinced that in a short time control will be restored."" Calderon said much the same thing when he first dispatched troops to Michoacan, his home state, shortly after taking office in December 2006. The deployment set off pitched multi-sided battles between gangs and security forces that rage in much of northern Mexico and along both coasts to this day. Home to the powerful criminal band the Familia Michoacana and its antagonistic offshoot, the Knights Templar, Michoacan remains one of Mexico's most insecure corners. So-called communitarian police forces, supposedly comprised of volunteers but some armed with outlawed assault weapons, have sprung up in many communities in recent months. Knights Templar leaders have accused the community militias of working on behalf of the rival Jalisco Cartel-New Generation, which is aligned with the Sinaloa Federation of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. The militias in turn have targeted municipal police and mayors , accusing them of working for the Knights Templar. Despite their involvement in drug trafficking, extortion, and kidnapping, both the Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar have always defined themselves in Robin Hood terms, promising to protect state residents against outside gangs and other threats. The security situation has worsened in the few weeks since Michoacan Governor Fausto Vallejo, a member of Pena's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), who won office last year, took a leave of absence to deal with undisclosed health problems that required surgery. Soldiers scrambled Thursday to close off access of outside militiamen to the town of Coalcoman, in Michoacan's tropical ""hot lands"" as some 300 volunteers reportedly gathered in its central plaza. Clashes between militiamen and security forces were reported, though there were no indications of casualties. Insight Crime Analysis Mexico's presidents have been increasingly militarizing the fight against organized crime since the mid-1990s, when President Ernesto Zedillo staffed key attorney general positions and much of the newly created uniformed federal police with soldiers. While Michoacan and Guerrero are particularly troublesome at the moment, soldiers and marines have been dispatched to many corners of Mexico in the past six years as the violence persisted. Cities such as Tijuana, Juarez, Veracruz, and even sophisticated Monterrey have turned their police forces over to control by active duty or recently retired military officers. Yet the continued heavy reliance on military officers and troops to take control of local, state, and federal police forces is telling in light of Pena Nieto's very public attempts to portray Mexico's bloody security crisis as on the mend. To date, Pena Nieto's strategy-in-progress, which he recently said could only be judged after another year, has been to bring both the army and navy - with which U.S. law enforcement and security advisors worked directly - under tighter control of Osorio's Interior Ministry. The ministry this month begins rolling out a national program of social services aimed at alleviating the poverty that helps feed the gangster ranks. And a 10,000 strong militarized police force, to be staffed by transferred soldiers and marines, is being formed this summer for deployment in some of Mexico's more perilous parts. But such measures, and the creation of police forces able to take on the gangs, will take years at best to bear fruit. In the meantime, Pena Nieto will find the military his best and perhaps only option, much as did Calderon. The US supported raids by navy and army special forces against priority gangster targets apparently have ceased. But troops are still patrolling, and clashing often enough with the gangs. ""We haven't changed things,"" General Salvador Cienfuegos, the defense minister, told reporters in Durango. ""It's only that we are avoiding confrontations with the criminals where there are people who have nothing to do with the problem. That makes us less visible, but we are the same and are getting good results."" The defense ministry announced this week that soldiers had arrested nearly 3,500 suspected gangsters since Pena Nieto took office. The ministry didn't release numbers of gangsters killed by soldiers or the troops casualties."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombian Gangs Branch Out into Logging. Colombia's Coast Guard has said that paramilitary successor groups, known as BACRIMs, may be getting increasingly involved in timber trafficking on the Pacific coast as they seek new sources of revenue outside drug trafficking. Colombian Coast Guard officers Carlos Estevez and William Javier Palomino told told El Pais that there is suspicion that the gangs are behind much of the illegal logging in the region. Illegal logging is common along Colombia's densely forested Pacific coast, much of which has little state presence. Even companies that have permits to conduct logging legally frequently ignore restrictions on the amount of lumber they can harvest and the areas they can work in. So far in 2012, the Coast Guard has seized 3,500 cubic meters of illegal timber in the area of the coast between Tumaco and Buenaventura. There is debate about how far illegal logging in Colombia is carried out by organized criminal groups, and how far it is the work of local people who use the trees themselves or sell them on a small scale. In 2009, Colombia's then-environment minister said that there were no big mafia groups involved in the illegal logging business, and that most of it was carried out by locals. However, current President Juan Manuel Santos has said that the illegal timber trade is a source of funding for mafia groups, and that it would be a high value target for the government. It would make sense for BACRIM groups like the Rastrojos and Urabenos to get involved in the timber trade -- they have also been expanding their revenue streams to take in activities like illicit mining. The business is estimated to be worth as much as $200 million a year, making it an attractive source of profits for these gangs. In January, the government announced the creation of a special prosecutor's office tasked with investigating ""environmental crimes,"" including contamination, misuse of protected land and unlicensed exploitation of natural resources. It remains to be seen, however, whether the office will be able to effectively prosecute crimes like logging, which often occur in very remote areas."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Stumbling Towards a Security Policy in El Salvador. El Salvador's two main political parties are scrambling to respond to the nation's historically high homicide rate, but neither appears to be proposing any novel security strategies. The government said it will prioritize dismantling the leadership structure of El Salvador's violent street gangs while also attacking their finances, Vice President Oscar Ortiz said in an interview on TV station Canal 12. Violence between rival gangs like the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Barrio 18, as well as with security forces are the driving factors behind El Salvador's dubious new title as the Western Hemisphere's bloodiest nation. In response authorities are rallying to contain gang-related violence, Ortiz said. ""We've never had this level of prosecution and strategy deployed to strike and dismantle crime, like we do now. But it's going to take some time,"" the Vice President said. Meanwhile a group of legislators from FMLN's conservative rival ARENA plan to introduce a gang member registration bill within the week, El Diario de Hoy reported. The bill would create a list of alleged gang members and their collaborators, making it easier for judges to apply harsher sentencing under a new law that labels gang members as terrorists. The list would also allow gang members without criminal records to participate in a rehabilitation and reintegration program currently being discussed by congress, proponents were quoted as saying. El Salvador's record high 2015 murder figures have made security the major political issue and attracted scrutiny from the international community. Despite this added pressure both parties appear content to continue El Salvador's failed repressive security policies. Ortiz's idea is nothing new. Attacking gang leadership structures and finances is something authorities should already be doing, and a vague promise to do that means little in terms of new security solutions. In the same vein, the ARENA legislators' gang registry bill boils down to ensuring gang members are labeled as terrorists and punished more harshly. This type of response seems all too reminiscent of Central America's "" Mano Dura "" (Iron Fist) initiatives, which have failed to improve El Salvador's security situation in the past. What's telling is that both parties are equally concerned with shifting blame away from themselves. ARENA legislator Rene Portillo Cuadra blamed the Security Ministry for El Salvador's current predicament and called on President Salvador Sanchez Ceren to replace his security cabinet. Likewise Ortiz blamed past administrations for 15 years of ""no public policies to confront or contain [gang] expansion."" However with no real change in security policy and President Ceren's adamant stance to not renew controversial talks with gang leaders , it seems likely El Salvador will see a continuation of the record violence that plagued it in 2015.

"Mexico Trumpets Arrest of Most-Wanted Zetas Leader. Armed forces in Mexico arrested an alleged leader of the Zetas who was on the country's most-wanted list, but the longstanding policy of targeting top crime bosses could be contributing to the country's rising violence. On February 8, Mexican marines arrested Jose Maria Guizar Valencia, alias ""Z43,"" the alleged leader of a Zetas faction operating along Mexico's southern border with Guatemala. In a statement to the press , National Security Commissioner Renato Sales Heredia said that Z43 was among the Mexican government's 122 most sought-after criminal suspects, and described him as ""one of the principal generators of violence in the southwest of Mexico."" Z43 is a California-born US citizen belonging to the Guizar family thought to have a presence in the southern Mexican states of Tabasco and Veracruz, as well as in the United States. Officials accuse him of involvement in trafficking drugs from South America. Z43 is likely related to Mauricio Guizar Cardenas, alias ""El Amarillo,"" the first Zetas commander in charge of Guatemala. El Amarillo was arrested in 2012 and accused of ordering a 2011 massacre in the Guatemalan department of Peten, a key drug trafficking region on Mexico's southern border. Since 2014, the US State Department has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Z43's arrest. According to the US government, Z43 ""assumed complete command and control of his own faction of Los Zetas in the Southern region of Mexico"" following the successive deaths and arrests of his predecessors. The US government has accused Z43 of ordering the murders of Guatemalan civilians during his Zetas faction's takeover of the Mexico-Guatemala border region in recent years, as well as trafficking cocaine and methamphetamine into the United States. Three US courts have indicted Z43 on drug trafficking charges. The Zetas have largely lost their one-time reputation as one of Mexico's most powerful and feared cartels, in part due to the demise of a number of top leaders like Z43 in recent years. But Mexico's crime-fighting approach of capturing high-profile cartel leaders like Z43 has proven to have little long-term success in disrupting criminal activities, and may be contributing to rising violence. Throughout the 2000s, the Zetas' roots in the special forces of Mexico's army and their emphasis on bloodshed helped the group to rapidly and relentlessly expand. But with the Zetas' founders and subsequent leaders dead or in prison, the criminal organization is becoming increasingly fractured and weak. Yet Mexico's kingpin strategy of picking off leader after leader is not a sustainable or effective policy for bringing down criminal groups or reducing violence. As InSight Crime recently reported , ""the problem with this approach is that 'success' begets more violence, as a fallen capo's erstwhile lieutenants and rivals scramble to fill the vacuum left by his departure."""	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Did Brazil Capo Plot to Assassinate Paraguays President?Authorities in Paraguay say that Brazilian crime boss Jarvis Chimenes Pavao hatched a plot to assassinate President Horacio Cortes, but politicians and media outlets have called into question the veracity of these allegations. Citing intelligence reports, Interior Minister Francisco De Vargas said on September 2 that Pavao had put a $5 million bounty on the head of President Cortes and his family, reported Hoy.com. The head of Paraguay's National Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD), Hugo Vera, also said that Pavao was planning to kill the president. Brazilian hit men had reportedly crossed into Paraguay to carry out the attack ordered by Pavao, who had lived a life of luxury in eastern Paraguay before US, Brazilian and Paraguayan authorities arrested him in 2009. Pavao replicated the relative luxury of his lifestyle inside his spacious cell in Tacumbu prison, which was equipped with a kitchen, air conditioning, several televisions and a sound system, among other items. But in late July, Cortes ordered security forces to move the crime boss to a special police facility, bringing an end to his stay in what one local media outlet said resembled a hotel spa more than a prison cell. Shortly after the transfer orders, prison guards deactivated a bomb that inmates had allegedly planted within the facility on orders from Pavao. Interior Minister De Vargas said the alleged plot to assassinate Cortes was also motivated by Pavao's transfer. Some politicians and media outlets have raised doubts about the allegations of Pavao ordering a hit on President Cortes. Leading opposition figures have said the report is a way to deflect attention from the government's shortcomings in terms of security. For its part, Paraguayan newspaper ABC Color said it was "" striking "" that the authorities maintained they have been aware for some time of the attempt to kill Cortes, but they only publicly released the information shortly after the killing of eight soldiers in late August. Authorities suspect that rebel group the Paraguayan People's Army (Ejercito del Pueblo Paraguayo - EPP) was responsible for the deadly attack. Multiple news outlets have also noted that the authorities disseminated the information pertaining to the alleged assassination plot to Hoy.com, which is owned and operated by the Cortes family. To be sure, Pavao has demonstrated the power he wields within the Paraguayan prison system by acquiring an opulent cell and allegedly engineering the attempt to destabilize the Tacumbu facility in July. But assassinating the president would be a qualitative leap in terms of the reach of his influence outside the prison system. After all, Pavao has been imprisoned in Paraguay since 2009, so it seems questionable that he could mobilize Brazilian hit men to cross the border in order to carry out such a high-risk proposition. This isn't the first time that an alleged attempt by criminals to kill a president in Latin America has been called into question. Honduran authorities claimed they foiled a plot by a group of drug traffickers from several different countries to assassinate President Juan Orlando Hernandez in September 2014. InSight Crime noted, however, that the report may have simply been a way to improve his standing with the Honduran people or even insulate him from any potential accusations of narco corruption."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Hitmans Death Highlights Argentina as R&R Site for Drug Traffickers. Argentina has long been considered a safe haven from the violence of the drug trade in Latin America, but the assassination of a former henchman of Colombian crime boss ""Loco"" Barrera in Buenos Aires last week indicates it may no longer be the refuge it once was. Argentina police said that a man killed April 17 in northern Buenos Aires is Jairo Saldarriaga, alias ""Mojarro,"" a former associate of one of Colombia's most prolific drug traffickers, Daniel Barrera, alias "" El Loco ."" The irony is that Saldarriaga, a former member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) who was recruited by Barrera to run a network of assassins in Colombia's Eastern Plains, had killed in Buenos Aires on Barrera's behalf, according to reports. He is believed to have coordinated the assassination of two of Barrera's rivals in an affluent Buenos Aires mall in 2008, in a shoot-out which shocked the country. It appears that when Saldarriaga fell out of Barrera's favor in 2011, he also sought refuge in the Argentine capital. The Friday before his death, he spoke with a lawyer in Buenos Aires, saying that he wanted to live permanently in the country and that he feared for his safety. Saldarriaga had reason to be afraid. In 2011, he stole a cocaine shipment which belong to Barrera, reportedly as large as 500 kilos, and tried to sell it for his own gain. Barrera responded by ordering Saldarriaga's assassination. Gunmen opened fire on a soccer pitch in Villavicencio, the largest city of Colombia's Eastern Plains, leaving six people dead, but Saldarriaga escaped. If Saldarriaga thought that he could live in relative safety in Argentina, it is another indication of the country's increased importance as a refuge for Colombian drug traffickers looking to lie low, especially those with connections to Barrera's network. Just last week, Argentine police arrested Barrera's ex-wife in a gated community in Buenos Aires province. Another one of Barrera's associates, Luis Agustin Caicedo Velandia, alias ""Lucho,"" was arrested in Buenos Aires in 2010. Various Colombian criminal groups are known to use Argentina as an area for rest and recreation. This includes former members of the Norte del Valle Cartel, as well as a former beauty queen who caused a media frenzy when she was arrested in Buenos Aires in 2010, charged with running a massive drug smuggling network. Part of the reason why Colombian groups have found it expedient to set up shop in Argentina is the country's increased importance as a transit nation for the cocaine trade. Argentina is the jumping-off point for traffickers looking to ship their product to Europe, either through Spain or their West Africa connections. But Argentina plays another important role in the drug economy: according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) , has the highest prevelance of cocaine use among adults In South America. Foreign drug cartels may be attracted to Argentina as a convenient transit point to Europe, but the country's domestic maket also brings in big profits. With more cocaine passing through Argentina, international drug traffickers often pay Argentine drug mules in product rather than cash, allowing them to sell locally. As in Central America, this has caused domestic consumption of cocaine and by-products like crack to rise rapidly. Argentina's increased prominence in the drug trade led Foreign Policy to describe the country in a recent article as ""the new narco state."" The headline is sensational and inaccurate, since the term ""narco state"" is usually used to refer to a government that has been overwhelmingly infiltrated by drug traffickers. But as the case of Saldarriaga shows, there are plenty of Colombian traffickers for whom Argentina represents a safe and comfortable place to operate. Ultimately, however, Saldarriaga could not escape from Barrera: just one hour after he met with a lawyer to discuss setting up a new identity in Argentina, he was gunned down by his former boss.

Mexico Grabs Growing Role in Meth Market. Mexican cartels are the key suppliers of methamphetamine for the growing U.S. market, as a new report from the Wall Street Journal highlights. The newspaper reports that meth consumed in the U.S. is increasingly produced on a mass scale in Mexico, and then smuggled over the border. The report poin ts to the record quantity of meth seized on the U.S.-Mexico border so far in 2011 -- more than 5.5 tons. (See the WSJ's graph, left, for a comparison with previous years.) Meanwhile, the Mexican authorities have busted 103 clandestine meth labs in the first six months of the year -- 25 percent higher than the same period last year. Labs in the U.S. are generally much smaller, according to the report, often with the capacity to produce less that 60 grams. (See photo of a home lab, above.) In contrast, in May the Mexican security forces found a lab with the capacity to produce 150 kilos of the drug a day. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has said that some 80 percent of the U.S.'s methamphetamine comes from in Mexico. As InSight Crime has reported , one of the factors in the rise in meth production south of the border is the fact that the U.S. has tightened controls on precursor chemicals used to produce the drug, shifting the business to Mexico. Another factor, highlighted by the WSJ, is the Mexican government's crackdown on organized crime, which has pushed some criminals to move into the easier-to-produce meth, instead of heroin and cocaine. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"New Mexico ""Narcotunnel"" Again Showcases Cartels Engineering Skills. Mexico's cartels continue to flaunt their engineering capabilities with the discovery of a drug trafficking tunnel on the US-Mexico border, drawing further attention to the growing power of one of the country's younger criminal organizations. Mexican authorities have discovered an 800-metre long ""narcotunnel"" on the border between Tijuana and San Diego, simultaneously seizing around 10 tons of marijuana destined for the United States. Sixteen men between 21 and 50 years of age were arrested on site. They later admitted to involvement in drug trafficking and to having links with what appears to be the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG), according to Proceso. The 10-metre deep tunnel was built with a railway line for transporting drugs, lighting, ventilation and metal support beams. The entrance was located in a Tijuana neighborhood after weeks of police investigation. This most recent narcotunnel is an impressive engineering feat even compared to the Mexican cartels' past exploits, measuring 300 meters more than a 2013 "" super tunnel "" described as one of the most sophisticated structures of its kind ever to be discovered. Indeed, narcotunnels aren't a new tactic for Mexican cartels, and have been popping up along the border for years. The Sinaloa Cartel's Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, the country's most wanted man, has built quite a name for himself as a tunnels expert, and used an underground passageway to escape from a high-security prison in July 2015. What this new tunnel does go to show is that whoever constructed it - and fingers are pointing to the Jalisco Cartel - has a significant amount of wealth and power in the region. This relatively new arrival to the underworld has already been touted as Mexico's most powerful drug trafficking organization. They have flexed their muscle in recent months by ambushing police officers and even shooting down a military helicopter. But do these shows of strength and technical ability place CJNG above their rivals? Fighting over territorial control in Tijuana - a key drug transit point - has seen the decline of the once mighty Arellano Felix organization, and the rise of the Sinaloa Cartel. According to the DEA other drug trafficking groups, such as the CJNG, have also been shifting cargo across the border with the permission of the Sinaloans. It is possible that this new cartel is among the country's strongest at the moment, but whether or not it can operate independently on such strategic territory without Sinaloa Cartel blessing is questionable."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
UN Threatens to Sanction Paraguay for Wildlife Smuggling. The UN may sanction Paraguay for failing to properly monitor its trade in wildlife, a reminder that the country's smuggling networks -- which already move drugs, weapons, and contraband goods through the Southern Cone -- can also adapt themselves to eco-trafficking. If Paraguay does not amend its legislation and enforce stronger regulations against eco-traffickers by October 1, it could lose its right to engage in the legal wildlife trade, following a decision by United Nations (UN) conservation delegates meeting this week in Geneva, Switzerland. Paraguay is one of seven countries to face sanctions for failing to enforce its laws against wildlife smuggling, the Associated Press (AP) reported. According to one UN spokesman, these sanctions would make it illegal for Paraguay to trade in any of the 35,000 species protected under the 175-country Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( Cites ), a treaty managed by the Geneva-based UN Environment Program. Another AP report noted that conservationists are most concerned about species such as jaguars and tamarins (squirrel-sized monkeys, see picture) that are smuggled from Paraguay, as well as various types of flora. As the AP reported, wildlife smuggling nets criminal groups worldwide between $16 billion and $27 billion a year, according to Cites estimates. The UN's warning is a reminder that Paraguay's smuggling networks, which bring in billions of dollars a year, can easily be used to move flora and fauna, along with other illicit goods like weapons and drugs. Smugglers of various types are especially entrenched in Ciudad del Este, a border town that offers access to Brazil and Argentina. Given Paraguay's rich biodiversity, lax law enforcement, and well-developed contraband networks, it is no surprise that the scale of eco-trafficking there warranted a warning from UN conservation authorities. However, even if Paraguay creates new regulations against the trade, the question is whether these laws can properly be enforced. A high rate of official corruption has contributed to Paraguay's status as a regional smuggling hub. 	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Hundreds Arrested in North Mexico Human Trafficking Bust. Mexico's government has claimed that more than 1,000 people were arrested in an operation against human trafficking in Ciudad Juarez, while the state's attorney general said the figure was only 400. According to the Secretariat of Public Security (SSP) , over 1,000 people were arrested and 20 under-aged females were rescued by federal police in the operation, which took place in 24 bars, three hotels and two guest houses in the city. However, according to the Attorney General's Office of Chihuahua , the state that Ciudad Juarez is located in, only 400 people were arrested, and five girls rescued. The operation was carried out as part of AMBER Alert program, which was originally designed as a child abduction warning system in the United States. Sayra Duran Sanchez, who had been missing since May 31, was among the rescued. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Mexico Gives Muddled Response to Damning Human Rights Report. Human Rights Watch provided a thorough critique of Mexico 's anti-crime policies, describing a growing pattern of abuses by security officials against a backdrop of stratospheric levels of violence, but the government's response seems wrong-headed. The document, which was published last week and is titled "" Neither Rights Nor Security ,"" argues that Calderon's aggressive combat of criminal groups has failed on two fronts: it has utterly failed to rein in the violence, and it has proven unwilling or incapable of fielding a security force that does not carry out human rights violations. The New York-based NGO spent two years compiling the report, which focuses on three different classifications of abuse: torture, enforced disappearances (in which security agencies are suspected of participating), and extrajudicial killings. As the report's authors write: Human Rights Watch found evidence of a significant increase in human rights violations since Calderon launched his ""war on organized crime."" In the five states examined, members of security forces systematically use torture to obtain forced confessions and information about criminal groups. And evidence points to the involvement of soldiers and police in extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances around the country. The patterns of violations that emerge in the accounts of victims and eyewitnesses, an analysis of official data, and interviews with government officials, law enforcement officers, and civil society groups strongly suggest that the cases documented in this report are not isolated acts. Rather, they are examples of abusive practices endemic to the current public security strategy. The report also discusses the inadequacies of the government's attempts to limit such abuses. Accusations are frequently ignored or downgraded by prosecutors, while government officials often blame the victim by assuming that anyone unlucky enough to be victimized by soldiers or police must have had it coming. Furthermore, just 16 out of 32 Mexican states (including the federal district of Mexico City) have specific laws against torture, while only a quarter have legislation explicitly banning enforced disappearances. Calderon responded, as he has in the past, by saying the main threat to citizens is from criminals, not the government. It is almost certainly true that the human rights violators represent a small minority of the government officials, while violating human rights is a rather fundamental part of most gangs' operations, but in his response, Calderon is skirting the issue. The most obvious flaw with Calderon's logic is that he is comparing apples to oranges -- the criminal gangs are more abusive precisely because they are criminal gangs. If the best the government can do to address the issues raised by the HRW report is to say that the criminals are worse, it's hard to imagine a more damning indictment. Furthermore, while the government is understandably embarrassed by the content of the report, the automatic assumption that the ultimate interests of HRW and the Mexican government are in conflict is short-sighted. One point that does not get made often enough is that the abuses outlined in the report are not the case of a juggernaut government stepping on a few toes while otherwise doing a good job; they are symptomatic of a broadly ineffective force unable to keep up with the demands of the task at hand. If the Mexican military and police agencies were less prone to extra-legal activities, than they would almost certainly be more effective in their pursuit of criminals. The authors of the HRW report point to the rising violence in Mexico as a sign that the government's policies are failing. Here the evidence is a bit less clear. The government's claim is essentially that their aggressive stance against criminals, resulting in many clashes and deaths, is necessary because of years of official collusion or indifference regarding organized crime. The argument is that things have to get worse before they can get better. In other words, insofar as it is related to the government's strategy and not the dynamics within the drug trade, the violence today is the necessary byproduct of investment in a safer future for Mexico. That is not implausible, and if it proves true, it will be an effective rejoinder to those who say all the suffering has been in vain. However, it is an impossible claim to prove today. Consequently, Calderon is asking Mexico to endure an enormous amount of bloodshed in exchange for an improvement at an undetermined point in the future. A further problem with with Calderon's argument, and an inherent flaw with any strategy that entails a huge upsurge in violence for uncertain future gains, is that if he's wrong, it won't be Calderon who has to pick up the pieces, as he leaves office in December 2012. Unfortunately, the Mexicans bearing the burden of the criminal battles have nowhere to go. "	0	1	0	1	0	0	0
Mexico Soldiers Arrested for Involvement in Killings of 22 People. Eight military personnel have been arrested in Mexico for their involvement in a June incident that left 22 civilians dead, fueling suspicions that the supposed confrontation with alleged criminals may have actually been a massacre. Was it excessive force or an execution? In a press release, Mexico's Secretary of National Defense (Sedena) revealed that on September 25 one officer and seven soldiers were handed over to a military court for their alleged participation in the June 30 incident, reported El Universal. All eight have been charged with breach of duty, while the officer also faces additional charges of crimes against military discipline and disobedience. Mexico's Attorney General's Office and the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) are also carrying out separate investigations, reported Excelsior. Sedena officials told El Universal that all 25 military personnel who were involved in the incident have been taken to a military base in Mexico City so they can testify. Although the incident remains shrouded in mystery, the recent arrests indicate that something went terribly wrong in the early hours of June 30. According to the official version of events , an army patrol stumbled across a group of armed men guarding a warehouse in the municipality of Tlatlaya in the state of Mexico (abbreviated as Edomex). The men allegedly fired on the soldiers, who shot back, killing one woman and 21 men without suffering any casualties. The soldiers also freed three women who were supposedly being held hostage at the warehouse. Witnesses have cast this version of events into doubt, however, claiming that the individuals at the warehouse had surrendered before the army opened fire. One survivor -- one of the women who was found tied up in the warehouse -- said the soldiers altered the crime scene after the gun battle by moving several bodies. It remains unclear what really happened. One possibility is that the army patrol may have simply overreacted and used excessive force -- a tendency the army has previously been criticized for by human rights groups. It is also possible that something more sinister took place, however. Mexican military officials have been accused in the past of ties to organized crime groups, making it conceivable that the army patrol in this case could have been working on behalf of a rival criminal group that paid them to kill the individuals at the warehouse. A similar incident occurred in Colombia in 2006, when members of the military that the Prosecutor General's Office initially claimed were working for drug traffickers massacred 10 police officers and one civilian informant conducting an anti-narcotics operation.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Buried Truth: A Look at Mass Graves in Mexico. The problem of forced disappearances and mass graves in Mexico is greater than what the state claims. Reports regarding the location of clandestine graves are increasingly common, yet they aren't adequately reflected in official statistics or statements. InSight Crime spoke with relatives of the disappeared, activists and experts -- all of them point to the same problem: Until now, the true magnitude of the situation is unknown and the political will to face up to it is lacking. The residential area of Colinas de Santa Fe is located about 15 minutes from the entrance to the city of Veracruz. Here, residents lack basic services, with sewage problems and streets in poor conditions. Behind the houses, there is a huge fenced lot with three gates, guarded 24 hours a day, some with security cameras. It is here that a group made up of more than 100 mothers of missing young people have found more than 260 buried bodies in some 130 mass graves over a period of nine months. Lucia Diaz, who heads the group known as the "" Solecito Collective ,"" speaks without fear. In a telephone conversation with InSight Crime, she talked about how she searches for her son, but also for the lost relatives of her companions. Together they have become full-time grave seekers, searching five days a week for the last two years. ""On the first day that we worked, I grabbed the clumps of dirt with my hands and found bones,"" Diaz said. ""We are sure that we are still missing many bodies. We have no doubt. We do not know how many and don't want to leave anyone behind."" Some of the young people were abducted by criminal groups. Others disappeared after being detained by authorities. For the devastated families, the state's reaction has been yet another source of anguish. Its response has been woefully insufficient, and authorities have gone as far as trying to discredit victims by saying they were ""going down the wrong path."" Colinas de Santa Fe is the largest set of mass graves found in Mexico so far, but the problem has affected the entire country. For years, criminal groups have buried thousands of their victims to avoid them being found, often with the complicity of authorities. This has occurred in a context of over 130,000 lives being lost in the first decade of the war on drugs , according to estimates, and criminal groups exercising more control than the government itself over some areas of the country. A Buried Reality Despite the alarming discovery of mass graves like Colinas de Santa Fe, some state governments have occasionally referred to them as isolated incidents or have taken a stance of denial. However, according to official figures , about 1,143 mass graves that have been located across the country since 2007, in which at least 3,230 bodies have been unearthed. Additionally, there are about 30,000 missing persons , according to government records. While these figures alone already signify a widespread problem, the activists interviewed by InSight Crime assert that these numbers are still far from representing reality. ""By simply doing field work in any of the country's states, particularly in those where most conflict occurs, such as Guerrero and Veracruz, one realizes that there is a very high unrecorded rate,"" Carolina Robledo told InSight Crime. Robledo is a researcher at the Center for Research and Higher Studies in Social Anthropology (Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropologia Social - CIESAS) who has accompanied several relatives of the disappeared. According to Robledo, the majority of cases regarding the disappeared are not reported and do not appear in official records. This makes it impossible to determine the real number of persons that may be buried in mass graves. One of the main reasons for not reporting a disappearance is fear of endangering oneself and the rest of one's family. Generally, disappearances occur in places with a substantial presence of criminal groups, which in some cases infiltrate government structures. Several relatives of missing people in Mexico have been murdered in retaliation for their complaints and investigations -- most recently, the May 10 murder of Miriam Rodriguez in the state of Tamaulipas. Criminal groups ""instill fear in you: 'Do not search for your relative because we will screw everyone else. We already know where they are,'"" said Mario Vergara, an activist who dedicates himself to searching for mass graves in the state of Guerrero. Lucia Diaz says that in some cases the authorities themselves prevent people from filing reports, by assuring victims that ""it is not necessary"" or by processing the complaint improperly. Robledo believes that the fact that people do not report is, at least in part, a consequence of the unsatisfactory manner in which the state has responded to disappearances. On the other hand, however, the continued underreporting of these figures allows local governments to continue ignoring the problem. ""The government itself has caused people to not want to report; from there they start minimizing the problem,"" Vergara said. ""They [the government] want to continue burying the truth."" Unearthing the Disappeared Mario Vergara is part of the search group "" Los Otros Desaparecidos de Iguala "" (""The Other Disappeared from Iguala""). This group was formed following the disappearance of 43 students from the small city of Iguala in the state of Guerrero in 2014. It was a case that received international attention and showcased the inability of the Mexican state to uncover the facts and find the students. The whereabouts of these students are still unknown, but during the search for them many other bodies were found buried in the fields of Guerrero. This led many others to organize and search for their own missing relatives. The group to which Mario belongs has already found about 170 bodies since they began their search in early 2015. In Mexico, there are legal statutes that address the issue of disappearances and even a specialized prosecutor for the search of missing persons. However, relatives are forced to overcome a series of bureaucratic challenges, corruption and a lack of capacity or willingness on the part of authorities to help them resolve their cases. The years pass, and their loved ones still do not appear. ""The government looks for our relatives in an office and they are not there,"" Vergara said. That is why Vergara, Diaz and thousands of others who make up more than 70 search groups around the country have been forced to unearth bodies from mass graves using their own means, hoping to find the remains of their relatives. ""We go to the places where [criminal groups] were based, we go to the places where our relatives disappeared. We are doing so because the authorities do not do it,"" Vergara said. Search groups in Iguala, Guerrero. Video courtesy of Animal Politico. When members of The Other Disappeared find a grave, the first thing they do is call news reporters -- pressure from the media helps them get the government to come to the scene and take responsibility for ""lifting"" the bodies. ""The search groups take charge of doing the complete investigation,"" says Robledo. ""They locate the place, explore it, and escalate it. They only call the government at the moment in which the bodies will be exhumed."" To locate the mass graves, Vergara and his companions depend, in large part, on help from churches. In Iguala, kidnappings and murders are frequent and many citizens have witnessed clandestine burials; churches have offered these individuals a trusted channel through which they can anonymously provide information to search groups. In other cases, the search groups have found informants within the criminal groups themselves, former police officers or even public officials. There are also cases in which family members infiltrate neighborhoods where organized crime groups operate in order to obtain information. ""The government does not conduct [the search] with the resources they have available to them. We do it using our own means,"" says Diaz, the coordinator for the Solecito Collective. The Other Headache Of all the bodies that the group of mothers has found, only two individuals have been identified so far. Authorities have yet to arrest anyone, but it is known that police officials participated in some of these disappearances and that Veracruz's ex-secretary of public security was also involved. Griselda Barradas, of the Solecito Collective,is the mother of one of the victims identified in Colinas de Santa Fe. Video courtesy of Animal Politico. The process of genetic identification can take anywhere from six months to up to four years. On the one had, it depends on the condition in which the body was found, which varies depending on the modus operandi of the criminal group that carried out the act. Robledo says that in Veracruz, for example, the majority of the bodies are found incinerated and in fragments; in Sinaloa, it is generally whole bodies with clothes; and in places like Coahuila, where the Zetas used to reign, body parts are found. On the other hand, the duration of the identification process also depends on political will. Robledo believes that the speed of these processes depend on the priority the government gives them. When there is a case that generates the kind of attention that could affect the government's reputation, that case will be given priority and the rest will have to wait. ""This prevents alot of investigations of cases that have been around for years from advancing,"" Robledo said. Additionally, there are very few personnel capable of carrying out the identification processes. Joel Olvera, a member of the Mexican Forensic Anthropology Team (Equipo Mexicano de Antropologia Forense - EMAF), told InSight Crime that there are only five certified laboratories in the entire country and less than ten forensic anthropologists in the Attorney General's Office (Procuraduria General de la Republica - PGR). The EMAF is one of the independent teams dedicated to supporting family members in their identification of the bodies and training them on how to strengthen their investigations. ""These crimes are generally not investigated,"" Diaz said. ""When they are investigated, a culprit is not found. When they are found, they are not processed. And even if they are processed, they are not sentenced."" Mario Vergara says that he has all the proof of who abducted his brother, which he has shared with authorities. That was four years ago. Today, there has yet to be a serious official investigation into the case. ""It is a rampant impunity,"" Diaz said. ""Everything ends without justice."""	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Bolivia-Sinaloa Links Suggest Mexico Cartel Expansion. A Bolivian pilot shot dead while trying to fly cocaine out of Peru was reportedly linked to the Sinaloa Cartel, suggesting Mexican cartels are moving in on European trafficking routes through Bolivia and Brazil. Angel Roca Rivera was killed in a shootout with Peruvian anti-drug police as he attempted to take off with 270 kilos of cocaine from a clandestine airstrip in the region of Pasco in central Peru, reported El Comercio. Two Peruvian gunmen were subsequently captured in the operation. According to security forces sources consulted by Peruvian newspaper La Republica , Roca worked for a group based in Bolivia that is affiliated with Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. The sources said he made up to four flights a week moving cocaine produced in the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valley (VRAEM). The drugs were then moved on to Brazil before before being exported to Europe. The drug trafficking corridor moving Peruvian cocaine to Brazil via the ""air bridge"" of Bolivia is now a well-established route for drugs headed both to Brazil's large domestic market and for export to the booming European market. However, this route is more commonly associated with Colombian drug traffickers and Brazilian gangs such as the First Capital Command (PCC), which has been expanding its role in the transnational drug trade. The European market is also more traditionally associated with Colombian traffickers, who have long had connections with the Italian mafia, especially the main players in the regional cocaine trade, the 'Ndrangheta. The fact that the Bolivian pilot appears to have been working for the Sinaloa Cartel suggests the Mexicans are now muscling in on this route. It also adds weight to concerns that Mexican cartels are looking to expand their influence in Europe. The Peru to Brazil route is far away from home for the Mexicans, and expanding into Europe means creating new networks rather than relying on firmly established supply and distribution operations in the United States. However, with cocaine use falling in the United States and rising in Europe, the expansion could prove lucrative for the Mexicans, and as they have eclipsed the Colombians as the main players in the global cocaine trade they are more than capable of seizing control of new routes and markets."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Surge of Detainees in Mexico Suggests Violence Still Fueling Child Migration. The number of Central American child migrants detained in Mexico increased by nearly 50 percent during the first part of 2015, suggesting high levels of gang violence in the Northern Triangle region continue to act as a primary driver of displacement. On June 21, Mexico's National Immigration Institute (INM) announced authorities have detained 11,893 minors from Central America during the first five months of 2015, a 49 percent increase from the number of child detainees during the same period in 2014. The INM said the majority of the children stopped by Mexican authorities are from Central America's Northern Triangle countries (El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala). More than half of the minors were traveling alone or were accompanied by a human smuggler, according to the INM. Seventy-two percent of the children were detained in the southern states of Tabasco, Veracruz, and Chiapas. The increase in detentions of minors in Mexico comes amid a significant decline in the number of Central Americans attempting illegal crossings at the US-Mexico border. In early June, the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) used data from the INM and the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to determine that Mexico is now detaining more Central American migrants than the United States. The upswing in child migrants getting caught in southern Mexico indicates minors are still fleeing the Northern Triangle in large numbers, even though detentions at the US border have fallen. If this is indeed the case, it suggests high rates of gang violence in the Northern Triangle -- a commonly cited cause for last year's ""surge"" of child migrants -- is continuing to drive children from their homes. In 2014, a number of experts on the child migrant issue told InSight Crime many minors are fleeing in order to escape violence and other forms of insecurity they face in their home countries. However, there are other prominent push and pull factors impacting child migration from the Northern Triangle, such as high levels of poverty and well-established migration routes. And a 2014 study by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) was unable to definitively establish a correlation between insecurity in the region and child migration patterns. Although the INM did not specify which Northern Triangle countries the child detainees came from, this information may be useful in gaining a better understanding of the direct link between insecurity and migrant flows. Violence in El Salvador -- fueled in part by increasing aggression between gangs and security forces -- has skyrocketed in 2015 , while authorities and independent violence observatories in Honduras have reported a significant decrease in homicides."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Increase in Drug Flights, Insecurity does not Bode Well for Honduras. Since the removal of US radar technology last month, Honduras has been made more vulnerable to a growing number of drug flights. Coupled with recent data showing the country's homicide rate at 91 per 100,000 last year, this Central American nation is sliding further into the hands of organized crime. Ramon Custodio, the head of Honduras' human rights commission (known by its acronym CONADEH), announced that drug trafficking flights passing through Honduras have increased by some 89 percent in the last year. According to Custodio, the country's location at the heart of the Central American isthmus -- the principal trafficking route for US-bound cocaine -- coupled with the installation last October of a radar in the Dominican Republic to monitor drug flights, has meant traffickers are increasingly turning to Honduran air space to move cocaine from South America. Exacerbating this further was the decision by the US to remove its radar technology from the country on August 18 due to the unilateral action by the Honduran Air Force in shooting down two suspected drug flights in July. This was not only in contravention of Honduran law and but also an agreement the country has with the US. The decision led Custodio to declare Honduras as being ""open skies for drug trafficking."" The US ambassador to Honduras, Lisa Kubiske, stated that the US will re-install the radar technology soon. However, Honduras has already begun receiving offers from other countries for technological assistance, including radar. Leading the way are Brazil and Israel , reported La Prensa, though Spain, France, Argentina and Holland have all offered aid as well. Defense Minister Marlon Pascua underscored the need for technological aid from outside, telling press that much of the country's existing equipment to combat drug trafficking is outdated , reported Prensa Libre. ""The boats [that we have] are over 40 years old and the aircraft date back to the 1980s,"" he lamented. Many of the Hondruan media outlets reported that, prior to the 89 percent increase, the country served as a transit point for 26 percent of cocaine flights coming from South America. This is likely an underestimation, with the US State Department stating the figure to be 79 percent in its 2012 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, making Custodio's assertion all the more alarming. While Custodio's reasoning behind the rise is accurate, it omits some crucial country-specific factors which make Honduras such a key transhipment point for drug flights. The removal of US radar technology has doubtless hurt the country, though the endemic levels of police corruption and a deteriorating security situation also make it an ideal option for traffickers. The National Congress' vice president, Marvin Ponce, declared last July that some 40 percent of the country's police force had ties to organized crime. Compounding this are recently released statistics by the Organization of American States (OAS) showing that the country's homicide rate for 2011 was 91.6 per 100,000 inhabitants , a jump from 51 per 100,000 in 2000. The United Nations' estimate is 86 per 100,000. Either figure makes Honduras one of the world's most deadly nations. While Honduras' security situation over the last decade has been precarious, the 2009 coup threw the country into a state of further insecurity from which it shows no signs of being able to exit. This, in conjunction with weak and corrupt security forces, has been detrimental to the aid received from international donors. The US have been at the forefront of counter-narcotics assistance, but this is far from unconditional. This has been shown not only by the removal of radar intelligence, but also with the suspension of aid to police units under the command of the new police chief, Juan Carlos Bonilla, due to claims he previously ran death squads. As Central America's second poorest country after Nicaragua, Honduras lacks resources to purchase its own equipment. As InSight Crime noted at the beginning of 2012, Honduras' outlook was dim. With reported increases in drug trafficking activity and homicide levels, things just got a little bleaker."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Urabenos Capture May Shake Up Turf War in Southwest Colombia. Colombian police have captured alias ""Martin Bala,"" a leader of drug trafficking orgaization the Urabenos, whose war with rival organization the Rastrojos in Colombia's third biggest city has led to thousands of deaths. Greylin Fernando Varon Cadena is accused of leading the Urabenos in Colombia's southwestern Valle del Cauca department, as Semana magazine reports. He is also believed to have been the main contact and coordinator for Orlando Gutierrez Rendon, alias ""Negro Orlando,"" a key leader of the Urabenos in the region who was captured three weeks ago in Cali. Varon lived in Spain for a number of years, where two of his sisters ran a drug trafficking ring that brought in cocaine from Colombia. He returned to Valle de Cauca in 2008 in order help wage a war against the Rastrojos. More than 2,000 people are estimated to have died in the department as a result of the fighting. Varon's bloody dispute with the Rastrojos dates back to the mid 2000s, when he worked for a splinter faction of the Norte del Valle cartel. The cartel's military wing, led by brothers Javier Antonio and Luis Calle Serna , would later form the basis of the organization now known as the Rastrojos. After the Calle Serna brothers attempted to have Varon killed in 2005, Varon moved to Spain, and it is believed that he only returned to Colombia to seek revenge, allying himself with the Urabenos in the process. With Varon and Negro Orlando both captured, the question is whether the southwestern cell of the Urabenos will remain strong enough to continue the conflict in Valle de Cauca. In a previous serious blow to the organization , police captured another key ally, Hector Mario Urdinola, alias ""Chicho,"" in January. While the Rastrojos has suffered some serious setbacks of their own, including the arrest of Javier Antonio Serna last year, Valle del Cauca is their home turf, and the Urabenos have had a difficult time cementing control here -- as demonstrated, in part, by the ongoing violence."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Megateo: Rise of a Narco Guerrilla. The leader of the sole remaining faction of the demobilized EPL guerrilla army is a top target of Colombian and US authorities and has been portrayed as the main power in the protest-wracked Catatumbo region, raising the question: why is the leader of such a small group such a big deal? Victor Ramon Navarro Serrano, alias ""Megateo,"" is the leader of the ""Libardo Mora Toro"" Front of the Popular Liberation Army (EPL), a dissident faction of the Maoist guerrilla movement that officially disbanded in 1991. Megateo has a $1 million price on his head from Colombian authorities , who consider him the most important drug trafficker in the department of Norte de Santander, while US authorities have offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture on international drug trafficking and money laundering charges. Recently, Colombian authorities accused Megateo of inciting the popular protests that have swept through the Catatumbo region of Norte de Santander, leading to several deaths and a host of injuries as protesters clashed with police. The protests were sparked by coca eradication efforts in a region that is a major center for illicit coca production and has little state presence. In a first-time interview with Semana magazine , Megateo denied claims that he was heading or financing the protests: ""We support any type of struggle. We are not leading this [protest] with those peasants. They are there for their own reasons and we do not need to infiltrate them. The state says that I have threatened and forced the peasants to join the marches and that I have financed them. That is a despicable lie."" Megateo also said that ""of course"" he wanted to begin peace talks with the government, as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) are currently doing in Havana, Cuba, despite stating in a communique he released earlier in the month that he "" doesn't believe in the peace process ."" He said his group had sent two petitions to the government to be allowed to join negotiations. SEE ALSO : FARC, Peace and Possible Criminalization During the interview, Megateo revealed information about his criminal structure and operations. He refused to comment on the size of his organization, but called himself a ""regional leader"" and said that the organization ""operates in many areas."" He also admitted to charging a ""war tax"" of slightly over $200 for every kilo of cocaine produced in the region and described his role as that of a regional cocaine broker, but denied involvement in processing and trafficking. Days after the publication of the interview, Colombian forces in conjunction with Interpol reported the arrest of 17 people believed to have connections with Megateo's organization. Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon separately swore that forces would bring down Megateo and the other major criminal players in the region, ""sooner or later."" The EPL maintains a collaborative relationship with Colombia's main guerrilla insurgencies the FARC and the National Liberation Army (ELN) -- which both have a strong presence in Norte de Santander -- and supplies cocaine to criminal organizations such as the Rastrojos. Although Megateo's army is far smaller than that of either of the other guerrilla groups -- in 2012 it was estimated to consist of about 50 fighters -, officials have called him "" the person who leads the parade "" in the region. Megateo is much more than a small time local drug broker. Colombian authorities say he owns large tracts of land in Catatumbo, which are the site of cocaine laboratories that can process up to two tons of cocaine per month. He also is believed to have a support network in border city Cucuta that helps move cocaine from the municipality of Ocana in Norte de Santander into Venezuela. While a kilo of processed cocaine fetches around $2,000 a month in Colombia, that can rise to $4,000 - $6,000 in Venezuela, meaning his organization could be making up to $8 million a month. Megateo became a prime target of Colombian authorities in 2006 after his group ambushed and killed 10 officials from the Department of Administrative Security (DAS) and seven soldiers who were hunting the guerrilla leader in Hacari, Norte de Santander. He has also received blows to his organization, including the arrest in September 2012 of 14 members wanted for extradition to the US on international drug trafficking charges. The kingpin himself has continued to evade capture, something likely linked to the great support he enjoys from locals. Semana likened him to a drug trafficking ""Robin Hood,"" saying he provides area residents with Christmas presents and interest-free loans. An anonymous antinarcotics official told Semana, ""What he has skillfully acquired is great support from the population, going back years."" Official corruption has also worked in Megateo's favor -- according to Semana, he ambushed the 2006 DAS operation thanks to advance warning from corrupt DAS officials, while in 2012 an investigator with the prosecutors office was arrested for ties to the drug lord. When asked, the EPL head said, ""corruption sometimes helps."" According to El Tiempo , Colombian soldiers caught with 300 kilos of cocaine in Magdalena department in May were carrying cocaine belonging to Megateo's organization, indicating that security forces in the area are not just being paid off, but are actively involved in his trade. The release of the interview as Megateo is receiving attention over the protests in Catatumbo raises the question of whether his choice of timing could be related to his desire to join peace talks. The content of the interview also suggests that Megateo is looking to polish his image -- he played down both his status as Catatumbo's main criminal player and a major drug trafficker, saying that the authorities liked to blame him for everything that happened in the region. Participating in peace talks could provide a graceful exit strategy for what remains of the EPL as if the group were to be allowed into talks it would imply recognition of the faction as part of the original rebel force and as a group with political aims, rather than a purely criminal offshoot. This would not be the first time an essentially criminal organization attempted to depict itself as a political actor in Colombia. The original Rastrojos leadership employed a similar strategy, attempting to claim status as a unit of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) in order to gain benefits when the paramilitaries demobilized in a process that ended in 2006. By claiming he is an EPL leader, Megateo maintains at least ostensibly, a ""guerrilla"" status, in contrast to many of those who demobilized in the original EPL peace process. A number of former EPL fighters helped form the Peasant Self Defense Forces of Cordoba and Uraba (ACCU) in the 1990s, and a number of these fighters later formed the core of the Urabenos, a criminal group without any apparent ideological or political aspect. Other EPL alumni include former Rastrojos head Javier Calle Serna, alias ""Comba,"" and Medellin kinpin Diego Murillo, alias ""Don Berna."" The Rastrojo's attempts to claim political status ultimately failed, and Megateo is also unlikely to be allowed a seat at the table in Havana. However his case also serves as a reminder of what may well happen if a deal is struck for the FARC to demobilize. Certain FARC fronts are heavily involved in drug trafficking, and the fragmentation and criminalization of some factions of the guerrillas' organization -- as happened with Megateo's EPL dissidents -- seems likely. In Norte de Santander these elements may even join forces with Megateo's men. Elsewhere in the country, Colombia runs the risk of creating a whole new generation of Megateo style narco-guerrillas."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Brazen Paraguay Vehicle Theft Shows Minotauros Influence from Jail. Despite being jailed in a federal prison in Brazil, an alleged PCC gang leader continues to govern the Brazil-Paraguay border, suggesting that the government is showing no clear signs of wanting to combat organized crime groups head on. Police in Paraguay said that five vehicles, with a value of around $60,000, were seized from a warehouse in the criminally strategic border town of Pedro Juan Caballero. The raid was blamed on Sergio de Arruda Quintiliano Neto, alias ""Minotauro,"" a leader of Brazilian gang, First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC), who was consolidating power and establishing himself as an important crime boss on the Brazil-Paraguay border until his arrest in February. *This article was originally published by ABC Color. It was translated, edited for clarity and reprinted with permission, but does not necessarily reflect the views of InSight Crime. See the original article in Spanish here. The five vehicles that disappeared on February 7, included a red Chevrolet Montana, a silver Hyundai Tucson, a white Chevrolet S10, a white Volkswagen Tiguan and a white Ford Focus. The vehicles, suffering from mechanical problems or lacking parts, had been under police guard in a sealed warehouse. However, not only was the warehouse raided but a crane was used to remove all five vehicles, suggesting that the operation could not have been carried out without the complicity of police forces. Around 20 police officers in Paraguay who had been paid off by the PCC have recently been identified and arrested. Several of Minotauro's gang members have also been identified, but most of whom strikingly still remain free. The aforementioned warehouse was supposedly used by Minotauro and other members from Brazil's PCC -- the country's most powerful organized crime group -- to outfit vehicles with double bottoms to transfer drug shipments, in addition to repainting, modifying and equipping vehicles with armor to shield them from security forces while being used in attacks. Aside from these modifications, the now disappeared vehicles had special value for Minotauro and the PCC as they had recently been used in several of the latest attacks carried out on the Brazil-Paraguay border. Minotauro is currently being held at a federal prison in the Brazilian capital, Brasilia. This does not seem to have stopped his ability to give orders to his collaborators in Pedro Juan Caballero, a town he once supervised through a monitoring center which controlled security cameras at strategic points. *This article was originally published by ABC Color.

"Explosion of Cocaine Labs in Venezuela Points to Production Migration. A record number of drug labs have been dismantled in Venezuela's border region with Colombia, suggesting that Colombian criminal organizations are increasingly using their politically unstable neighbor to process and move cocaine. According to El Nacional , 43 drug labs discovered in the country in 2013 represented an increase of 79 percent on the 24 discovered the previous year. So far this year, 10 labs have been discovered, with all 53 dismantled since the beginning of 2013 found in the border state of Zulia. According to retired coronel Jairo Coronel Figuera, formerly in charge of the Venezuela National Guard's antidrug program, Zulia is a prime cocaine processing location because coca leaves can easily be moved from the nearby Colombian regions of Norte de Santander and Cesar, with chemicals for processing coming from Venezuelan cities. The labs recently dismantled are far more sophisticated than those discovered previously, which were mostly sheds to process and store unrefined cocaine paste. Mildred Camero, ex-president of Venezuela's National Commission Against the Use of Illicit Drugs (Conacuid), told El Nacional the new labs are processing cocaine hydrochloride, or fully refined powder cocaine. The near-doubling of cocaine labs discovered inside Venezuela's borders suggest that drug traffickers may be taking advantage of the country's growing political instability. With protests and unrest in major cities drawing the attention of security forces, the government's ability to effectively monitor outer regions has likely been stretched. Colombian guerilla forces and criminal organizations known as BACRIM (from ""bandas criminales,"" or criminal bands) have long maintained a presence in the border regions of Venezuela. But now it seems their activities may be growing in the face of a corrupt and inadequate security presence incapable of addressing the situation -- standing in stark contrast to Colombia's relatively well-equipped and effective security forces. Venezuela is also a key trafficking route for cocaine moved to Central America and Western Africa , so shifting production to its borders brings the product closer to export points. While the operations to dismantle the labs do show that Venezuela is achieving some level of enforcement, the increase in facilities suggests President Nicolas Maduro's border control strategies -- including a multi-agency force made up of civil and state actors -- are not addressing the situation effectively."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Venezuela to Send 15,000 Soldiers to Fight Armed Groups on Borders. Venezuela's defense minister announced plans to post 15,000 troops to fight drug trafficking and armed groups on the borders with Colombia, Brazil and Guyana, in a speech following the murder of two soldiers on the Colombian border. Defense Minister Henry Rangel Silva said that 2,000 troops were sent to the western state of Tachira, next to Colombia, after the murder of two soldiers there on March 10. The troops are charged with carrying out intelligence work, as part of the ongoing ""Operacion Centinela"" (Operation Sentinel), which aims to reinforce border security. Rangel announced the deployment on a visit to Rubio, in Tachira. He said that another 13,000 soldiers would be deployed to other parts of Venezuela's borders. He also said that 17 people had been arrested in connection with the murders, 14 of them Colombian, and three Venezuelan. There are various armed groups present on the country's 2,000 km border with Colombia, including Colombian rebel groups the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ), the National Liberation Army ( ELN ), and the Urabenos drug gang. The frontier is a key point for cocaine trafficking; as InSight Crime has noted , Venezuela has become the principal transit point for Colombian cocaine, with an estimated 200 tons moving through the country each year. It is not known why the soldiers were killed. Rangel said the deaths did not take place during an army confrontation with armed groups, and that the dead men were dressed in civilian clothes. One of those arrested over the case has been identified as Colombian national Edgardo Andrade Dussan Carvajal, alias ""Tato,"" who Rangel said was a known drug trafficker. One Venezuelan congressman has claimed that the soldiers were killed by the ELN. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Whats Behind the Killings of Mexicos Mayors?Cartel killings of mayors in Mexico have reached record numbers, but the motivations behind them are not as simple as ""plata o plomo,"" meaning silver or lead -- a choice between receiving money or bullets. Thirty-seven mayors, former mayors, and mayoral candidates were killed in 2018, a record high and two more than the previous year, according to a recent report. Researchers at Rice University analyzed these killings and found that the systematic targeting of local officials began in 2004 and have increased steadily over the next 14 years. From July 2004 to March 2018, of the killings with an identifiable cause, half of them were attributed to organized crime. Former mayors were almost as twice as likely to be killed as incumbent ones. Mayors of smaller municipalities were also more vulnerable, with 53 percent of the killings occurring in municipalities with 20,000 residents or less. The consequences for crossing the cartels also seem to be becoming more immediate. Earlier this year, a mayor in Oaxaca was killed less than two hours after taking office. The government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has announced that a division of the new National Guard will focus on protecting government officials and facilities. The motivations behind the killings of mayors are diverse, from the silencing of those who have tried to combat the criminal groups, to retaliation against those with cartel connections, to the pressuring of small town mayors to provide criminal groups free rein and key information. The mayor of Tiquicheo in Michoacan survived two assassination attempts in 2009 after speaking out against organized crime. In 2012, she was kidnapped in broad daylight by cartel members and her body was later found dumped in a rural community. The geographic distribution of the assassinations is also important for understanding the evolving criminal dynamics in Mexico. Since President Felipe Calderon initiated his war on drugs in 2006, the large cartels have fragmented. ""This has led to more organizations that are highly violent and highly flexible,"" David Perez Esparza, writer of the Rice University Report and now head of Mexico's National Information Center, told InSight Crime. He added that a number of factors have contributed to a shift in cartel strategy that has fueled the targeting of local officials. The legalization of marijuana in many US states and the increased popularity of fentanyl has decreased the profitability of trafficking heroin and cannabis. This has led to a greater focus on locally based criminal economies, such as oil theft, extortion and other criminal activities that require control of smaller amounts of territory, according to Perez Esparza. Mayors serve as sources of knowledge that cartels can mine in pursuit of their illicit activities. They are often deeply knowledgeable about a municipality, including infrastructure projects, natural resources and wealthy businessmen that could be targeted for extortion. They also have details of upcoming federal police and army operations, as well as knowledge of which criminal groups are dominant within an area. In smaller municipalities mayors are especially vulnerable to being killed for refusing to cooperate with cartels. ""In rural areas, mayors are reliant [for their safety] on police that often do not work properly, making them easier to target,"" said Perez Esparza. Their murders also attract less attention than that of mayors in more populous areas. Fearing death, some mayors choose to opt to work alongside the cartels, although this too puts them at risk. Officials have also been targeted by criminal groups for real or alleged links to rival organizations. Mexico's mayors have been tied to cartels on multiple occasions. In one notable operation, ten mayors were arrested by federal police for providing information and protection to La Familia Michoacana cartel. ""Public suspicion of mayors after they are killed is high and some citizens assume that their deaths are a result of involvement in organized crime. This diminishes public outcry and calls for thorough investigations,"" Helden De Paz Mancera, another writer on the report, told InSight Crime. ""For citizens suffering from high levels of violence themselves, there is little incentive to demand protection for politicians that they view as corrupt."" Finally, the killing of mayors is also a way for the cartels to show their power or send a message. Mayors have been killed mere days or hours after taking office, demonstrating the ability of the cartels to target politicians at will. In January 2016, cartel hitmen killed Gisela Mota in her house in front of her family mere hours after she was sworn into office. Her killing was likely meant to send a signal to other mayors in the state of Morelos, 13 of whom had already been threatened by Los Rojos, the group responsible for the murder."	0	1	0	1	0	0	0
"115 Peru Candidates Tied to Drug Trafficking: Minister. Well over 100 political candidates in Peru have been linked to drug trafficking cases, highlighting the heightened risk of criminal infiltration in the government of the world's largest cocaine producer. According to Interior Minister Daniel Urresti, Peru's anti-drug police have identified at least 115 candidates for municipal and regional government positions with ties to drug trafficking cases, reported La Republica. Urresti said that while these candidates have previously been investigated for ties to the drug trade, they have not necessarily been convicted. ""We're not saying they are drug traffickers, but we believe citizens have the right to know,"" he stated. Urresti said he would give the list of candidates to the country's national electoral authority (JNE), which would take the necessary measures to prevent drug traffickers from infiltrating the upcoming October 5 elections. The Interior Ministry is also compiling a list of candidates with ties to illegal mining, reported El Comercio. Meanwhile, Congressman Jose Leon Rivera has announced a proposal to amend an exiting law on political parties so that parties who either sponsor candidates with ties to drug trafficking, or accept campaign financing from criminal groups, would be banned from participating in elections. Numerous Peruvian politicians have been implicated in criminal activity , including former President Alan Garcia, who has been investigated for allegedly accepting bribes from drug traffickers in exchange for granting official pardons. In 2013 alone, nineteen politicians -- including three governors and five members of Congress -- were investigated for ties to the drug trade. Given the fact that Peru is currently the world's largest coca and cocaine producer , it is unsurprising that some political candidates have been tied to drug trafficking. What is troubling, however, is that more than 100 politicians believe they have a shot at getting elected in spite of reported ties to the drug trade -- a figure that points to a culture of impunity among the country's political elite. The extent of alleged criminal infiltration in Peruvian politics is reminiscent of Colombia in the 1980s and 1990s. In the most glaring examples of this phenomenon, notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar was elected to the House of Representatives in 1982, and President Ernesto Samper (1994-98) allegedly accepted an estimated $6 million in campaign contributions from the Cali Cartel. While Interior Minister Urresti has taken steps towards exposing candidates with alleged criminal ties, making lists of names will likely do little to keep drug trafficking separate from politics unless his efforts are accompanied by tougher laws and a stronger judicial system."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"What Should Be Done to Reduce Crime in Venezuela?Since 2008 the Chavez and now Maduro governments have increasingly taken on the issue of crime, often in quite contradictory ways. Here we look at if and how these strategies resonate with citizens' opinions. To do so we added a question to Datanalisis' July-August Omnibus survey that asked respondents what they thought would reduce crime. The question provided respondents with a list of measures (improving the values taught to children by the family; decreasing poverty and social inequality; professionalizing police officers; reforming the judicial and penal systems; a permanent deployment of military in sectors with high rates of crime; improving access to sports and cultural activities; and improving access to public space) and asked them to rank the three most important in fighting crime. This article originally appeared on the Washington Office on Latin America blog Venezuela Politics and Human Rights. See original article here. The first part of this series can be seen here. The first table presents the percentage of number one responses each measure received. These results are consistent with those we described in our first post. Family values was the most common first choice for reducing crime with almost 30 percent naming it. Indeed 67 percent of respondents mentioned it among their top three (see below). As we mentioned before, pointing to the family effectively privatizes and depoliticizes crime. But it also heavily genders it. In the Venezuelan context ""the family"" often boils down to single mothers who are portrayed as ""not doing their jobs."" Such mothers are often referred to as ""alcahuetas,"" a label that specifically refers to women who cover up or ignore the bad behavior of their sons. While over 50 percent of respondents thought that crime would best be addressed by addressing social and cultural causes, it is notable that over 30 percent of respondents saw reforms in police, penal and judicial systems as the most important actions that could be taken to fight crime. This compared to only 12.3 percent that saw military deployment-- the Maduro government's favored strategy --as the most effective way to reduce crime. The second table, which aggregates all mentions, supports these trends. While improving family values is the most common choice, ""professionalization of police"" is the second most commonly mentioned response, even surpassing ""decreasing poverty and social inequality."" Indeed over half of the respondents chose this among their top three. Thus, while average Venezuelans do not seem to think police corruption or inefficiency are major causes of crime , they do seem to believe that a professional police force and improved judicial and penal system could reduce crime. Of course, it is unclear as to what respondents have in mind when they chose ""professionalize the police."" While some might be thinking about improved police training and supervision, others surely are thinking about better weapons, vehicles, and technology (we will address this issue in a future post). According to these numbers there is significant support for military deployment as a means for reducing crime. 40 percent of respondents included it in their top three choices. However, anyway you cut it, there is significantly more support for citizen security reform. *This article originally appeared on the Washington Office on Latin America blog Venezuela Politics and Human Rights.

"Informants Shed Light on Structure of MS13 in Guatemala. Former MS13 members in Guatemala have provided a breakdown of the rankings and pay scales within the gang's hierarchy, which serve as another indication of this organization's increasingly sophisticated structure. Five Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) members-turned-informants told Public Ministry officials that orders were given by a central group of leaders known as the Council of Nine, many of whom are in prison, reported Prensa Libre. The second level of the hierarchy are the heads of the gang ""clicas"" -- cliques, or cells -- operating in specific neighborhoods, who are paid nearly $2,000 a week and answer directly to the Council of Nine. Then come those charged with handling financial affairs and carrying out specialized operations -- such as police killings -- who make just under $200 a week. Next are the hired assassins, who receive about $65 per victim and are also responsible for collecting extortion debts. The lowest ranking members carry out extortion attempts and perform menial tasks, such as grocery shopping. They receive less than $40 a week, as can be seen in the infographic below. The informants also said the MS13 operated principally in three zones of Guatemala city, three outlying areas, and a city in the Quetzaltenango province. The Public Ministry reportedly plans to use the information in the case against 93 gang members accused of murder, extortion and attacks. The information revealed by the gang informants provides further insight into the MS13 gang hierarchy in Guatemala and how different jobs within the organization are valued. The pay scales are also a reminder of the financial motivation for impoverished youths to join a gang and work to gain the respect necessary to move up the ranks. What remains unclear is whether the money earned from the activities of lower ranking members is funneled to the top leadership or retained by clica leaders. Conceptualizing Guatemala's MS13 as a hierarchical organization run by a central council is not new. A 2013 investigation by Mexican newspaper El Universal revealed that formerly disparate clicas were becoming more centrally organized and that the Council of Nine -- contrary to its name -- had grown to 37 members. MS13 rival Barrio 18 has a similar council called the ""Wheel of the Barrio."" This seemingly formalized structure is just one indication of the MS13's apparently growing sophistication in Guatemala, as well as in neighboring Honduras and El Salvador. Other signs of this have included the discovery of highly sophisticated weaponry belonging to MS13 members. The perceived threat posed by the MS13 was highlighted by the United States labeling it a transnational criminal organization in 2013. Some observers have said that the (now defunct) MS13-Barrio 18 gang truce in El Salvador facilitated the expansion of the gangs, and gave them the space needed to organize themselves more efficiently. It's possible that there may have been something of a spillover effect in Guatemala, particularly given that the maras maintain contact across national borders ."	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
"Colombian Govt Busts FARC, ERPAC Cocaine Lab. In what is becoming an increasing trend, Colombia authorities discovered a cocaine-processing laboratory in the eastern plains of the country, which they said was run by right-wing paramilitaries and left-wing guerrillas. El Espectador reports that the lab, which was located in Acacia, Meta, was run by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia's ( FARC ) 53rd Front and members of the Popular Revolutionary Anti-Terrorist Army of Colombia ( ERPAC ). Authorities found 1.5 tons of processed cocaine, which they valued at $100,000, and said the lab had the capacity to produce two tons per month. The FARC, and the smaller rebel group the National Liberation Army ( ELN ), have been aligning themselves with former right-wing paramilitary groups like the ERPAC to form production and distribution chains for drugs. The alliances between old enemies represent the short- and, possibly, long-term future of drug trafficking in Colombia, especially given the Colombian government's recent success in killing and capturing top level leaders of these organizations. In the latest blow to the FARC, last week Colombian forces killed its top leader , Guillermo Leon Saenz, alias "" Alfonso Cano ."" The resulting fragmentation that follows these government efforts has made for strange bedfellows in the Colombian underworld. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Violence Spikes Ahead of Mexicos Midterm Elections. Another political candidate has been murdered as Mexico continues to register violence ahead of upcoming midterm elections, with unrest concentrated in regions infiltrated by organized crime. On June 2, armed men entered and attacked Miguel Angel Luna Munguia -- a congressional candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) -- at his campaign headquarters in Valle de Chalco, reported El Pais. He was reported dead on arrival after being taken to a nearby hospital. A former mayor of Valle de Chalco -- a town of about 350,000 residents located in Mexico state on the outskirts of Mexico City -- Luna Munguia is the fourth political candidate assassinated ahead of Mexico's midterm elections on June 7. Two mayoral candidates in the state of Guerrero and one in Michoacan have been killed since March. According to El Pais, pre-election violence has seen a total of 70 incidents and 19 political assassinations throughout Mexico. There have been incidents of apparent political unrest as well. On June 1, the electoral offices in Tlapa, Guerrero were attacked by unknown persons and over 116,000 electoral ballots burned. The attack followed similar episodes in the state of Oaxaca, where, according to El Universal , 16,000 ballots were destroyed -- reportedly by teachers protesting educational reforms. Pre-electoral violence -- including attacks against offices of the National Electoral Institute (INE) with Molotov cocktails -- has also occurred in the states of Puebla, Veracruz, Yucatan, Jalisco, Michoacan, and San Luis Potosi, reported El Universal. Violence ahead of Mexico's midterm elections -- when ballots will be cast for nearly 300 mayoral seats, nine governorships, and all 500 seats in Mexico's lower house of Congress -- has been especially concentrated in regions like Guerrero , where organized crime groups Los Rojos and Los Ardillos have been locked in a power struggle. On May 1, Fabian Quiroz Garcia, a mayoral candidate in the Guerrero town of Chilapa, was murdered while campaigning. Nonetheless, pre-election violence is not a new phenomenon in Mexico, and political candidates have been known to withdraw their candidacies out of fear of violence and assassination. As InSight Crime has previously noted , Mexican organized crime groups -- seeking collaboration with local authorities in order to facilitate their illegal activities -- have an interest in influencing electoral outcomes. This may explain why, on June 2, a new video began circulating online showing Servando Gomez, alias ""La Tuta"" -- the former leader of the Knights Templar criminal group -- discussing how he has helped Michoacan politicians. While La Tuta has been in custody since February, the release of the video seems intended to call attention to links between Michoacan political elites and organized crime just before voters cast their ballots."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Crime Groups Persist in Guatemalas Customs System: Defense Minister. Guatemala's Defense Minister has denounced that criminal groups continue to infiltrate the country's customs system, suggesting that deeper structural reforms are needed to combat corruption within this institution. On August 1, Guatemala's Defense Minister Williams Mansilla admitted that criminal groups ""persist"" in the country's customs institutions and that greater inter-institutional coordination is essential in tackling this issue, EFE reported. During a meeting on the topic attended by Mansilla and opposition politicians, various issues within the country's ports were identified. These included deficiencies in security and merchandise control, and the passage of containers carrying drugs and weapons. The most affected port discussed was that of Santo Tomas de Castilla, a key facility on Guatemala's Caribbean coast with a direct connection to the country's main market, the United States. Vice Minister of the Interior Anibal Guzman explained that the police units operating in the country's ports are insufficient, and announced that 100 more officers would soon be added to improve security, EFE reported. The head of Guatemala's customs authority (Superintendencia de Administracion Tributaria - SAT) Juan Francisco Solorzano explained that despite the entity's requests that ports tighten controls over their operations, only 70 percent of requirements have been met so far. According to the SAT, 14 of Guatemala's 17 customs operate below the targeted collection amount due to corruption, among other factors. As reported in April this year , the SAT has proposed reforms to Guatemala's law against fraud and contraband as well as Central America's customs code. The body has also requested the creation of a special security force unit against contraband and customs fraud. ""Customs fraud can only be tackled with a multi-sector force and legal reforms,"" SAT superintendent Werner Florencio Ovalle told Prensa Libre at the time. The persistence of corruption in Guatemala's customs system despite several high-profile arrests -- including those of former President Otto Perez Molina and Vice President Roxana Baldetti -- suggests that more structural reforms are needed to help undercut criminal influence in this institution. Authorities' current concerns address several different types of criminal activity within the country's imports and exports system. One is customs fraud, the type of corruption characterized by the notorious case of La Linea , in which then-President Perez Molina allegedly headed a criminal system by which import taxes were lowered in exchange for kickbacks. Allegations later emerged that those implicated in the La Linea were still wielding control over their criminal networks from prison. This scheme is different from the widespread and ongoing corruption that affects many ports in Latin America, by which criminal groups bribe officials to provide them with information on ship routes, arrival dates and types of cargo to help facilitate contraband smuggling. Uprooting both types of criminal collusion will require deep structural changes, that go beyond increasing personnel to ensuring that those officials are not corroded by criminal interests."	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"Did Sean Penns Meeting With El Chapo Help Authorities Track Down the Kingpin?When Mexican authorities captured Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman in January 2016, they suggested that their success stemmed in part from an October 2015 meeting the kingpin held with Hollywood star Sean Penn and Mexican actress Kate del Castillo. Now, extensive reporting by InSight Crime combined with evidence presented in a new documentary film series has called into question details of various narratives surrounding these events. At least one person close to this case believes that Penn's legal team may have tipped off US authorities about the planned meeting with El Chapo, potentially allowing the United States to inform its Mexican partners, who are known to have surveilled Penn and others in Mexico around the time of the meeting. In a statement to InSight Crime, a spokesperson for Penn strongly denied that this was the case. However, knowledgeable sources consulted by InSight Crime suggested that whether or not such a tip-off occurred, it is likely that El Chapo's meeting with Penn and del Castillo was indeed an important element of the hunt for one of the most powerful drug barons the world has ever known. Additionally, InSight Crime has obtained documents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that contain reports apparently derived from press accounts indicating that Penn met with one of El Chapo's children on Venezuela's Margarita Island prior to meeting El Chapo himself, and that Venezuelan authorities offered ""protection"" for this meeting. Penn has not previously commented in public on these reports, which were not widely circulated, and despite repeated attempts, the actor's representatives declined to address them on the record. (El Chapo's legal team also declined requests for comment for this article.) Nevertheless, the DHS documents and other circumstantial evidence lend plausibility to this little-discussed but potentially significant aspect of the story. The Documents InSight Crime obtained the documents from DHS through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). They are heavily redacted, and Penn's name does not actually appear in them. But they do contain details that closely match previously reported information about Penn's and del Castillo's contacts with El Chapo. For instance, a section of the documents dated January 12, 2016, references the publication of photographs of an ""actress"" who ""brought [redacted] together."" This seems to refer to photographs of Penn and del Castillo that were reportedly taken by Mexican intelligence agents at the time of the meeting with El Chapo and were published in the Mexican press shortly after the kingpin's January 2016 arrest. Del Castillo's name does not appear in the DHS documents, either. And the photographs are extremely grainy, with the subjects' faces redacted, making them essentially inscrutable. But del Castillo's legal representative Harland Braun told InSight Crime that he suspects the documents do in fact refer to his client and Penn. ""I would think the 'actors and producers' [mentioned in the documents] refers to my client, Sean Penn and the other actors and producers,"" Braun said. (Excerpt from DHS documents obtained by InSight Crime) The Meeting According to Penn's own account -- published in Rolling Stone magazine the day after El Chapo's 2016 arrest, and publicly criticized by many at the time, including InSight Crime Co-director Steven Dudley -- del Castillo played a key part in facilitating the meeting with El Chapo. El Chapo first contacted del Castillo through a lawyer after she posted a message on her Twitter account in 2012 addressed to the Sinaloa Cartel kingpin, who was a free man at the time following his first escape from a Mexican prison in 2001. ""Today I believe more in El Chapo Guzman than I do in the governments that hide truths from me, even if they are painful,"" the tweet read, in part. ""Mr. Chapo, wouldn't it be cool if you started trafficking with the good? Come on, senor, you would be the hero of heroes."" Del Castillo starred in the popular 2011 Mexican soap opera series "" The Queen of the South ,"" which follows the fictional story of a woman from El Chapo's home state of Sinaloa who moves to Spain and becomes an international drug dealer. The show is loosely based on a real-life convicted drug trafficker named Sandra Avila Beltran. According to El Chapo's lawyer Andres Granados, who was interviewed in a new Netflix series produced by del Castillo called "" The Day I Met El Chapo ,"" the Sinaloa Cartel boss became a big fan of del Castillo's work, so much so that he eventually gave her the exclusive rights to produce a film about him. In the series, del Castillo describes how she and El Chapo stayed in touch through intermediaries even after the drug lord's arrest in 2014. At the time, del Castillo was involved in talks about the film project, and came into contact with Penn through a mutual acquaintance in Los Angeles, Argentine-born producer Fernando Sulichin. After El Chapo's sensational escape from prison in July 2015, Penn wrote in the Rolling Stone article that he reached out to Sulichin, who told him that El Chapo and del Castillo had been in contact following the prison break. Penn then proposed to do a magazine story on El Chapo, and the mutual friend put him in touch with del Castillo, who helped set up the meeting, which took place in early October 2015. In her Netflix series and in previous interviews with the New Yorker and LA Weekly , del Castillo has given an account of the machinations behind the El Chapo meeting that essentially matches the version told by Penn in his Rolling Stone article. However, in the Netflix series she says that Penn's article contains some ""lies."" For instance, she says that she never received flowers from El Chapo, as the article states, and she also denies that she and Penn passed through a Mexican military checkpoint on the way to meet the drug boss. Del Castillo also differs with Penn on a crucial detail: namely, she disputes the actor's claims that he was clear about his intentions regarding the El Chapo visit. (The filmmakers say Penn did not respond to their requests for comment.) While Penn insisted in a statement to the New Yorker last year that the trip ""was embarked upon with total transparency and full knowledge of our collective interests,"" del Castillo says Penn misled her to believe that he was trying to help her move her film project forward, and that Penn did not mention his plan to write the Rolling Stone article until they were already meeting with El Chapo. In the Netflix series, a friend of del Castillo's called Penn's actions a ""betrayal."" A former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in the Netflix series said the actress had been ""duped."" The Arrest Days after the meeting with Penn and del Castillo, Mexican Marines mounted an operation to capture El Chapo at his suspected hideout in Sinaloa. Although Penn has previously denied that his visit with the crime boss had anything to do with his arrest, del Castillo says in the Netflix series that Penn told her he believed that the raid was linked to their visit. Del Castillo says she thinks it's possible. ""But really,"" she adds, ""I don't know."" The October 2015 capture attempt failed, but the drug lord was arrested by Mexican authorities several months later, on January 8, 2016. In a January 11, 2016, radio interview, Mexico's then-Attorney General Arely Gomez said the meeting with Penn and del Castillo was an "" essential element "" in the hunt for El Chapo ""because we were following [El Chapo's] lawyer, and the lawyer took us to these people and to this meeting."" A few days later, Penn rejected that statement in an interview with CBS's ""60 Minutes,"" in which he described as a ""myth"" the idea that his meeting with El Chapo had helped Mexican authorities to track down the drug boss. Interviewer Charlie Rose pressed him: ""So as far as you know, you had nothing to do and your visit had nothing to do with his recapture?"" ""Here's the things that we know: We know that the Mexican government they were clearly very humiliated by the notion that someone found him before they did,"" Penn responded. ""Well, nobody found him before they did. We didn't -- we're not smarter than the DEA or the Mexican intelligence. We had a contact upon which we were able to facilitate an invitation."" Penn's statements to ""60 Minutes"" are somewhat vague, but in his own Rolling Stone account of the meeting with El Chapo he said he was sure he was being surveilled. In the article, Penn wrote that at the time of the visit to El Chapo's hideout, there was ""no question in my mind but that the DEA and the Mexican government [were] tracking our movements."" InSight Crime did not receive a response to repeated requests to the Mexican Attorney General's Office to comment on whether it stands by the statements made by Gomez, who was replaced as attorney general by Raul Cervantes Andrade in October 2016. Shortly after El Chapo's arrest, Gomez announced that the Attorney General's Office had opened an investigation into whether Penn and del Castillo broke Mexican law during the course of their visit with El Chapo. In response to an inquiry from the Associated Press, Penn said he had ""nothin' to hide."" Del Castillo declined to comment. On January 11, 2016, the New York Post reported that then-US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara had also opened an investigation of Penn's contacts with El Chapo. The Southern District declined to comment on the existence or status of the reported probe of Penn. Participants in del Castillo's Netflix series suggest that the Mexican investigation of her is an attempt at retribution for her past criticisms of the government, including figures like first lady Angelica Rivera. No formal charges have been brought against Penn or del Castillo in either country. The Tip Off? One of the most explosive allegations in the new Netflix series centers around the notion that Penn's representatives may have alerted US authorities about the planned visit with El Chapo. Braun, del Castillo's legal representative, told InSight Crime prior to the release of the Netflix series that he suspects Penn's legal team tipped off US law enforcement -- something he also states in the film series. ""My speculation is that Mr. Penn's legal team notified the US government and they in turn notified the Mexican authorities who were able to survey the meeting between Mr. Penn and Mr. Guzman, subsequently leading to his arrest,"" Braun told InSight Crime. ""Mr. Penn's legal team did what lawyers are supposed to do, protect their client. I assume that they were trying to protect Mr. Penn as well as themselves. After they heard he was meeting with the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, I'm sure they notified the authorities,"" Braun said. ""My speculation is that Mr. Penn's legal team notified the US government and they in turn notified the Mexican authorities who were able to survey the meeting between Mr. Penn and Mr. Guzman, subsequently leading to his arrest."" - Harland Braun Comments by an unnamed law enforcement source who spoke to the New York Post around the time of El Chapo's 2016 arrest seem to lend weight to Braun's theory. ""Other people found out about his intentions. It started leaking out, and then Sean Penn came into the mix,"" the source said. ""One thing I can tell you: If Chapo had never met with Penn, he would still be at large."" In a statement provided to InSight Crime, a spokesperson from the Penn camp rejected speculation that someone from Penn's legal team may have tipped off authorities. ""The notion that Mr. Penn or anyone on his behalf alerted DOJ to the trip is a complete fabrication and bald-faced lie. It never happened, nor would there have been any reason for it to have happened,"" the statement says. The statement also implies that del Castillo and those close to her are engaged in an effort of self-promotion. ""It is reprehensible that, in their ongoing, relentless efforts to gain additional attention and publicity, Ms. del Castillo and her team (who have zero firsthand knowledge) have sought to create this profoundly false, foolish, and reckless narrative,"" the statement reads. The Surveillance While it is uncertain whether someone close to Penn may have tipped off US law enforcement about the October 2015 meeting in Mexico, it is clear that surveillance of El Chapo's contacts with Penn and del Castillo played a role in the hunt for the drug boss. Del Castillo, who described herself in the Netflix series as the ""intermediary"" between Penn and El Chapo, turned out to be an important target of government telephone intercepts. Text messages exchanged between El Chapo and del Castillo were scooped up by Mexican authorities and eventually leaked to the newspaper Milenio. (In the Netflix series, del Castillo and some close to her allege that the government manipulated the content of the messages in an attempt to smear her reputation.) Whether or not similar surveillance was conducted specifically on Penn by either Mexican or US authorities remains uncertain. However, Mike Vigil, the former Chief of International Operations at the DEA, told InSight Crime that the now-famous meeting was the ""catalyst"" for El Chapo ""taking a hit."" ""In a way you can say that it did lead to his downfall,"" Vigil said. ""After his meeting with Penn and del Castillo [El Chapo] became even more enamored with her, and as a result of that, he started communicating with her by telephone."" Mark Schnapp, the former head of the criminal division at the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, also linked El Chapo's capture to his sloppiness when it came to his electronic communication practices. ""Let's face it. Unlike last time, when he was a fugitive for more than a decade, this time he got cocky and careless with a lot of people, including apparently with Ms. del Castillo,"" Schnapp told InSight Crime. Other former US officials pointed out that the meeting was just one element of a vast operation to track down El Chapo following his July 2015 prison break. Peter Vincent, a former high-ranking official with the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, downplayed the role of the meeting in comments to InSight Crime. ""This was an international manhunt, involving literally hundreds of pieces of leads the Mexican Marines were following, including security and informants close to Mr. Guzman having nothing to do with the group that included Ms. del Castillo and Mr. Penn,"" he said. Thomas Cash, a former high-ranking official with the DEA in Miami, went even further than Vincent, implying the meeting was completely insignificant. ""The notion that Mr. Penn or his group were even relevant to finding El Chapo is completely absurd, and candidly, if Mr. Penn weren't famous he wouldn't be singled out, and we wouldn't be having this discussion,"" Cash wrote in an email to InSight Crime. The Venezuela Connection The DHS documents obtained by InSight Crime suggest that US authorities, like their Mexican counterparts, were also interested in how the famous actors came to meet with one of the world's most wanted criminals. The documents reference a previously reported -- but largely ignored -- aspect of the story of Penn's journey to meet El Chapo: allegations that the actor traveled to Venezuela's Margarita Island shortly ahead of the visit with the drug boss to meet with ""at least one of [his] children."" The Spanish news outlet ABC published an article about the alleged Venezuela trip on January 11, 2016, days after El Chapo had been re-arrested. The DHS documents contain what appears to be an English summary of the ABC report accompanied by the same picture that accompanied the original article. (The picture in the DHS documents is grainy and redacted, but it is possible to make out the resemblance.) (Top: Screenshot of original ABC article. Bottom: Photo excerpted from DHS documents) ABC reported that the meeting between Penn and El Chapo's son(s) was ""apparently"" conducted under the ""protection"" of Hugo Carvajal, a current congressman in Venezuela who served as Director of Military Intelligence between 2004 and 2011. Carvajal was sanctioned in 2008 by the United States for allegedly supporting the drug trafficking activities of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). He is suspected of belonging to the corrupt drug trafficking networks within the Venezuelan military known as the Cartel of the Suns. Although the DHS documents appear to be derived from ABC's thinly-sourced report, other evidence lends credibility to the notion that Venezuelan officials might have helped facilitate Penn's meeting with El Chapo. Penn has well-established ties with the Venezuelan government. He first met then-President Hugo Chavez during a 2007 trip to Venezuela, and remained a staunch defender of Chavez until the leader's death in 2013. The Venezuelan government, particularly under Chavez's hand-picked successor Nicolas Maduro, has strongly backed and at times even promoted several high-level officials accused of involvement in the drug trade, including Carvajal , Interior Minister Nestor Reverol and Vice President Tareck El Aissami. According to ABC, DEA sources claimed that El Chapo himself had traveled to Venezuela previously and may have been in the country in August or September 2015, shortly before the encounter between Penn and one of his children. However, El Chapo was reportedly seen in many different countries following his prison break earlier that year, some as far away as Europe, raising questions about the veracity of the supposed Venezuela sighting. Nevertheless, while direct links between El Chapo and Venezuelan officials have not been established, Mexican drug trafficking organizations are known to have ties to Venezuelan crime networks. For instance, a Sinaloa Cartel operative turned DEA informant was apparently a key point of contact for two nephews of Venezuela's first lady Cilia Flores who were convicted last year of drug charges in US federal court. And members of Venezuela's military have been accused of working with Mexican drug trafficking groups in the past. For example, Walid Makled, a convicted drug trafficker who worked with the Cartel of the Suns, alleged that several drug flights left the state of Apure in Venezuela each day, and that their cargo was ultimately destined for Mexican trafficking groups to transport to the United States. The ABC report about Penn's supposed visit to Margarita Island remains unconfirmed by independent sources. (The actor's spokesperson declined to comment on this aspect of the story.) But if Venezuelan officials did help facilitate a meeting between Penn and one of El Chapo's sons, it was more likely as a favor to Penn in return for his long-time defense of Venezuela's controversial government, rather than as a move to flatter or appease the Sinaloa Cartel kingpin. According to Braun, del Castillo knew nothing about Penn's supposed trip to Venezuela. ""We have absolutely no knowledge of this meeting in Venezuela,"" he said. ""However, if it proves to be true, that would tell me that Mr. Penn was going behind my client's back."" A Hollywood Ending After nearly a year of legal wrangling, El Chapo was extradited to the United States in January 2017. He is currently facing trial for numerous drug and organized crime-related charges in a federal court in New York. If convicted, he could serve a life sentence. Meanwhile, the drug kingpin's infamy has spawned a slew of entertainment ventures -- some of them spurious -- based on his image. A drama series produced by Univision and Netflix, simply titled ""El Chapo,"" premiered on the television network on April 23, and was later released on the internet streaming service. Reports also indicate that Sony Pictures has obtained the rights to produce a film based on a book by a pseudonymous DEA agent and a Canadian journalist titled, ""Hunting El Chapo: The Thrilling Inside Story of the American Lawman Who Captured the World's Most-Wanted Drug Lord."" Big-budget director Michael Bay is reportedly in talks about the project. That movie is set to compete with an adaptation of novelist Don Winslow's fictionalized version of El Chapo's story, ""The Cartel,"" which is being produced by 20th Century Fox. Award-winning director Ridley Scott is reportedly attached to the film. And del Castillo said recently that she too wants to follow through on her plans to make a movie about the infamous drug lord. ""I want to be the one who brings forward a story that concerns everyone,"" she says near the end of her Netflix series. ""It would be incredibly important for my career. And for me, personally, as a Mexican. Talking about organized crime in Mexico is important to me."" As for Penn, it is unclear whether he is planning to be involved in any future media projects related to El Chapo."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Tip of the Iceberg: Former El Salvador Presidential Candidate Accused of Negotiating with Gangs. The top prosecutor in El Salvador has asked congress to strip immunity from a legislator he says negotiated with gangs for political benefit during the 2014 presidential election. Norman Quijano, a current congressman who ran for president in 2014 and was mayor of the capital city, San Salvador, has been accused of conspiracy and electoral fraud -- the first time such a high-level official faces potential charges for making secret deals with street gangs. Attorney General Raul Melara announced his decision on January 27 in a morning address. That afternoon, he sent prosecutors to the Legislative Assembly to present Quijano with a summons, according to La Prensa Grafica. The investigation into Quijano formally began when a gang member, identified as ""Noe,"" implicated him in testimony during a court case where 400 members of the MS13 were being collectively tried. Noe said in court that several gang leaders met with Quijano during the 2014 presidential election. Quijano ran as a candidate for the Nationalist Republican Alliance (Alianza Republicana Nacionalista - ARENA), the rightist party that governed El Salvador between 1989 and 2009 and currently governs the capital city. He ended up losing the election by just over 6,000 votes. In the case where Noe was a witness, prosecutors presented several videos as evidence. In one of these, Quijano appears in a meeting with gang members, El Faro reported. Part of the video, however, was kept out of court by the judge because it showed the face of a protected witness. The investigative outlet, however, obtained transcripts of that conversation, in which the former presidential candidate offers to invest public funds in rehabilitation programs in exchange for the gang leaders' influence in the areas under their control. More specifically, Quijano offered to provide up to $100,000 for rehabilitation programs from supposedly national party funds. In return he said: ""We can do it if you actually vote for ARENA. If you all give us the opportunity to govern,"" according to El Faro. After the accusations against Quijano were announced , he said he was innocent in a statement on his Twitter account, something that he has done before. ""I repeat that I have not given any money to delinquents, let alone agreed to benefits,"" he wrote. Quijano later tweeted another statement, in which he said he was a victim of a political conspiracy. According to Salvadoran law, it is now up to the representatives to form a special commission for the preliminary hearing to determine if there is cause to take away Quijano's immunity. The decision to strip his immunity only requires a simple majority in the legislature -- 43 of 84 votes. The accusations by El Salvador's attorney general against Norman Quijano represent a sea change in how high-level officials are dealt with for attempting to negotiate with gangs. In 2016, Douglas Melendez, the lawyer that preceded Melara as attorney general , prosecuted 19 people involved in the truce -- negotiated in 2012 between the MS13 and Barrio 18 -- for conspiring with criminal groups and introducing contraband into the jails. Among those charged were police , anti-gang , and jail officials, as well as one of the truce's chief negotiators. B ut a judge later dismissed the case against them, saying that the evidence against them was insufficient, and some had been acting under orders from their superiors. Melendez, however, stopped short of accusing David Munguia Payes, the minister of security and defense during the administration of Mauricio Funes (2009-2014), of any wrongdoing, despite testimony that pointed to Munguia Payes as the primary architect of the truce, which allowed for a temporary decline in homicides by gang members in exchange for their incarcerated leaders receiving benefits. Munguia has said that Funes was aware of everything related to the pact with the gangs. The judge who dismissed the case against the officials criticized the Attorney General's Office for not investigating the former president and former minister. The Quijano case, though, is just the tip of the iceberg: a number of politicians from various political parties have been outed as having sat down with the gangs. Salvadoran politicians who have allegedly negotiated with gang members include the current mayor of San Salvador, Ernesto Muyshondt , and members of President Nayib Bukele's inner circle , as well as several officials from the leftwing government of former President Salvador Sanchez Ceren. In the case of officials close to Bukele, the alleged agreement with the gangs was reached in February 2015, while the president was still the mayor of San Salvador. An investigation by El Faro into the talks says that Bukele's municipal administration ""made concessions"" to gang members over the course of three years in exchange for not interfering with the administration's projects in the city. An investigation by the Attorney General's Office determined that the Bukele administration sent Mario Duran and Carlos Marroquin to meet with two MS13 spokesmen at a mall in the capital on December 21, 2015, according to a report by Factum. The Salvadoran police even sent undercover agents to observe the meeting, Factum reported. Duran is currently the minister of the interior under President Bukele, and Marroquin is an official within the same agency in charge of social projects in areas under gang control. Meanwhile, Mayor Muyshondt admitted to meeting with gang members in 2015 , saying that he did so to pay the extortion fees that the gangs demanded to let him campaign in the areas under their control. Muyshondt also admitted to paying blackmail with funds from his political party. While politicians from different political parties, including mayors and ministers , have been linked to gang members in court cases and journalistic reports, up until now, no one as high-profile as Quijano has faced possible prosecution. In a country where the primary security problems are all related to the MS13 and Barrio 18 street gangs, that is a game changer.

"Jamaica Gangs Follow Regional Pattern of Recruiting From Schools. Experts say that Jamaican gangs are increasingly trying to enlist high school students in their ranks, a reminder that schools often serve as recruiting grounds for organized crime groups. A recent panel hosted by the Jamaica Gleaner discussed the reasons why many students are susceptible to recruitment by gangs. ""Young boys, in particular, are getting something from being in a gang, which is missing from their home environment. They get respect and they are given purpose,"" said anthropologist and University of the West Indies lecturer Dr. Herbert Gayle. ""When there is a violent incident, perhaps the father and the mother have been killed and the child or children become orphaned, there is nobody,"" said Berthlyn Plummer, a member of a government-established civil society organization known as the Peace Management Initiative. ""After that nine-day wonder when everybody jumps around, the media, that child, or children, is not going to school or goes irregularly. Sometimes they don't have proper living arrangements. The next best thing that comes to them in the community is, perhaps, the gang. The gang leader may provide some breakfast or some dinner,"" Plummer continued. While some students leave school to join the gangs, others have formed gangs inside school grounds. Jamaican police authorities expressed concern about the rise of student gangs across high schools, especially in the divisions of St. Catherine North and South, RJR News reported in December 2016. These student gangs are usually linked to criminal groups operating in the area, and conflicts between rival gangs can play out inside school grounds. According to the Acting Commissioner of Police Novelette Grant, in 2016 Jamaica was home to 258 criminal gangs. Of the 1,350 murders committed in 2016 in the country, 65 percent were linked to these organized crime groups. The National Strategic Anti-Gang Unit carried out operations against 20 gangs in 2016, and 356 members were arrested last year. Schools are known to be recruitment grounds for organized crime groups across Latin America and the Caribbean. Given that youngsters are likely to receive more lenient penalties if caught committing a crime, they provide an attractive form of low-cost, low-risk labor for criminal networks in the region. In Jamaica, youngsters are often employed as ""movers,"" that is, ""persons who move around with illicit items, be it firearms, ammunition, etc.,"" Assistant Commissioner Clifford Chambers told RJR News. Similarly, in Mexico, drug cartels have used children aged between 11 to 17 to traffic illegal narcotics, according to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The younger the recruits, the easier it is to manipulate them. Gangs in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula have been known to recruit kindergartners and threaten children who refuse to join their ranks. In El Salvador, the number of children dropping out of school due to gang threats increased threefold from 13,000 in 2014 to 39,000 in 2015. Nonetheless, as reflected by Dr. Gayle's comments, working for crime groups is still seen as a conduit for a higher social status, given that illegal groups often offer children a sense of self worth as well as physical and material security that their families cannot provide."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Microtrafficking Grows, New Drug Routes Emerge in Argentina. Microtrafficking is on the rise in Argentina, according to a new report. New trends are impacting the trafficking landscape, but also raise questions over the right policies to tackle the issue. The study by the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina (Universidad Catolica Argentina - UCA) shows that microtrafficking has constantly increased from 2010 to 2016. Nearly half of surveyed Argentinians said they witnessed drug trafficking activities in their neighborhood during 2016, compared to barely 30 percent of respondents in 2010. The highest rates of microtrafficking were reported in the urban centers of the Pampas region, and those of the Northwestern region (Noroeste Argentino - NOA), according to the study. The biggest increases, however, were registered in Patagonia and the Northeastern parts of Argentina (Noreste Argentino - NEA). The Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area, the NEA and the NOA's urban areas have the highest prevalence of reported drug addiction problems. Poor and disadvantaged neighborhoods show both higher levels and greater increases of microtrafficking over the years, according to the most recent findings. More than 65 percent of residents in areas with low socio-economic indicators and nearly 80 percent of those living in ""villas"" (Argentina's urban slums) reported having witnessed drug trafficking in their neighborhoods. Areas with a lower police presence also registered higher levels of microtrafficking. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Microtrafficking Meanwhile, Argentina's La Nacion recently pointed to the possible development of a new ecstasy trafficking route through the country's Northwestern provinces bordering Bolivia and Paraguay -- areas that have previously been signaled as important transit points by an earlier UCA report. More than 90,000 doses of ecstasy have been seized in the Jujuy and Formosa provinces in 2017, a significant increase in comparison to the whole of 2016, during which annual seizures reached just under 71,000 doses. Citing an anonymous antinarcotics official, La Nacion said that synthetic drug traffickers were now using routes originating from neighboring Bolivia and Paraguay traditionally used to smuggle cocaine paste and marijuana. Large seizures of ecstasy, produced mostly in Europe, have generally been seen in airports and maritime ports nearer to Buenos Aires. Concerns have risen in Argentina in recent years over increases in the domestic trafficking market and local consumption, so much so that Pope Francis was prompted to speak out on the issue towards the end of last year. The trend of rising consumption is a likely consequence of the country's role as a drug transshipment point. Although synthetic drugs such as ecstasy are not the most consumed in Argentina -- the UCA report ranks marijuana and cocaine as the most popular drugs - the growing volume of seizures of these substances speaks to the trend of increasing overall consumption. The amount of synthetic drugs seized between the first ten months of 2015 and 2016 reportedly multiplied by five. It's possible that the increase in demand led to the development of new routes for ecstasy, as argued by La Nacion. Argentina's growing synthetic drug use has been a trigger for domestic production -- although European synthetic substances maintain a large share of Argentina's market, the country's first synthetic drug lab was discovered in 2013. Authorities have been struggling to tackle this growing problem. Due to the country's inefficient legislative framework, the size of Argentina's federal prison population incarcerated for drug-related crimes more than doubled in ten years , with drug consumers making up for half of those behind bars , more than those charged with drug trafficking. In addition, and as shown by the UCA report's data, there is a clear correlation between socio-economic factors and the development of the local drug trade, so focusing just on punitive measures against individuals involved in the drug trade promises to prove insufficient. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Argentina There does appear to be growing awareness among decision makers of the need to approach drug consumption as a public health issue, rather than just a criminal one. In December 2016, a legal reform was submitted in Argentina's congress to offer rehabilitation solutions to the country's growing cocaine paste consumption problem. But, facing a public becoming increasingly concerned over drug trafficking issues, Argentina's President Mauricio Macri ran part of his successful 2015 campaign on a platform of tough policies against drug trafficking. Once in power, the new president effectively started militarizing the figh t against organized crime, even as examples across the region have shown the negative long term effects of this strategy. Law enforcement efforts are far from fruitless against drug-related crimes -- the UCA's study shows that areas with lesser police presence are more prone to microtrafficking. But security policies alone do not address the socio-economic issues that feed the drug trade. As such, and as argued by the report's conclusions , there is a need for Argentina's authorities to adopt comprehensive strategies that go beyond security measures to include health and socio-economic programs. In their absence, there is little hope that the country will succeed in reversing the trend of growing drug consumption."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Alleged Barbie Associate Facing Charges in Costa Rica. In an illustration of the reach of the Beltran Leyva Organization, an associate of Edgar Valdez Villareal, alias La Barbie , is facing trial in Costa Rica for drug trafficking, according to a report by La Nacion newspaper. Walberto Salazar Cuero, alias Guavita , is the owner of a small fishing fleet. He allegedly helped Valdez move upwards of three tons of cocaine per month along the Pacific Coast. The cocaine is thought to come from the 30th Front Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) guerrilla group. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"A Seizure, a Lawsuit and Illegal Gold from Peru. In January 2014, InSight Crime reported on a record seizure of suspected illegal gold in Peru. Since then, that case has snowballed; marking a turning point in the modus operandi of illegal gold exports, uncovering what authorities believe is a major criminal network, and threatening to land InSight Crime in court. The article, a news brief based on a report in Peru's El Comercio newspaper, detailed how Peruvian authorities had seized over half a ton of gold from storage facilities in the city of Callao. (See response to article from Kaloti Metals and Logistics.) The seizure announced the arrival of a new era in policing the multi-billion dollar illegal gold trade in Peru, sending a message to the Peruvian companies that were moving illicit gold into legal markets that they would never again have it so easy. The report named the six Peruvian export companies and four US and Italian companies that were set to receive the shipments. In our analysis of the seizure, we discussed how, although importers ostensibly monitored their supply chains, the proof of origin documentation provided by exporters often concealed the illicit source of the gold they were buying. A year after the report, InSight Crime received a letter from the lawyers of Kaloti Metals and Logistics (KML), a Miami-based gold company that is part of the Dubai-based Kaloti business group and one of the companies named in the story. Kaloti threatened to take legal action over what it called ""unsubstantiated assertions"" and ""libelous references."" The letter stated InSight Crime had ""inaccurately associated KML with illegal mining operations in Peru,"" and ""wrongfully established that [KML] was engaged in importing illegal gold."" The letter concluded with a threat to take legal action unless all mention of Kaloti was removed from the article and InSight Crime published a letter of apology for inaccurate reporting on the front page of our website. We did not remove the article. This is the story of a gold seizure that changed the game for illegal mining in Peru -- and why we stand by the original story. The Callao Seizure In December 2013, agents from Peru's tax and customs agency, the SUNAT, seized 508 kilos of gold from a storage facility in the city of Callao. The seizure was a culmination of government efforts to crack down on the trade. The sector had exploded when international gold prices soared, but it was becoming associated with environmental devastation, human trafficking and money laundering. In 2012, the government overhauled the penal code, giving prosecutors new powers to directly confront a trade that previously had been classified as a minor environmental crime. While the impact was first felt at the mines themselves, by late 2013, the government was targeting the companies involved in trading and exporting the tons of illegal gold being sacked from regions such as Madre de Dios in Peru's southeast. Ferrari became an infamous figure in Peru, spending several years in prison and standing trial for money laundering, drug trafficking and tax evasion -- and walking away free each time. The gold seized in Callao, for instance, belonged to six Peruvian export companies, and was being prepared for air dispatch to one refinery based in Italy and three in the United States -- among them Kaloti Metals & Logistics. InSight Crime was unable to discover which of the companies was exporting to Kaloti from this shipment. However, of the six, three companies have traded with Kaloti since 2012, according to commercially obtained export data; Minerales Rivero, CG Koenig and Giovanni Gold. Official sources in Peru confirmed to InSight Crime that whichever of these companies was dispatching to Kaloti, there were only two possible outcomes for the gold they were preparing to send. One option is that it was permanently seized and the export company is now under investigation for money laundering. The other is that it was spirited away under the nose of the authorities after a bizarre series of events that helped investigators uncover what they now suspect is a major criminal network whose reach expands far beyond the gold trade. A Suspicious Company Approximately one third of the gold, belonging to five of the six exporters, was seized permanently after the exporters were unable to prove its origin. The companies and many of their executives are now under investigation for suspicion of money laundering by Peru's Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF) and the money laundering unit of the prosecutors office. However, for the other company involved, Minerales Rivero, which has in the past supplied Kaloti, the story took an unexpected twist. Minerales Rivero was founded in 2013 by 34-year-old Miguel Angel Rivero Perez with a capital of just 15,000 soles ($4,800). However, within six months it had exported nearly five tons of gold. The key to its success lay not with Rivero but with the company's financial backer, his uncle Pedro Perez Miranda. Better known as ""Peter Ferrari,"" in the 1990s Ferrari became an infamous figure in Peru, spending several years in prison and standing trial for money laundering, drug trafficking and tax evasion -- and walking away free each time. While the authorities lost the gold, they were left with a glimpse of a powerful criminal network whose reach extended deep into state institutions. Ferrari, according to his lawyer, finances Rivero Minerales through an investment contract. However, he is not only an investor in gold companies, but also a suspected ""principal financier and trader of illegal gold, which he exports using Lima based front companies,"" according to a prosecutors' investigation obtained by Cuarto Poder (see video below). Although he does not yet face charges, prosecutors believe Ferrari has exported over $600 million of illegal gold. After losing their gold in the Callao seizure, Ferrari and his allies began to flex their muscles. Representatives of Rivero flew to Callao, where they became involved in a legal tug of war for the gold; a tug of war they won after a ruling by a local judge, who was later removed from his position, and arrested on charges of corruption and ties to organized crime. While the authorities contested the ruling, Rivero's recovery crew, which by now included police, lawyers, and prosecutors, managed to secure the gold anew. Video footage shows Miguel Rivero watching as his lawyers, escorted by police with riot shields, rush to load up a car with gold bars. A Larger Network The plot then took a further twist. At the time, El Comercio noted how the lawyers and officials that helped smuggle away the gold were all connected in one way or another to one man, Rodolfo Orellana. Orellana, who was arrested in November 2014 , is allegedly the mastermind of a criminal network involved in corrupt property deals and money laundering. He is also connected to human trafficking, prostitution and drug trafficking. He has since been called to testify about his role in the Callao seizure and Peter Ferrari's gold interests. While the authorities lost the gold, they were left with a glimpse of a powerful criminal network whose reach extended deep into state institutions. ""This is a case of a hidden criminal organization in Peru that had links with the Public Ministry and judicial powers, and it has now become a mega-investigation,"" Sergio Espinoza, deputy superintendent of the UIF, told InSight Crime. ""They have this end of exporting gold, but they also have corruption, drug trafficking and various other activities."" Right of Reply Kaloti's seized gold would already have passed through several hands as it moved from mine to warehouse. Each set of hands would have had to provide the company with documentation demonstrating its legality, says Alvaro Rodriguez, Kaloti's operational manager. ""You have a mining concession that has a contract with miners, the miners sell the material to consolidator, the consolidator exports. All along that supply chain all the documentation has to tie in together,"" he said. Even before this process begins, Rodriguez says Kaloti not only checks the companies have the appropriate licenses and registries, it also performs a background check on shareholders and key personnel. Kaloti's compliance with the legal requirements for importing gold is verified by third-party auditors, he added. However, Rodriguez declined to comment on any specific allegations of business ties that suggest their monitoring protocols have failed to weed out suspicious suppliers. Rodriguez did not address the company's connections to the exporters under investigation for money laundering, the ties to Peter Ferrari's front companies, or the relationship the company has with the suppliers based in the illegal mining hub of Madre de Dios that have been publicly identified as buyers of gold produced by the region's most notorious illegal mining clan. ""What I can tell you is that we have indeed followed the appropriate protocols according to international standards,"" said Rodriguez. ""You make your best effort to verify the information that is provided, but unfortunately we don't have the capacity to have as far a reach as the local agencies that are in charge of enforcement or licensing."" So is it fair to say Kaloti may have been importing illegal gold even though it had met its legal obligations over due diligence and compliance protocols? The Callao seizure heralded the beginnings of a new era in which exporting illegal gold will not be so easy. ""Any standards you have you always have to apply to the best of your abilities and at the end of the day they are guidelines because there are elements at play that are beyond our control,"" said Rodriguez. And is it fair to say Kaloti cannot say with any certainty it was not about to import illegal gold before it was seized in Callao? ""That's part of the ongoing investigation; that hasn't been determined,"" he said. ""The authorities are acting under what their presumptions are and there is a due process that is required for this investigation and that is what we have to respect."" But can Kaloti deny reports in the Peruvian media that the company itself is now part of the Peruvian authorities' investigations? ""They are ongoing investigations, and there is nothing that has been published as far as the authorities indicating that's the case, which is why we're a bit surprised in the manner in which certain news sources have obtained and publicized certain information that is quite frankly privileged,"" said Rodriguez. Rodriguez added that Kaloti threatened to take legal action against InSight Crime because the company felt our article falsely attempted to establish Kaloti was involved in importing illegal materials. When pressed over whether the permanent seizure of the gold destined for Kaloti and the investigations in Peru imply that the company was likely about to import illegal gold even if it was unaware of it, he replied, ""In the case you're asking about, that is still ongoing and that will be determined."" Rodriguez added that the original El Comerico article was based on information that was either inaccurate, mischaracterized or privileged, but would not comment on which parts of the story they took issue with. Espinoza, however, confirmed that the information regarding the companies named in the El Comericio story was accurate. The New Game The Callao seizure heralded the beginnings of a new era in which exporting illegal gold will not be so easy. The result, says Espinoza, was an overhaul of the methods used to smuggle illegal gold out of Peru. ""Seizures have dropped a lot, because the presumption is that they are now smuggling it across the border to Bolivia,"" he said. This new modus operandi has already been exposed by investigative journalist Oscar Castillo and the news site Ojo Publico. Castillo said there had been a 4,000 percent increase in Bolivian exports from 2013 to 2014, much of it linked to Peruvian companies with suspected ties to illegal gold. His report named Kaloti, which has an office in Bolivia, as among the recipients of the suspect gold. The evolution of export routes shows the illegal gold trade in Peru is evolving to meet the challenges of the authorities' crackdown, and no doubt will continue to do so as long as there are buyers for their black market product. Kaloti, meanwhile, maintains it is trying its best under difficult circumstances in both Peru and Bolivia and has at no moment shirked its supply chain monitoring obligations. ""We're just people who work here and at the end of the day we're trying to do our job correctly and appropriately according to the laws and regulations that apply to us,"" said Rodriguez. However, for the UIF, foreign companies buying gold from Peru must take more responsibility. ""It is relatively easy to prove whether certain gold comes from a legal concession or not. They have the ability to prove this,"" said Espinoza. ""The foreign buyer has the responsibility to know who he is buying from and knowing that they are not a criminal organization, they are not cutting down forests, damaging the environment, or employing children."" Kaloti Metals and Logistics responds: Kaloti Metals & Logistics Announces Further Strengthening of Compliance Initiatives January 5, 2016 --Miami, FL--Kaloti Metals & Logistics (KML), a family-owned business based in Miami and operating throughout The Americas, reaffirms its commitment to conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical values. KML continues to strengthen its robust and ample Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) program. Internal and external company compliance personnel are dedicated to ensuring complete compliance with all applicable domestic and international laws and regulations. In addition, the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA) and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 require financial institutions, including dealers in precious metals, to establish an anti-money laundering program. KML has an established organizational AML/CFT program that is sensitive to differences in laws, regulations, procedures and practices across multiple borders while taking a proactive approach to supply chain due diligence. In doing so, KML has implemented measures based on published recommendations by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). On December 16, 2015 a false, erroneous and libelous article was published in InSight Crime. Addressed as follows are the major untrue statements contained in the article. The article describes Kaloti Metals & Logistics as part of the Dubai-based company Kaloti Jewellery Group (KJI). This is not factual; KML is an independent, Florida-based corporation which conducts business with KJI. The article strongly implies that KML is under investigation by Peruvian authorities. This is also untrue. KML is not under investigation by Peruvian authorities, but has provided information and cooperated when requested. Despite the fact that there are six similar companies operating in Peru, the author failed to name the other international refineries that purchase precious metals in Peru. Instead, KML was solely mentioned some 21 times. During a telephone interview with the reporter, substantial background was provided by the company which the publication ignored or distorted. ""KML is acutely aware of the inherent challenges of conducting business in this industry and takes great pride in its commitment to establishing a culture of compliance throughout all of its business dealings. KML fully supports all government authorities, both domestic and abroad, in their fight against illegal mining activities,"" said Awni Kaloti, Managing Director. KML has successfully undergone independent third party compliance auditing by ACAMS certified specialists who have deemed KML to be not only fully compliant with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines for Responsible Sourcing of Precious Metals but also meet all the applicable requirements of laws and regulations Kaloti continued: ""The company must protect its reputation, and does not fathom why this publication chose to engage in false reporting. KML reiterates that it only engages in business with companies that possess the appropriate documentation to conduct commercial activity at the time of transaction and that are in compliance with all legal requirements of the United States and the country of origin."" It should also be noted that, when necessary, KML has taken preemptive action to discontinue business activity with some companies based on its sown Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) and activity-monitoring measures. As an industry leader, KML also regularly engages in dialogue with exporters and producers with the goal of promoting responsible sourcing practices."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
New President to Push for US Military Aid to Guatemala. With former General Otto Perez set to assume Guatemala's presidency on January 14, he has indicated that he will continue pushing for the resumption of military aid from the US. Perez's incoming foreign minister told the AP that Perez will lobby for the resumption of military aid to Guatemala, which authorities argue is needed to fight drug trafficking and crime. US Congress halted all military aid to Guatemala in 1990, although there are indications that millions of dollars in covert aid continued to flow into the country for some years afterwards. The US relaxed the restrictions somewhat in 2007, allowing for the purchase of helicopters for the Guatemala Air Force, intended to be used to fight drug trafficking. This is a cause taken up by previous administrations, including Perez's predecessor, President Alvaro Colom. During a trip to Washington DC during his final weeks in office, Colom met with a Department of Defense representative and said they'd established six conditions for the partial resumption of military aid to Guatemala. The condition which might prove the most difficult for Perez's government requires the release of all military documents related to Guatemala's civil war. There is little chance that Perez will prove willing to do so, considering his level of support from the military. He has also faced accusations of committing human rights violations during the conflict. Another Perez advisor told the AP that Guatemala would look for military aid from other countries, if the US does not help provide the equipment needed to boost law enforcement efforts. This may be subtle reference to the fact that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is set to attend Perez's swearing in ceremony. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Recycles Security Strategy in Embattled Michoacan. Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto's mass deployment of federal forces to Michoacan is reminiscent of his predecessor Felipe Calderon's militarized security strategy in the troubled state. Mexico's central government is sending 5,000 federal agents (made up of federal police, army and marine units) to the southwest state of Michoacan, reported El Universal. The surge builds on the 3,000 agents already patrolling the state. Michoacan Governor Silvano Aureoles Conejo said an evaluation is being conducted to determine the most at-risk areas where the arriving forces will be deployed. Of particular concern are Michoacan's borders with neighboring Jalisco, Guanajuato, Guerrero and the State of Mexico, Conjeo added. The federal agents are being deployed alongside an expected ramp up in Pena Nieto's ""Mando Unico,"" or Singe Command initiative. The program aims to replace local police agencies thought to be infiltrated by organized crime with a single police force commanded at the state level. According to El Universal, 76 Michoacan municipalities have so far signed up for Mando Unico. With their local police forces disbanded, security for these municipalities has been taken over by the 3,000 federal agents already present in Michoacan. Upon taking office in 2012, Pena Nieto said his administration's security strategy would place a greater emphasis on crime prevention and violence reduction. However, Pena Nieto's latest deployment of federal forces echoes similar actions taken by Calderon, whose reliance on the military to battle fearsome drug cartels became an integral part of Mexico's so-called ""War on Drugs."" One of Calderon's first acts after becoming president was to send 6,500 troops to restore order in his home state of Michoacan. The troops were supposed to be a temporary measure, but six years later the administration sent another 4,000 to the state. The 5,000 federal agents Pena Nieto is deploying to Michoacan -- on top of the 3,000 already there -- are likely to stay for the long-term as well. As more municipal police forces are dissolved under Mando Unico, the state will become even more dependent on federal security forces. However, there is reason to doubt that this latest surge will lead to better results than previous ones. Despite the dismantling of criminal organization the Knights Templar, violence in Michoacan remains stubbornly high , and self-defense groups continue to engage in bloody shootouts ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Peru, Colombia Strengthen Ties Against Organized Crime. The defense ministers of Peru and Colombia have agreed to strengthen their cooperation in the fight against organized crime along their shared border. The agreement will target drug trafficking, money laundering, smuggling, illegal mining and logging, and the smuggling of native species, according to the EFE news agency. The ministers, Alberto Otarola of Peru and Juan Carlos Pinzon of Colombia, also said education and health programs would target the vulnerable populations of the border region. The AP reports that a more detailed agreement will be reached at a conference in March, which Brazilian delegates will also attend. In addition, an Andina report highlighted the two countries' interest in joint development of their defense industries, including the possibility of developing a joint Peruvian-Colombian river patrol boat. Otarola and Pinzon also discussed heightening collaboration with other countries on regional security issues. In May 2011 the two signed a border security agreement. This agreement seems to be targeted against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ), who operate in the border region between Peru and Colombia. The comprehensive nature of the plans discussed could be a response to the changing tactics of the FARC, who have moved to Colombia's border regions, and across into neigboring countries, and have diversified their sources of income. This announcement fits in with a bigger regional picture of military integration to fight organized crime. Many South American countries have paired up in the past year with bilateral security initiatives. In the latest example, Venezuela and Brazil confirmed January 25 that their security forces would cooperate against organized crime. The issue of organized crime could also be used to build confidence between the security forces of countries with complicated relationships. For example, despite tensions over a 2008 Colombian raid against FARC guerillas on Ecuadorian soil, those two countries have also signed a bilateral security agreement targeting the group. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
ELN Hope to Force Their Way into Peace Talks. Rebels from Colombia 's smaller rebel group have kidnapped five prospectors and launched attacks across the country in an effort to force the government into granting them a seat at peace negotiations. Guerrillas from the National Liberation Army ( ELN ) snatched five members of a gold mining exploration team, among them a Canadian and two Peruvians, in the south of Bolivar province, long a rebel stronghold. The Peruvian government has sent two police colonels to work alongside the Colombian security forces. The Colombian government has deployed 1,500 troops, among them special forces, to pursue the kidnappers and free the hostages. Army sources indicated that several ELN units had been involved in the kidnapping operation, suggesting that it may have been planned well in advance. The ELN were told earlier this month that the government would not start a peace process yet with this group. The government has expressed willingness to engage with the ELN, but it appears the time is not yet propitious. The government has been in peace talks, since September last year, with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ). Talks are currently underway with the FARC in Cuba, and the government said that this rebel group has until November 2013 to reach a peace agreement to bring an end to 48 years of civil conflict. The area where the kidnappings took place is close to one of the ELN's historic strongholds. In the southern part of Bolivar province there are not only heavily armed ELN units, but also several hundred fighters of their FARC allies. The FARC had declared a unilateral truce from November 20, 2012 to January 20, 2013 hoping to prompt the government into making it a bilateral ceasefire. The government has ruled out such a step, at least for now, and the security forces are braced for a FARC offensive, which the ELN may well now also join. Indeed on the 20th, when the truce expired, the FARC blew up an oil pipeline in the southern province of Putumayo. The ELN have not restricted their hostilities to this kidnapping. Since the start of this year they have launched actions in the provinces of Arauca, Boyaca, Choco and Norte de Santander. They have also blown up an oil pipeline in Norte de Santander, twice. The ELN are copying the FARC tactics of hitting multinationals and key infrastructure. From January to August last year, the FARC targeted oil, electricity and mining infrastructure and personnel across the country, a strategy which is believed to have contributed to the fact that the government opened peace talks with them. While the ELN does not have the same reach as the FARC, they can make life very difficult for the government in seven of Colombia's 32 departments or provinces. This is not the first time the ELN have tried to kidnap their way into a peace process. In 1999, after the FARC were given a 42,000 km2 safe haven by then president Andres Pastrana, the ELN requested a similar demilitarised zone in the south of Bolivar province. When the government refused, the ELN conducted three high profile kidnapping operations. In April 1999 ELN rebels hijacked a domestic flight in midair, forcing the pilots to land on a jungle airstrip and kidnapping all 46 people on board. In May the same year, 160 people were taken from a church in the outskirts of Cali. This was followed in June with the interception of a boat near the Caribbean city of Barranquilla from which nine people were kidnapped. Despite these operations, the ELN were unable to force the government into granting it equal treatment to its more powerful FARC cousins. The same is likely to be the case now. While the FARC have asked for the inclusion of their ELN allies into the peace process, the government is not yet ready to open dialogue with the 3000-strong group. Sources close to the negotiations have told InSight Crime that there are several reasons for this, the first among them that the government wants to make some concrete progress with the FARC first. Other reasons are that the ELN want to discuss many more themes than those on the FARC agenda, and is insisting on the inclusion of civil society in the dialogue. The government fears this will simply bog down the entire process. While the FARC have abandoned kidnap for ransom, one of the government preconditions for sitting down to talks, the ELN still use this as a principal means of raising revenue, along with extortion, and increasingly, drug trafficking. Fears are that more kidnappings are likely during 2013.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"El Salvador Ex-President Funes Trash Bags Full of Money. El Salvador has not sparked as much attention as its neighbors when it comes to corruption scandals, but a litany of accusations against former President Mauricio Funes and his relatives along with millions of dollars transferred in trash bags might change that. The scheme was relatively straight forward. A member of the corruption network allegedly headed by former Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes during his 2009 to 2014 term would arrive at a state bank, fill up big black trash bags with thousands of dollars in cash and then drive them to the presidential residence. The money was allegedly for Funes, his family and other members of his inner circle who used it to pay for travel, properties, luxury goods and services such as plastic surgery, according to El Salvador's Attorney General's Office. The trash bags might seem like a small detail, but they aren't. They speak not only to the large amounts of cash that the president's men picked up on Funes' orders, but also to the complicity of a broad network that included the head of the Banco Hipotecario, one of the main banks managing government funds in El Salvador. In a June 8 press conference, El Salvador's Attorney General Douglas Melendez accused Funes and his network of embezzling $351 million, an amount equivalent to nearly 1.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017, or about seven percent of the government's 2017 budget. The Attorney General's Office has dubbed the case ""Public Looting."" The Salvadoran Attorney General's Office has issued 32 arrest warrants in the case, including for Funes, his former private and communications secretaries, administrative personnel from his administration, the head of Banco Hipotecario, Funes' partner and her parents, as well as his ex-wife and two sons. Twenty-seven of the suspects are accused of money laundering, while two are accused of obstruction of justice. On June 5, six suspects were arrested. Among them was businessman Miguel Melendez Avelar. Known by the alias ""Mecafe,"" Avelar is suspected of orchestrating the diversion of public funds into the construction of a spa tied to Funes' partner, Ada Michelle Guzman, according to an investigation by the news outlet El Faro. For a short period, Mecafe served as the head of a state-run fairground and event space in the capital of San Salvador, where he met regularly with Funes and his inner circle, according to information two former officials in Funes' administration gave to InSight Crime. In a video circulated in El Salvador, Mecafe can be seen giving money to former Attorney General Luis Martinez, who is currently under arrest in relation to a separate corruption case. ""We have found a sophisticated structure created by ex-President Funes and Miguel Menendez Avelar to extract public funds from the state and subsequently launder and invest them using the names of frontmen, companies and individuals,"" said Attorney General Melendez during the June 8 press conference. According to the Attorney General's Office, the diversion of the funds began in El Salvador's presidential palace. There, Funes ordered various government ministries to redirect money to his administration. Then the president's private office deposited the money in the accounts of employees and companies through the Banco Hipotecario. One way the cash was brought back to the president and his collaborators was the aforementioned black plastic bags. In 2009, Funes was the first Salvadoran president to enter office representing the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation (Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional - FMLN), a former guerrilla group that converted into a political party following the signing of a peace accord that ended the country's civil war in 1992. Funes' campaign platform centered on the fight against corruption, which he attributed to El Salvador's four previous presidents whose administrations spanned from 1989 to 2009 and who were members of the right-wing National Republican Alliance (Alianza Republicana Nacionalista -- ARENA) party. El Salvador's justice system first initiated a civil lawsuit against Funes in 2016, after the country's Supreme Court detected irregularities in the former president's financial statements. Funes, supported by his party, fled to Nicaragua, where the government of Daniel Ortega granted him political asylum. Last week, Attorney General Melendez announced that he will request the extradition of Funes and for an Interpol red notice to be issued for his arrest. Funes insists that all of the accusations are fabrications orchestrated by his political enemies and that his life is in danger. A judge in San Salvador has also ordered the arrest of Vanda Pignato, the former first lady of El Salvador, who has been accused of money laundering. If prosecutors' accusations end in convictions, Funes will go down in history as one of the politicians who most ransacked the Salvadoran treasury. Antonio Saca, Funes' predecessor, who is currently in prison awaiting trial on charges of corruption and money laundering, has been accused by the Attorney General's Office of stealing $301 million from government coffers. Francisco Flores, the president who preceded Saca, died while being prosecuted for diverting funds from international donations. One suspect implicated in the case against Funes, Jorge Alberto Hernandez Castellano, the vice president of El Salvador's largest and most influential television network Telecorporacion Salvadorena, is also accused of having laundered money for Saca. According to two sources consulted by InSight Crime, Hernandez Castellano has testified against Funes in exchange for leniency in his sentencing, such as serving time under house arrest. Hernandez Castellano was part of the inner circle of both former presidents and is presumed, among other things, to have paid bribes to journalists using public funds. The corrupt actors in El Salvador's recent administrations appear to be many and varied, ranging from the press to private and state banks that received funds extracted from public accounts and government institutions. In total, the embezzlement attributed to Saca and Funes reaches nearly $700 million, equal to El Salvador's fiscal deficit, which has recently brought the country to the verge of default. The embezzlement schemes took place as the country's public security conditions have worsened over the last decade, reaching an average of 20 homicides per day and rates as high as 100 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. Funes' administration also leveraged a truce between the government and the MS13 and Barrio 18 gangs to engage in further acts of corruption. When the truce fell apart, it sparked a war between security forces and gangs, which has fueled extrajudicial executions attributed to police officers and soldiers. When it comes to corruption in the Northern Triangle of Central America, El Salvador has not attracted the same level of attention as its neighbors Guatemala and Honduras, both of which receive support from international organizations for their fights against corruption. But the large sums of money ransacked from the coffers of the region's smallest country, makes it at least equally relevant."	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"Argentina: A Haven for Colombian Narcos?Reports that two of Colombia's most wanted drug traffickers traveled to Argentina to hold talks are only the latest evidence that the country is being used as a hideout and base of operations by members of the Colombian underworld. According to a report in newspaper El Tiempo , Maximiliano Bonilla Orozco, alias "" Valenciano ,"" and Erick Vargas Cardenas, alias "" Sebastian ,"" traveled to the city of Rosario, in northern Argentina, to negotiate a truce. The two men, who are currently locked in a struggle for control of the Colombian city of Medellin, spent at least three days in Rosario in early September, according to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sources consulted by El Tiempo. The agency is reportedly investigating how the pair, who between them have rewards worth at least $6 million on their heads from the U.S. and Colombian governments, could have managed to elude authorities and spend time in one of Argentina's major cities without being caught. If the story is true, it would not be the first time that high-up members of the Colombian drug trade have used Argentina as a safe location to carry out business, or even to live. The drive to increase security in Colombia over the last decade left many kingpins needing to leave the country, no longer able to enjoy the high life of a Pablo Escobar, and Argentina is suitably far away, as well as being a good location to run trafficking operations and launder money. Most famously, Hector Edilson Duque Ceballos, alias ""Monoteto,"" a top member of the Cordillera Cartel, was gunned down in a Buenos Aires shopping mall in 2008. Some reports even said that he had gone to Argentina in order to murder another then-member the same Medellin mafia group as Bonilla and Vargas, who was in the country for surrender negotiations with the DEA. There are many other high-profile cases. Ignacio Alvarez Meyendorff, allegedly a one-time member the Norte del Valle Cartel and still a leading trafficker, was arrested at Buenos Aires international airport in April on his way back from a trip to Tahiti. He had reportedly been living in a fashionable neighborhood of the city since 2005, and had not apparently been overly cautious with security; he had left and re-entered the country a number of times, and had set up various business enterprises. His fall followed that of business associate Luis Agustin Caicedo Velandia, ""Don Lucho,"" also caught in Argentina, who likely betrayed him. Alvarez's brother, Juan Fernando Alvarez Meyendorff, alias ""Mecha,"" is also thought to be living in the Argentine capital. According to reports , he was detained by police along with Caicedo in 2010, but released without being identified. Particularly media-friendly was the story of Angela Sanclemente, a former Colombian beauty queen who allegedly headed a massive drug smuggling network that shipped cocaine out of Buenos Aires (see photo, above). She is currently being held in a Argentine jail. Peruvian traffickers are also building links in Argentina, as detailed in a recent investigation by newspaper Clarin. Despite the arrest of Peruvian alleged capo Marco Antonio Estrada Gonzales, alias ""Marcos,"" in 2007, he has continued to run the trade in a neighborhood of Buenos Aires called Bajo Flores, which is the city's hub for the sale of cocaine and ""paco,"" a crack-like substance. The product sold there all comes from Peru, and is transported to Argentina by land or by air, with drug ""mules"" who ingest a load being a thing of the past, according to the report. There have even been reports that Mexican capo Joaquin Guzman , alias ""El Chapo,"" perhaps the most wanted man in the world, had moved to Argentina in 2010, leaving only in March of this year. However, Argentina is not just attracting high-profile capos, but also the lower-down managers who run the drug trade day by day. These Colombian middle-managers are locating themselves in Argentina in order to oversee the export of drugs to Europe, according to reports going back as far as 2008. A recent article in El Pais announced that ""the Colombian drug trade has shifted to the south of the continent,"" with Argentina becoming a new center of operations for traffickers. The country is good place to base a drug trafficking business, as it has become increasingly important as a transshipment point for drugs being sent to Europe, either via West Africa or Spain. It shares long land borders with drug-producing Bolivia, and with Paraguay, an important transit route for cocaine and producer of marijuana. Meanwhile the high volume of cargo that passes through its many sea ports and airports help to disguise outgoing drug shipments. El Pais report highlights the role of Colombians located in the city of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, in shipping cocaine into Argentina. According to the newspaper, Colombian traffickers have set up factories around the city, which process coca leaves from the conveniently close-by Chapare region, one of the country's biggest producers of the leaf. These factories ship drugs over the border into Argentina in ""industrial quantities,"" using roads which are deserted and underpoliced, reports El Pais. As InSight Crime has noted , there have been reports that up to 3,000 Colombians are now based in the city, many thought to have arrived there around 2006 Argentina did not have the necessary climate or location to play a major part in the rise of cocaine in the last century, and this relative absence of the drug business has contributed to the country having a lax regulatory climate and less vigorous law enforcement. Drug kingpins can launder their money through the country's poorly-regulated financial system. As InSight Crime has previously highlighted , this is made easier by the widespread use of cash, a legal loophole meaning it is not a crime to ""launder"" your own money, and an under-regulated real estate sector. Another attraction for drug traffickers is that Argentina is an increasingly important transshipment location for chemicals used to make methamphetamine, as it does not have the restrictions placed on these chemicals in, say, Mexico. In addition to this the country is increasingly emerging as a drug market in its own right, accounting for some 25 percent of Latin America's entire cocaine consumption ."	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
"US Drug Trial Could Expose Criminal Ties of Venezuela Elites. New evidence from a high-reaching drug trafficking trial has directly implicated immediate relatives of Venezuela's president and his wife, in a saga that could expose the criminal ties of some of the country's most elite figures. Investigators in a drug case brought against Efrain Campo Flores and Franqui Francisco Flores -- nephews of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores -- have obtained key information from telephones, iPads and a computer that the suspects were carrying upon their arrest, el Nuevo Herald reported. Some of the conversations uncovered apparently prove that family members of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife participated directly in the alleged cocaine trafficking case being prosecuted in a federal court in New York. According to el Nuevo Herald's sources, justice officials have summoned 18 people from Venezuela to appear in court on October 21, including immediate relatives of the presidential couple and members of the presidential security and transportation unit, the Casa Militar. In response, lawyers for the two primary suspects reportedly wrote to the New York court asking that the summons requests be suspended, and that any evidence obtained through them be excluded from the case. The Flores nephews were arrested in Haiti in November 2015 and are facing charges of conspiring to smuggle 800 kilograms of cocaine into the United States. Their prosecution appeared to be in some trouble only weeks ago , when it was discovered that some of the informants in the investigation were potentially unreliable. The two defendants signed written confessions shortly after their arrests, which their legal team had also tried to exclude from evidence. However, the federal judge in the case ruled on October 12 that prosecutors could indeed submit those confessions as evidence in the trial. Developments in the Flores case may well lengthen the list of Venezuelan elites implicated in the alleged drug trafficking scheme -- including the first lady's brother -- adding weight to notions that the country is increasingly displaying the characteristics of a mafia state. High-ranking Venezuelan officials have long been strongly suspected of playing a key role in international cocaine trafficking, and the United States has brought drug charges against some of the top figures of the Maduro government. Furthermore, military involvement in contraband activities has been facilitated by President Maduro's decision to put the armed forces in charge of food distribution in July 2016. The Venezuelan state is also facing conditions that have allowed violent crime and insecurity to spiral out of control. Part of the blame for this trend lies with criminal groups closely tied to government institutions. Venezuela's notorious colectivos -- pro-government left-wing militias -- so-called "" mega-gangs "" and corrupt police rings are thought to be behind surging rates of extortion and kidnappings, which have nearly doubled in the past year. Another form of criminal-state collusion was recently brought to the fore by opposition politician Americo De Grazia, who said in an interview that ""organized crime has become state policy"" in the eastern Bolivar region. De Grazia's statement came days after an organized criminal group -- escorted by state security forces -- allegedly massacred 11 people at an illegal mine in Bolivar controlled by another gang. Such cases illustrate the Venezuelan government's complicity in the disturbing escalation of criminality over the past few years. With the country's economic and political crisis unlikely to improve in the near term, the permeation of Venezuelan institutions by organized crime could worsen going forward."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Ten Years of Violent Deaths in Guatemala. Guatemala lowered its rate of homicides per 100,000 inhabitants for the second consecutive year in 2013, according to data from the National Civil Police (PNC). But are the policies of the current government to thank for this accomplishment? ""I think over the last two years, which have been our responsibility, important steps have been taken to move the country toward a more prosperous and secure Guatemala,"" said Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina after hearing the results of a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report that emphasizes the failure of ""mano dura"" (""iron fist"") policies in the region. The proof that his policies have been successful, the president said, is the reduction of the homicide rate from 38.61 per 100,000 people to 34.03, after two years in office. Reprinted with permission from Plaza Publica. Read original version here. The data, held aloft by the President of the Republic and Interior Ministry, represents the lowest homicide rate in the last decade. Yet, the same figures from the General Operations Branch of the National Civil Police (PNC) show something different. First, the downward trend of killings started in the last quarter of 2009, despite it being the year with the highest rate of homicides (46.36 per 100,000), and the downward trend has continued since then. In early October 2011, Carlos Mendoza, an analyst at Central American Business Intelligence (CABI), analyzed monthly patterns in homicide numbers and concluded there was a downward trend. CABI statistics, based on data from the PNC, showed a peak in homicides in August 2008 -- when 616 cases were reported. After that date, Mendoza stressed that he saw a ""downward trend, albeit with some volatility."" The existence of sustained declines of up to six months between several violent peaks supported his ideas. In the last two years of the administration of President Alvaro Colom, murders were already falling. The PNC reported a drop of 538 cases in 2010 compared to 2009, and 279 less again the following year, in 2011. This trend then continues into the first year of the presidency of Perez Molina, with a drop of 526 homicides in 2012, compared to the year before. In contrast, the monthly patterns of killings showed a slight increase in cases reported by the PNC in early 2013 compared to 2012 (98 cases more); something that specialists have noted. Carmen Rosa de Leon, at the Institute for Teaching Sustainable Development (Iepades), is adamant that an impasse in this downward trend has been reached. ""Since 2009 there was a steady reduction in homicides. And what we see is that while the rate dropped last year, it is more due to projected population growth than more effective crime prevention,"" she said. De Leon's argument regarding population increase is based on a projected growth of 2.5 percent per year according to the National Statistics Institute (INE) , which caused the homicide rate to fall despite there being 98 cases were more in 2013 than the previous year. For De Leon, like Mendoza, the rise in homicides registered by the PNC in November and December 2012 (476 and 494 respectively) and in January 2013 (505 cases) placed a yellow alert over the job the authorities had been doing. Even the CABI raised the alert level over the growth in the homicide statistics after seeing data from the first quarter of 2013, which increased almost eight percentage points over the same period in 2012 -- equivalent to more than 284 murders. Thus, the statistics give no indication that the reduction comes from policies implemented by the current government. For example, the Territorial Task Force (FTT), which was advertised with great fanfare after installation and then deployed in September (Maya Task Force, Limon, zone 18) and in October (Kaminal Task Force, El Mezquital, area 12), 2012. Initially, between them they had 1,800 members (1,300 soldiers and 500 police officers) and sought to increase the security forces presence to reduce homicides in ""red"" zones on the Interior Ministry?s violence maps. Were they successful? Yes and no. Yes, in areas where they intervened. No, in the areas where the criminals migrated to, where crime increased, as happened with the residential areas on the border of Villa Nueva and El Mezquital. At the national level, the use of the FTT did not result in a significant change in the overall monthly homicide statistics: Between 2011 and 2012, the PNC reported 526 cases less -- 91.06 percent of this reduction was achieved in the first half of the year, and the most violent months of the year (November and December) were experienced when they were in operation. A second, more important, point is trying to establish which of the reasons for the reduction can be analyzed with the limited information available. In late 2009, the increase in homicides pushed the key elements of the Interior Ministry, the PNC and the Public Ministry (MP) to coordinate their research with the support of international organizations, and create an ""anti-homicides"" unit that actively participated in all institutions. In addition, added efforts were made in Guatemala City and surrounding municipalities, where slightly more than 21.76 percent of the population is concentrated, and, with a high degree of mobility, where 40.69 percent of national homicides are committed. To reduce homicides in the area directly affected by the general statistics and social perception. In 2009, the 17 municipalities of Guatemala City had a rate of 86.70 homicides per 100,000 -- 40 higher than the national rate. By December 2013, this had been reduced to 51.72 per 100,000. Nevertheless, geographically focusing efforts to combat crime has not been the only thing that ensured the reduction of homicides over the last decade. In late 2010, the Interior Ministry changed the focus of investigations into crimes against people, underpinning the work that was being done with the PNC, turning from investigating individual cases to trying to identify criminal phenomena and structures. The same was done with the crime of extortion, for which a specialized unit was also created. Between the two units, information was compiled by coordinated investigations. These two units were the basis upon which the current government created the Intelligence Task Force, in early 2012, and that enabled the investigation of entire criminal structures. ""Also in that year the scientific research of the National Institute of Forensic Science (Inacif) was cemented with ballistics and DNA testing,"" said Ernest Archila, of the Institute of Comparative Studies in Criminal Sciences in Guatemala (IECCP), putting him in agreement with Mendoza. ""The creation of Inacif, in 2007, was gradually consolidated in 2010 with human, financial and technological resources providing the tools to obtaining scientific evidence,"" he said. Claudia Paz y Paz, Attorney General, adds one more tool: the use of wiretaps. ""Although the law against organized crime was approved in 2006, wiretaps only began in 2010. And these are a very effective tool to combat crime,"" the prosecutor acknowledged in an interview with Plaza Publica. For De Leon, there is still a lack of study of other factors that they can directly cause a reduction in homicides, such as increased regulation of the use of firearms. ""The extent of murders with guns remains considerable within the overall volume, it tells us proliferation of weapons goes unresolved, especially small arms,"" he said. According to the PNC, 56,350 people died in crime-related incidents in the last decade in Guatemala, 81.77 percent of them were from firearms. This means that, on average, 12 people were killed every day by guns between 2004 and 2013. According to statistics from the General Directorate of Arms and Munitions Control (DIGECAM) in early 2013 there were three firearms per 100 people in the country. Of those, 63 percent were handguns: easy to carry and hide, as well as readily available and affordable -- from $130 on the black market to up to $2600, depending on the make and model, on the legal market. Projections from the likes of Iepades say that for every legal weapon there are three illegal weapons. The bad news extends to the number of injuries reported by the PNC. According to police, 12 more peope were injured by firearms every day for the last 10 years. In 2006, a study from the UNDP estimated the cost of treatment for those wounded in social violence to be $147 per day in the national public health network, expenses made up of the purchase of drugs, the loss of working days through incapacitation and the cost of emotional and psychological damage. To what extent can the drop in the homicide rate be explained by the change in the strategy of the authorities and the incorporation of scientific evidence? ""It's hard to measure because we do not have enough data to contrast with the homicide rates,"" says Mendoza. But what data is lacking? Reliable statistics of alcohol and drug consumption related to crimes, studies of the development of criminal behavior among gangs, international supply and demand of illicit goods, the restructuring of organized crime gangs and an analysis of the culture of violence, to name a few. To all this we would also add other measures adopted by the State that were not necessarily designed to reduce social violence but have influenced the phenomenon. For example, De Leon cites the Open Schools program, created in the government of Alvaro Colom and closed during this one, or plans to reorganize public transport with prepaid card systems. ""How much influence did 'Open Schools' have by increasing the supply of secondary education and allowing the appropriation of public space for the reduction of violence in the areas it was implemented? To what extent did not having to handle cash, because of payment cards, drive down the number of bus drivers killed over extortion? These are things that must be analyzed to understand the phenomenon of the reduction because they were processes generated not as a result of security policies but which have reduced homicides,"" said De Leon. *Reprinted with permission from Plaza Publica.

Honduras, Nicaragua Using Green Energy to Fight Drug Smuggling. The US recently helped install solar panels in naval stations in Honduras and Nicaragua, an example of the kind of creative approach needed when dealing with infrastructure shortcomings in Latin America's fight against organized crime. As highlighted in a feature story for Dialogo, a publication of the US Southern Command (Southcom), the Command installed the solar panels in order to enable communications in remote areas where electricity is not readily available. One set of solar panels were installed at Nicaragua's naval outpost in the Miskito Cays, an archipelago in the Carribbean. The area is reportedly a key corridor for transnational criminal groups trafficking drugs, weapons and people from South America into Mexico, according to Dialogo. Other solar panels were installed along Honduras' Caribbean coast, in the department of Gracias a Dios, meant to support operations by the Honduran Navy. The installations follow previous US aid meant to build up Central America's ability to interdict illicit shipments, including two boats and a new operations center -- worth roughly $4 million -- donated to Nicaragua in 2014, Dialogo reported. Using renewable energy to aid drug interdiction is just one example of an innovative approach to combating crime in Latin America's most remote areas. These rural, difficult-to-access areas have challenged governments across the region when it comes to extending state presence. In Guayana, for example, some police stations are without reliable telephone service. One Colombian state along the Venezuelan border, Vichada, has no paved roads. Another department along Colombia's Pacific coast, Choco, a major hub for armed groups , has roads in such bad shape that most locals depend on river transport. Drug crops are often cultivated in these areas with little state infrastructure, and criminal groups may respond to the lack of movement corridors and communication networks by making their own -- including hidden airfields and radio networks. As it is unfeasible to extend roads and power grids to every remote area -- especially in poorer nations -- creative solutions such as independent off-grid power installations and drones surveillance may become powerful tools in extending law enforcement's reach into remote areas. Meanwhile, crime-fighting efforts in more urban areas have been accompanied by the creation of a wide range of smart phone apps .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Over 60% of Brazilians Distrust the Police: Survey. A new academic study found that over half of those surveyed are dissatisfied with police performance in Brazil, a perception likely influenced by the force's long history of corruption and extrajudicial killings. According to the study, published by the Getulio Vargas Foundation's Law School in Sao Paulo, 63 percent of Brazilians are unsatisfied with police performance in Brazil, reported Folha de Sao Paulo. Brazil's judicial system also fared poorly, with 90 percent of survey respondents stating that justice is slow in the country and 64 percent claiming the judiciary is dishonest. The study found that Brazilians view the armed forces more favorably: 75 percent of those surveyed said that the military is Brazil's most trusted security institution. Part of this public distrust towards the police is likely explained by police officers' routine use of lethal force. A 2009 report by Human Rights Watch found that in 2008, police in Rio de Janeiro killed one person for every 23 arrests, while Sao Paulo police killed one for every 348. In comparison, police in the United States killed one person for every 37,000 arrests. Compounding this problem are corrupt elements in the police who are complicit in gang networks throughout the country. Earlier this month, 60 police agents in Rio de Janeiro were arrested for allegedly taking weekly bribes ranging between $700 to $1,200, in exchange for allowing gangs to continue trafficking drugs in favelas around the city. In a move praised by Human Rights Watch , Brazil's Human Rights Defense Council recently issued a resolution that lays out standard homicide investigation procedures that all state level police should follow, to ensure that police killings are properly investigated. Providing the resolution is followed it could go some way in helping restore public confidence in the police force, although it remains to be seen just how legally binding the nature of this resolution is. The release of the Getulio Vargas Foundation's report comes at a time when Sao Paulo state's police are particularly embattled: 100 police officers in the state have been killed this year, many as a result of violence attributed to fighting between the police and the First Capital Command (PCC) prison gang.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Completing Chapter, Honduras Extradites Valle Brothers to US. Two leaders of the notorious Valle Valle family now find themselves in US custody, extradited from Honduras a little over two months after their capture. The question now is what about the other top-level traffickers still at large? On December 18, the brothers Miguel Arnulfo and Luis Alonso Valle Valle were flown to the US and were being held in Virginia, reported Tiempo. Prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida await the brothers -- the leaders of a clan that was once responsible for moving upwards of 10 tons of cocaine through this country per month -- who face charges of trafficking illicit substances to the United States. The brothers were captured in the country's western border province of Copan in a joint operation involving Honduran special forces, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Guatemalan authorities. Honduras' Supreme Court indicated Jose Inocente Valle Valle, the third brother in the drug clan who was also captured in early October , is set to be extradited in 2015, reported La Prensa. The Valle brothers' extradition brings the total number of Hondurans sent to the United States on drug trafficking charges this year to four. The others were Carlos ""El Negro"" Lobo in May and Juving Alexander Suazo Peralta in October. The extradition of the Valle brothers closes a chapter on a group that six months ago was at the top of the criminal food chain in Honduras. But the quick turnaround between the capture and extradition of the Valle brothers raises a question as well: why hasn't the government captured other high-level traffickers such as the Cachiros, Jose Miguel ""Chepe"" Handal, and Alexander Ardon? The answer might be simple: there are no known charges against any of them in the United States or Honduras. The notion is stupefying when presented with the traffickers' profiles. The Cachiros, which is the nickname of the Rivera Maradiaga clan, was placed on the US Kingpin list over a year ago by the US Treasury and had an estimated $500 million in assets seized in September 2013. At its height, it was thought to move between 5 and 10 tons of cocaine through Honduras per month. ""Chepe Handal"" was put on the Kingpin list in April 2013 for running a transport group similar to that of the Cachiros. The former mayor of El Paraiso, Copan, Alexander Ardon -- believed to be the namesake of the ""Cartel de Alex,"" which reportedly had strong ties to the Valles -- is considered a large trafficker in his own right and a major ally of the Sinaloa Cartel. There is, of course, the strong belief that the US is preparing to file charges against these criminal figures or has sealed the indictments related to them. In the meantime, there are only questions and idle security forces awaiting orders."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Kamilo Rivera and the Ghosts of Guatemalas Death Squads. Kamilo Rivera was a cop, an executioner and government minister. He is now on the run. 1. The Disappearance Kamilo Rivera arrived shortly before 6 a.m. at his office in the colonial palace, an old, greenish-grey building with thick concrete walls and cavernous hallways in the heart of Guatemala City. It houses the Interior Ministry where Rivera was a deputy minister. Rivera would not stay long that day. It was October 29, 2018, and the former police official turned deputy had discovered an arrest warrant had been issued for him three hours earlier, an investigator who participated in the operation, speaking on condition of anonymity, told InSight Crime later. Rivera and seven others had been accused of murder. Like him, they were all current or former police officials. It was an old story, but one that had haunted the ministry and the country. Between 2004 and 2007, investigators claimed, Rivera was part of a clandestine operation embedded within Guatemala's interior ministry. His group was known as the ""Riveritas"" for their boss, Victor Rivera Azuaje, a former Venezuelan police officer. Investigations by the United Nations-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG) - which serves as an appendage to the Attorney General's Office -- pointed to the Riveritas' involvement in at least three massacres: the killing of seven prisoners in the Pavon prison in 2006, the deaths of three Salvadoran legislators and their driver on February 20th, 2007, and the jailhouse murder of four police officers accused of killing the legislators six days later. The case against the Riveritas had become a symbol. For some, it was an illustration of the CICIG's earnest efforts to root out corruption and crime inside the government. For others, it was a sign of CICIG's overreach. Among those accused was the former interior minister and former boss of the Riveritas, Carlos Vielman, whose friends included some of the most powerful economic and political elites in the country. SEE ALSO : Guatemala Elites and Organized Crime However, over the years, most of the cases against the police and their bosses had stalled, been diverted or were archived. In some of the cases, witnesses and accused had been killed, including Rivera Azuaje, who was gunned down as he left his ministry office in March 2008. But in some cases, the CICIG persisted, reviving sometimes years old case files. This was the case in late 2018 that sent Kamilo Rivera scrambling. Shortly after he arrived to the ministry on that October morning, Rivera left the building in a white pick-up truck accompanied by another police officer. The two of them parked at a nearby McDonald's and met a third individual who arrived in a second car. Rivera drove away with the newcomer. He has not been seen since. Who's Who Conventions Indicted Fugitive Convicted Under Investigation Dead Immunity Kamilo Rivera Guatemala's former deputy interior minister, appointed in January 2018 by President Jimmy Morales. He has been a fugitive from justice since October 29, 2018, after being accused of participating in extrajudicial executions. The Attorney General's Office and CICIG have accused him of having been part of a death squad within the Guatemalan police between 2004 and 2009, known as ""Los Riverita."" Carlos Vielman Guatemala's interior minister between 2004 and 2008. CICIG investigated him in 2008 and 2009 as being the man behind police death squads. He was tried for extrajudicial executions in Spain in 2010 but eventually acquitted. CICIG and the Attorney General's Office charged him again for the same crime in October 2018, although related to different cases. Erwin Sperisen Director of Guatemala's National Civil Police (PNC) between 2004 and 2007. He was investigated by CICIG as having controlled death squads within the police. He was arrested in 2012 in Switzerland, his father's country of origin. country from which his father originated. He was tried and convicted for his role in several extrajudicial executions, although acquitted of killings which happened within the Gavilan Plan in 2005. He was sentenced to life in prison in Geneva in 2014, although this sentence was reduced to 15 years on appeal in 2018. Victor Rivera, ""Zacarias"" A former Venezuelan police officer who moved to Central America in the late 1980s. He was an adviser to police in El Salvador in the 1990s but had to flee that country after being accused of stealing ransom money from police kidnappings. In Guatemala, he gained protection and became an adviser to Carlos Vielman. CICIG and the Attorney General's Office have named him as the leader of ""Los Riverita,"" the death squad which Kamilo Rivera was a member of. Jimmy Morales President of Guatemala, whose term ends in January 2020. He has been under investigation by CICIG for potential illegal electoral financing and other crimes. The Attorney General's Office has twice sought to charge him but these efforts were rejected by his political allies in Congress. Since 2017, Morales has waged open war against CICIG, including appointing Kamilo Rivera to obstruct its efforts to investigate him. 2. Government-sanctioned Death Squads The Riveritas first graduated from the police academy as potential rising stars, according to a former public safety official who knew the Victor Rivera Azuaje group well. ""They gained the trust of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and businessmen who did not trust the police leadership in the early 2000s,"" she told InSight Crime on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Inside the government, these men replaced old military commanders, who were known more for inefficiency and corruption than for fighting the type of organized crime triggered by the end of Guatemala's civil war. To be sure, in post-war Guatemala, kidnappings were rampant, requiring less brute force and more intelligence gathering, Rivera Azuaje's world. Before working at the ministry, Rivera Azuaje, who went by various alias such as ""Zacarias"" and ""Frank,"" had spent time with numerous state intelligence agencies, including the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), according to two former Interior Ministry officials who worked alongside him at the ministry. SEE ALSO : Guatemala President Uses Interior Ministry to Weaken Anti-Graft Body Following the civil wars in Guatemala and El Salvador, Rivera Azuaje was contracted by business elites in both countries to help negotiate and resolve kidnapping cases. Even after he started working with the ministry, he continued to moonlight in the kidnap ransom and negotiation business, which would eventually lead to his own downfall. Relatives of three kidnapping victims -- two Guatemalan and one Salvadoran -- in the late 1990s and mid-2000s described alias ""Zacarias"" as an efficient investigator who introduced modern police techniques to the two Central American police forces. One relative, who spoke with InSight Crime on condition of anonymity, said that Rivera Azuaje ""succeeded very quickly, because he knew he did not have to obey the law when obtaining what a normal prosecutor would have taken months to get, such as phone records."" This remained true even after Zacarias was hired by the ministry and formed the Riveritas. The former public safety official said the business sector ""latched on"" to the Riveritas. ""They were effective because they went unpunished, even when performing operations well outside the legal boundaries,"" the official said. According to the official, the government created ""a parallel state structure that worked because of its impunity. Following the law was seen as rather unsuccessful. These were times when the Attorney General's Office did not carry out autopsies and simply trusted what police reports said."" The Cases Parlacen Case CICIG investigations in 2008 and 2009 established that the death squads embedded in the PNC and commanded by Erwin Sperisen participated in the murders of three Salvadoran deputies to the Central American Parliament, perpetrated near the Guatemalan capital in 2007, as well as in the subsequent cover-up. Boqueron Case Four police officers accused of murdering the Salvadoran deputies under the orders of Victor Hugo Soto Dieguez were detained in the prison known as El Boqueron. They were murdered only a few days after the deputies. CICIG researchers determined that Victor Rivera and his followers had participated in the operation at El Boqueron to murder the police officers, as well as in covering up the affair. Gavilan Plan In October 2018, CICIG and the Attorney General's Office revealed a plan to extrajudicially execute prisoners who had escaped from the El Infiernito prison. These two institutions accused Sperisen, Vielman, Kamilo Rivera and other members of ""Los Riverita"" of carrying out these executions. 3. Ghosts Come Back to Life On October 23, 2005, CICIG investigators say then-Interior Minister Carlos Vielman held a meeting. In the hours prior, 19 inmates had escaped from the El Infiernito prison in the city of Escuintla on Guatemala's Pacific coast. Vielman ordered they be recaptured: ""dead or alive."" Dubbed ""Plan Gavilan,"" the Riveritas led the operation. The plan was simple: the fugitives would be tracked down and, if possible, executed. The scenes of the crimes would then be modified to appear as if the prisoners had been gunned down while resisting arrest. It was to become their modus operandi over the next two years. A few months later, as Christmas approached, police located one of the fugitives, Asiel Arauz Palacios, with the help of one of Kamilo Rivera's informants. (Rivera and his partner, Stu Velasco, gave the informant a phone. The CICIG and Attorney General's Office were later able to track several calls and messages between this number and Rivera's phone. And the phone was filed as official evidence linked to seven extrajudicial executions for which charges were filed in October 2018.) And on December 20, 2005, Rivera and Velasco organized a sting to capture the fugitive. Part of it included a fake delivery of food and medicine to an internet cafe in Guatemala City where they expected the suspect to be. He was not; instead, he'd sent Adonis Asael Murillo, a young Honduran national, in his place. Rivera and Velasco, wearing hoods, got out of their car and captured Murillo who promptly gave up Arauz Palacios' whereabouts. An hour later, the two police captured Arauz Palacios. Investigators say he didn't resist. The prisoner was taken to the police headquarters Guatemala City. Then he was hauled to a highway in another area of the city where investigators say several hooded men executed him. Witnesses interviewed by the CICIG and Attorney General's Office have sworn that Kamilo Rivera was among these executioners. But he initially escaped prosecution. Following Arauz Palacios' execution, the police claimed the fugitive had opened fire, forcing officers to kill him in self-defense. And for a long time, this was the unquestioned official version. But subsequent investigations determined otherwise. Arauz Palacios was shot 12 times in the back by three different weapons. A SIG Sauer .45 caliber pistol was planted in Arauz Palacio's hand, prosecutors said. A forensic investigation, autopsy and ballistic study showed that the ""ballistic trajectories of all the injuries were from back to front and from top to bottom,"" consistent with an execution-style death, they asserted. ""Those who fired were facing the victim's back, a situation that is not feasible with a confrontation,"" they said. A day after Arauz Palacios was killed, the body of the Honduran, Murillo, was found at a farm about 30 kilometers from Guatemala City. Investigators say Rivera and Velasco murdered him. 4. The Parlacen Case In February 2007, three Salvadoran deputies from the regional, albeit largely decorative, legislative body known as the Central American Parliament (Parlacen) and their driver were murdered at a country house outside Guatemala City along the Pan-American Highway. Investigations pointed to four police officials -- not members of Riveritas, but another death squad operating inside the ministry. The theory was that they had murdered the deputies to steal drugs and cash the deputies were carrying from El Salvador. The policemen were arrested a few days later and -- after a famous (and video-taped ) interaction with Victor Rivera Azuaje in which one of them clearly threatens to out the head of the Riveritas for his own dirty deeds -- sent to El Boqueron prison. Within hours they too were dead, killed mysteriously inside the jail. Preliminary CICIG reports, which InSight Crime had access to, said that the Riveritas were involved in the killing of the policemen at El Boqueron. Later investigations re-upped on this theory, adding that Vielman and Police Chief Erwin Sperisen were also involved in what became known as the Parlacen case. (Both ex-officials have denied their involvement multiple times.) Investigators also placed Kamilo Rivera at the El Boqueron massacre and the Parlacen murder cover-up. Worries of top-level involvement spread to other countries as well. In San Salvador, InSight Crime spoke with a former high-ranking official within the government of former President Antonio Saca, who was in power when the deputies were killed. He said numerous Salvadoran officials at the time suspected the Riveritas and their bosses were behind the murders and the coverup. The United States also expressed suspicions about what happened at El Boqueron. In a confidential cable sent a few hours after the prison's massacre, then-United States ambassador to Guatemala, James Derham, informed the State Department of a possible motive for the crime: ""The fear that the alleged murderers -- the policemen -- would talk is broadly perceived as the motive for the intellectual authors of the deputies' murders to silence the murderers,"" he wrote. Vielman and Sperisen were eventually tried in another case, but Vielman, who is a Spanish national, fled to Spain before he could be tried in Guatemala. Eventually, the former minister was acquitted. For his part, Sperisen fled to Switzerland, where he was convicted and is serving a 15-year sentence under house arrest. The prosecutions set the stage for the ongoing battle between the CICIG and the country's elites and portions of its security forces. Vielman and the Riveritas were among them, and they would not sit idly while they were vilified. After Vielman left the country, the anger subsided somewhat, but it would return when CICIG tried a second time to prosecute him and many others in Guatemala. It was there that Kamilo Rivera would emerge again, this time to keep the international commission at bay. 5. Rivera vs. the CICIG On the morning of August 14, 2018, agents from the anti-impunity unit (Fiscalia Especializada Contra la Impunidad -- FECI) of the Attorney General's Office prepared to carry out a series of arrests in a major case that was culminating. The FECI is CICIG's partner in the Attorney General's Office, and the case, dubbed ""Construction and Corruption,""involved several prominent businessmen and politicians. Given the sensitivity of the case, FECI Director Juan Francisco Sandoval decided to email the Interior Ministry on August 13 to request police backup for the arrests. At first, the ministry told him the police would support him. But in reality, they stalled. Sandoval was furious but not surprised. By August 2018, the Interior Ministry had turned against the CICIG, positioning people to thwart its investigations and sting operations on a number of occasions. Among those blocking the CICIG was Kamilo Rivera who had been named deputy in January. This was not just about Rivera's past with the death squads, Rivera had a vendetta against the CICIG for more personal reasons. As part of its initial investigation into the Riveritas, the CICIG arrested Edwin Emanuel Rivera Galvez, the former second-in-command of the Riveritas and Kamilo's brother. Edwin Emanuel was eventually released on appeal and ultimately hired as the security chief of a private company harvesting African palm. Now it was time for Rivera's revenge on the CICIG. For hours, Sandoval sent repeated WhatsApp messages to the deputy minister, but Rivera stalled. At 11:25 p.m., Rivera said he did not know which officers would accompany the prosecutors, claiming that there were ""other operations planned."" Sandoval asked again at 2:51 a.m., just over an hour before the raids were set to begin. Again, Rivera answered that police officers would only be available from 7 a.m. onwards. Then, at 3:30 a.m., Rivera said in an email that police officers would not be going at all. Investigators later told InSight Crime that it had become, by then, part of a pattern. On February 7, 2018, only weeks after Rivera had become deputy minister, the ministry had tipped off a reporter about an operation to arrest a suspect in a bank fraud case. On April 12, the ministry leaked information about another operation. On April 18, the ministry withdrew police from another operation. ""The prosecutor had no choice but to request support from police stations along the route to the operation,"" said an August 2018 FECI report. Another reported incident seemed to come straight from a bad sit-com. On May 16, 2018, the Attorney General's Office requested police support for inspections by prosecutors related to a case. On the morning of May 17, however, Rivera informed prosecutors that there would be no police support due to ""technical issues."" When they asked for more information, Rivera said that the request was denied because the FECI had made the demand through an ""unofficial [email] account."" 6. 'An Honorable Employee' For a long time, Kamilo Rivera knew how to avoid being directly linked to the controversy following his brother's arrest. Silently, and with the support of allies in the private sector and the military, Rivera jumped from job to job within Guatemala's public security institutions, according to statements given to InSight Crime by former CICIG investigators. By at least 2014, he was already trying to undermine CICIG investigations. One prosecutor, for instance, said that Rivera tried to boycott the CICIG and FECI between 2014 and 2015, while he was the director of criminal investigations at the Attorney General's Office. But by late 2018, his activities as part of the Riveritas were catching up to him. On the day he escaped capture, several others were arrested, including Vielman and Velasco. They were all charged for several deaths related to the Gavilan Plan. Vielman was eventually given house arrest while he awaits trial, while the others remain in prison. Before he absconded, Rivera penned his resignation. ""I am ready to continue serving my country in whatever place it finds me,"" he wrote, ""being a good citizen, an honorable employee and always in conjunction with the law."" Rivera is still on the run. Photo: Alex Cruz/El Periodico de Guatemala. Elites and Organized Crime Featured Guatemala Infographics "	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Bolivia Defense of Legal Coca Cultivation Likely to Boost Cocaine Trade. President Evo Morales of Bolivia has again defended his administration's plans to expand legal coca cultivation, a move that aims to please some of his biggest political supporters ahead of a reelection bid even though it may increase cocaine trafficking in the country. Morales defended his decision to increase legal coca cultivation during a speech commemorating 192 years of Bolivian independence on August 6, El Diario reported. In February, the Bolivian government and coca farmers agreed to allow for 22,000 hectares of coca to be legally planted each year, up from the 12,000 hectares that had previously been permitted. Morales has said that the new limit will allow for increased exportation of coca derivatives across the region to be used in tea, toothpaste and other minor products. (Indigenous communities in South America have used coca derivatives for centuries .) But this is a very limited market, raising concerns that some of this product could be diverted to the illicit trade. Despite losing a referendum last year to run for reelection, Morales plans to run again for president in 2019 and coca growers promise to be one of his biggest support groups. Political analyst Ivan Arias wrote in El Diario that Morales is defending the increase in coca cultivation limits to help his reelection bid. While increasing legal coca cultivation may win Morales political points, it is also likely to boost cocaine production and trafficking. However, the impacts of this development on the regional cocaine trade are likely to be limited. A 2013 study found that Bolivia's legal coca market could be supplied with 14,700 hectares of coca, which means that the new limit will potentially offer more than 7,000 hectares for absorption by the illegal cocaine market. Potentially doubling or tripling the amount of coca going into the illegal market would come on the heels of the first reported growth in coca cultivation in six years in Bolivia. Coca cultivation grew 14 percent between 2015 and 2016, from 20,200 hectares to 23,100 hectares. However, the potential entry of 7,000 additional hectares of coca into the illicit market would only represent a small increase in the total amount of the crop dedicated to cocaine production on a regional scale. Colombia alone is estimated to have produced nearly 190,000 hectares of coca last year, and Peru is esimated to be home to more than 50,000 hectares. This means the 7,000 additional hectares of Bolivian production would account for less than a 3 percent increase in total cultivation in the Andes, which grows virtually all the world's coca.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Investigates both Sets of Gang Truce Negotiators. El Salvador's attorney general has confirmed that his office is investigating the actions of both sets of negotiators in the country's gang truce, suggesting there will be no more semi-official attempts at mediation with gangs under the new administration. Speaking in an interview with La Prensa Grafica , Luis Martinez said he believed the recent arrest of gang mediator Father Antonio Rodriguez would mark the beginning of revelations of illegality in the truce process set up by the priest and then-Security Minister Ricardo Perdomo, and that the investigation could extend to the role of Perdomo himself. Martinez added that his office is also looking into the initial negotiations between the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Barrio 18 gangs initiated by Perdomo's predecessor David Mungia Payes, along with former congressman Raul Mijango and Bishop Fabio Colindres, but that the investigation is taking longer as the case is ""much more complicated and runs much deeper."" Labeling the rival processes ""Hypocritical Truce 1"" and ""Hypocritical Truce 2,"" Martinez told La Prensa Grafica that both sets of negotiations were facilitated by ""people who are not transparent and sincere."" The new attorney general also condemned the results of the truce process. ""The famous truce was never in favor of the people, it was against the people,"" he said. ""[The gangs] never stopped extorting, they never ceased bringing pain and grief to our country -- and so there was a mistake there."" One of the main reasons for the breakdown of El Salvador's gang truce -- which led to a huge drop in murders after it came into force in March 2012 -- was the arrival of Ricardo Perdomo to the Security Ministry. Perdomo moved quickly to shut down channels of communication for imprisoned gang leaders and sidelined the initial negotiating team, while allowing Rodriguez, known locally as Padre Tono, to begin his own mediation process. With the incoming Salvadoran government so far publicly ambivalent on gang negotiations , the arrest of Rodriguez raised suspicions that the new administration might favor the initial negotiators in any future mediations. However, Martinez's comments suggest that the Attorney General's Office is going after all groups involved in the controversial truce process. These investigations likely spell the end of any semi-official attempts to broker agreements between the gangs. By giving unofficial backing to the initial process, the previous government was able to maintain a politically expedient distance, but left the truce in a legal gray area. Negotiators will be unlikely to get involved if they feel that they risk prosecution, leaving the government with two options; a fully official mediation process, which would be a hard sell given the unpopularity of the idea with the electorate, or abandoning all attempts to negotiate with gangs."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"How Crime Affects Mexicos Housing Prices. A new study by the Inter-American Development Bank finds that v iolence disproportionately affects the real estate value of homes in poor neighborhoods in Mexico, an illustration of how crime exacerbates wealth inequality. Crime is costly. It costs us directly, by greater public and private investments in security such as police, alarm systems, health care and prison costs, among others. It also costs us indirectly, as a result of the changes in behavior we make out of fear. In a variety of ways, crime impacts the well-being of society. But how can we measure this impact? Having a better understanding of the indirect costs of crime is critical to recognizing the impact of violence on development. In our recent publication, "" Costs of Crime and Violence in Latin America and the Caribbean, "" we evaluate the impact of homicides on housing prices in Mexico. This article originally appeared on the Inter-American Development Bank's blog Sin Miedos and has been translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission. See Spanish original article here. One of the ways to measures change in well-being is by examining how the willingness of people to pay for goods and services changes. It is believed that people are less disposed to pay for properties located in violent areas, thereby lowering the social well-being of the residents in those areas. We decided to test this hypothesis using housing prices. To do this, we used the hedonic pricing method, which estimates the economic benefits and costs of both internal and external factors affecting the overall value of an asset. In the case of properties, this would include security services, in addition to square meters. For our study, we examined the price -- in addition to other characteristics -- of more than 1.3 million apartment and house appraisals registered by Mexico's Federal Mortgage Society between 2008 and 2011, which includes information on the geographical location of the dwellings. We also collected information on homicides from the National System of Information on Health, which registers the cause of death, the date and the place it took place. Taken together, we were able to evaluate how violence affects the value of residential housing. We detected that a 100 percent increase in the homicide rate resulted in a price drop for low-income housing of between 0.9 percent and 1.2 percent, while the price in residential areas with higher standards of living was not affected. Extrapolating this data onto the national level, and considering that between 2006 and 2011 the homicide rate rose over 200 percent, these results indicate that during this period, the housing prices for the poorest families fell 2.5 percent as a result of violence. Further cross-sectional analysis found that the rise in the homicide rate has a 64 to 81 percent greater impact on the housing prices of poor families compared to non-poor families. The study also found that, although both poor and non-poor tend to change residencies more often in areas with high homicide rates, poor families do so at a 50 percent higher rate. Additionally, in poor areas where violence has been more persistent -- that is, that experienced at least a 150 percent increase in homicides between 2008 and 2011, with incremental growth during this period -- the reduction in housing prices was 40 percent greater than in poor sectors that experienced short peaks of violence. In sum, violence has had a greater effect on families with fewer resources, reducing the value of one of their most important assets: housing. Given this, then, hoping to encounter a place where they fell safer, the rise in homicides related to Mexico's drug violence has intensified migration patterns of people from poor areas because they lack the means for higher cost housing with greater protections. This study makes clear that the intangible costs of crime can exacerbate inequality and widens the poverty gap. *This article originally appeared on the Inter-American Development Bank's blog Sin Miedos and has been translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission.

"Mexicos Prisoners Face Extortion Fees to Live: Report. Prisoners in Mexico are paying enormous fees for essential needs and physical security, a news report says, highlighting the role of prisons in fueling illegal markets, corruption, and organized crime. Mexican prisoners are paying between $150 and $300 per month for basic services to survive throughout their sentences, according to the BBC. In order to receive essential human needs, including drinking water and bathing, as well as protection, prisoners across Mexico pay fees to prison guards, officials and other prisoners. In order to have a place to sleep and a blanket, for example, prisoners pay around $6. Prisoners also have to pay for every change of their sanctioned uniforms -- around $1.20 for each set. And in some prisons, inmates pay around $20 per day just to be counted on the official attendance list. Communication with the outside world is also costly and difficult, as there are fees for phone cards as well as having a cellular phone, which can cost between $90 and $121. Additionally, families have to pay for visits, including individual fees for every door they pass through. The profits from such fees are allegedly passed upwards to high-level officials, reported the BBC, although government officials deny this level of corruption. The high living expenses for inmates in Mexico reveal the poor conditions and systemic corruption that plagues prisons across Latin America. The fees demanded for basic necessities and security have created complex and profitable prison economies that involve both officials and criminals alike. These payments, for instance, implicate officials throughout the prison system in illegal markets and extortion. Concerns about corruption within Mexico's prison system has grown recently following the arrest of Celina Oseguera Parra , the former head of federal prisons, and subsequent allegations connecting top officials to the incredible escape of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman from a maximum security prison earlier this year. These fees also propel the activities of criminal organizations within and beyond the prison walls. According to a recent report from Mexico's National Commission on Human Rights ( pdf ), approximately 70 percent of Mexico's prisons are ""self-governed"" by gangs and cartels, an illicit system repeated across the region. The authority and profits gained through prison fees strengthen criminal organizations' structures within the prisons and fuel their forces in the outside world. As the BBC notes, the burden of prison fees often falls on the families of inmates. Such families, often already in socially and economically precarious positions, may be pushed further into poverty and possibly even organized crime by this system of prison extortions and predatory criminal activity."	0	1	0	0	1	0	0
"Peru Police Port Operation Shows Drug Trade Power Dynamics. A massive police operation in Peru's principal drug port, Callao, has shed light on the workings of local cocaine trafficking networks and how they relate to the international brokers that ship Peruvian product abroad. In the early hours of the morning on June 20, around 1,300 police and 60 prosecutors carried out simultaneous raids on 34 houses and seven prison cells targeting the ""Kings of Shejo Port"" (Los Reyes de Puerto Shejo), arresting at least 12 people and seizing 180 kilos of cocaine, reported El Comercio. Police investigators told La Republica that the gang worked for the Andean Cartel (Cartel Andino), a transnational cocaine mafia comprised of traffickers from Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela and Peru. According to La Republica's sources, this network is principally financed by an Ecuadorean, Pedro Bejarano Alvarado, alias ""El Patron,"" and directed by his Colombian lieutenant Carlos Ocampo. Police believe the alleged leader of the ""the Kings,"" Carlos MacDowell Villacorta, provided services to the Andean Cartel, guaranteeing the safe passage of cocaine loads through the port and onto departing cargo ships. MacDowell appears to have inherited this mantle from the Barrio Kings, headed by Gerson Galvez Calle, alias ""Caracol,"" who was arrested in Medellin, Colombia in 2016. According to some reports , MacDowell and Caracol were rivals fighting over control of Callao. However, police told La Republica that MacDowell had previously been Caracol's chief representative on the Callao streets, an account supported by InSight Crime's own investigations. The case against the kings is not limited to drug trafficking, but also involves money laundering and at least 23 murders, reported Peru21. The police operation in Callao shines a light on the drug trafficking dynamics in one of the main exit points for Peruvian cocaine. The Kings' operation illustrates how Peruvian organized crime structures remain largely low-profile and relatively small clans, often family-based, that concentrate on their own particular link in the drug trafficking chain. In coca growing regions, this may be the production of coca base, the processing of base into cocaine or its transport to dispatch points. In Callao, though, this involves the storage and consolidation of cocaine shipments, and using corrupt port contacts, or in some cases divers, to guarantee these loads make it onto cargo ships. From this point on, Peru's cocaine is in the hands of the international traffickers -- like the Kings' alleged collaborators, the Andean Cartel -- that broker deals with importers and distributors such as Mexican cartels or the Italian mafia. However, InSight Crime's investigations into the Peru drug trade revealed that such networks are often ad hoc alliances formed to move cocaine on a case-by-case basis, making it unclear whether the Andean Cartel should be considered a genuine trafficking organization or a loose network of international collaborators."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombia and Venezuela: A Shift in Security Cooperation?Venezuela and Colombia are seeking to increase security cooperation, which could have profound consequences for organized crime in the Andes. The Colombian Defense Minister, Rodrigo Rivera, met with Venezuela's Minister of Interior and Justice, Tareck El Aissami, to explore ways to enhance security cooperation along more than 1,300 miles of shared border. The ministers are looking for joint strategies to tackle the common threats of drug trafficking, kidnapping and extortion. Earlier this week Rivera called upon Colombia's neighbors to help plan a common strategy to secure the region from the activities of the criminal groups that the government calls ""BACRIMs."" Relations between Colombia and Venezuela have improved immensely since the departure of the former president, Alvaro Uribe, in August 2010. Just seven months ago Colombia brought a complaint before the Organization of American States (OAS) asserting that the Venezuelan authorities were allowing up to 1500 Colombian rebels to operate in their territory, from where they launched attacks into Colombia. President Hugo Chavez responded by severing all diplomatic ties and moving troops up to the border. Under the new detente with President Juan Manuel Santos, there are already the first signs of some real cooperation. Venezuela has deported four wanted Marxist rebels to Colombia over the last three months, and said it would not tolerate any Colombian groups or criminals using its territory. There is no doubt that rebels are still in Venezuela and use the country as a logistical base as well as a rest and recuperation area, but now they have been forced to adopt a very low profile and risk arrest from Venezuelan authorities. On the drug trafficking front, Venezuela became a haven for Colombian traffickers after Chavez faced down an attempted coup in 2002. In the aftermath the attempted coup, which the Venezuelan president insisted had U.S. support, the government refused the U.S. permission to fly over national territory, thus ending the drug flight monitoring program. In 2005 amid deteriorating relations, Venezuela refused all aid and cooperation to the DEA, effectively blinding US anti-drug efforts. The result was that Venezuela saw and still sees, an enormous amount of illegal air traffic, as cocaine loads from Colombia flit across the border, either depositing shipments for transport by road and sea, or refueling and carrying on their journeys across the Caribbean or towards West Africa and Europe. The latest report of the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) mentions how Venezuela has rapidly become a launch pad for drug shipments. Many top Colombian drug lords took up residence in Venezuela, beyond the reach of both Colombian and U.S. law enforcement agencies. Wilber Varela, alias ""Jabon,"" former head of the Rastrojos and leader of the Norte del Valle Cartel was killed in Venezuela in January 2008. Now Daniel Barrera, alias "" Loco Barrera ,"" the Comba brothers (Luis Enrique Calle Serna, alias ""Comba ,"" and Javier Antonio Calle Serna, alias "" El Doctor ""), Diego Perez Henao, alias "" Diego Rastrojo ,"" and Maximiliano Bonilla Orozco, alias "" Valenciano ,"" are all believed to spend part of their time in Venezuela. However the Venezuelans have made some very significant drug arrests. In July last year Carlos Alberto Renteria Mantilla, alias ""Beto,"" the last of the Norte Del Valle Cartel leaders still at large, was captured, with the help of British intelligence. He was extradited to the U.S. Earlier this month, Venezuelan authorities arrested a man that highly resembled Diego Perez Henao, alias ""Diego Rastrojo,"" and immediately phoned Colombian authorities to establish his identity. It was not Perez Henao, but the incident shows that the Venezuelan authorities are ready and able to cooperate. Actions against this situation may well be included in the pending anti-narcotics treaty announced on November by both heads of state. Likewise, Colombia has answered with the extradition of high-profile drug trafficker Walid Makled to Caracas, instead of sending him to Washington, as an offer of goodwill. The question is however how far this cooperation is going to go and whether it can turn into joint operations against rebels and drug traffickers. With the rebels this is unlikely as it is clear there is still a great deal of sympathy for the two main rebel groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) and the National Liberation Army ( ELN ). However on the common enemy of drug trafficking and Colombia paramilitary groups, greater cooperation is possible and probable. This could make Venezuela that bit more difficult for the cartel to operate in meaning alternate routes like Ecuador, Peru, Brazil or Panama would be considered as alternate routes to smuggle drug shipments to destinations in Europe and Central America, and of course the US.

"What Mexico Hopes to Learn from US Prisons. Faced with a fraught penal system which impedes efforts to punish criminals, Mexican authorities are looking to a New Mexico prison as a model for how to improve the nation's penitentiaries. As the magazine M Semanal recently reported , the New Mexico Penitentiary, which houses an average of 790 inmates a few miles south of Santa Fe, has turned into a model for the changes Mexican authorities are attempting to orchestrate in their own prison system. According to reporter Victor Hugo Michel: It's the model prison of the US, which through the Merida Initiative is today the subject of detailed study by the Mexican government, so as to understand how a jail can, in effect, switch from being a rotten cesspool to a world-class facility in a generation, especially given the crisis in the Mexican penitentiary system and the urgent need for results. The New Mexico facility was once an example of everything wrong with the US prison system. In 1980, it was the site of one of the worst prison riots in US history, when inmates took over the prison for two days and held several prison staffers hostage. Thirty-three inmates were killed and more than 200 injured in the incident. While the dozens of dead provoked a wave of government attention and a redoubled effort to improve the state of the prison, eight years later, the New Mexico Penitentiary once again earned headlines, this time for an prisoner escape conducted via helicopter, which landed in a prison courtyard and stole off with a small number of inmates. Such incidents are all too common in Mexican prisons. In particular, mass killings, whether through riots or through organized massacres, have occurred with far greater frequency over the last several years. The most recent such event was the February killing of 44 inmates in the Apodaca prison. This followed similar (though not quite as deadly) incidents in Juarez in 2011 , Tijuana in 2008 , Juarez in 2009 , Gomez Palacio in 2009 , Mazatlan in 2010 , and Durango in 2010. Well over 100 inmates have died in all of these incidents. Mass escapes are also quite frequent, especially in the northeastern border state of Tamaulipas, where more than half of the nation's jailbreaks occurred in 2010, including the escape of 140 inmates from a Nuevo Laredo prison that December. In at least one occasion -- the flight of more than 50 alleged Zetas from a Zacatecas prison in 2009 -- a helicopter was used to facilitate an escape. It's no wonder, then, that Mexico is looking to the revamped New Mexico prison as an example to follow. The New Mexico Pennitentiary is known for its division of different types of inmates, with six different classifications according to the danger presented by the individual prisoner. The most dangerous are kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, and they are strictly segregated from the rest of the prison population. They also have almost no contact with the outside world. On the other end of the spectrum, the well-behaved prisoners serving sentences for light crimes can spend much of their day outside of prison walls, either working or taking classes, returning to the facility each night. In doing so, not only do they better themselves, but they remain a part of the broader society even while doing time, which makes reintegration after the sentence is served far easier. ""We have presented this model to officials in the Mexican government and to various Central American countries, and they are very interested. We think this is one of the most progressive models in all of the US and it is worth analyzing"", said Colleen McCarney, director of classification in the New Mexico Department of Corrections. This stands in stark contrast to the Mexican system, where overcrowding has led to mixing criminals convicted of or awaiting trial for petty crimes, and dangerous figures linked to the most powerful organized crime groups. As a result, the non-violent nuisance crooks develop links to the worst of the worst, and jails turn into what many call ""finishing schools"" for criminals. The US prison system has served as a model for other parts of the world as well. In 2000, Colombia and the US signed the ""Program for the Improvement of the Colombian Prison System"", which provided the Colombian government with financial and technical assistance from the US Bureau of Prisons (BoP) and the US Agency for International Development. The Valledupar and Combita facilities were built and organized with the cooperation of the BoP. Today, Combita, with a capacity to house 1,600 inmates, is used exclusively for members of the BACRIM, the ""bandas criminales"" responsible for much of the nation's organized crime activities. However, in at least one sense, the US is an inappropriate model for Mexico. The US has the largest prison population in the world , both in per capita and in absolute terms. (For instance, the US has 700,000 more prisoners than China, whose population is more than four times larger, and its rate of imprisonment is almost seven times that of England.) Not surprisingly, much of the US advice to other nations appears to be how to better imprison large numbers of people. But in Mexico, where 40 percent of the prison population is awaiting trial, where a huge proportion are behind bars because they were unable to pay the small fine meted out as punishment, and where today's prison system is at roughly 25 percent over its intended capacity, building more space for new criminals is only part of the equation. To address the prison crisis, Mexico's criminal justice system also needs to drastically reduce the number of people who are liable to imprisonment. If the Mexican system as a whole can follow the path carved by the New Mexico State Penitentiary, in a generation's time, such gruesome and troubling events could turn from constant headline fodder into little more than a historical footnote.

"Latin Americas Success (and Struggles) in Fighting Human Trafficking. The majority of countries in the Western Hemisphere now have anti-human trafficking laws compliant with UN standards. But better laws mean little without more convictions for this crime. More Latin American countries than ever before have passed legislation that meets international standards for human trafficking, as highlighted in a new United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report ( pdf ). Out of the 31 countries surveyed in the Americas, 26 now have anti-human trafficking laws that are compliant with these standards. This is a stark contrast to 2003 when just three Latin American countries were compliant, as indicated in the chart below. But while Latin America may have strengthened its anti-human trafficking legislation, the region is dragging when it comes to actually convicting those found guilty of the crime. According to the UNODC, just 10 percent of all suspects investigated on human trafficking charges in the Americas were actually convicted. The only Latin American country to see more than 50 human trafficking convictions between 2010 and 2012 was Peru. During that same time period, some countries in Central America and the Caribbean failed to convict anyone. The UNODC also noted that North and Central America -- as well as parts of South America -- experienced some of the most significant increases in child trafficking worldwide during these three years. In total, children made up about 30 percent of trafficking victims in the Americas. Approximately two thirds of these child trafficking victims were female. The UNODC report also highlighted the key role of organized crime in human trafficking operations worldwide. As would be expected, transnational trafficking rings are generally orchestrated by larger, well-organized crime groups, while smaller groups or individuals tend to traffic victims at either a domestic and subregional level. Human trafficking is reportedly the third largest illicit industry in Latin America , behind drug and arms trafficking. While the passing of legislation that's more in line with international anti-human trafficking standards is a step forward, the region still needs to confront the high levels of impunity involved in these cases. As seen in countries like Colombia , where strong anti-human trafficking laws are in place, better legislation doesn't mean much if the laws aren't enforced. One reason for Latin America's poor conviction rate is official corruption, including the acceptance of bribes by border control and visa officials. Judges who are reluctant to rule in favor of victims is another issue. Nevertheless, the lack of convictions for human trafficking in Latin America isn't just because of corruption. As noted by the UN report, the lack of reliable data on what they call ""hidden populations"" makes human trafficking a difficult crime to catalog, and by extension prosecute. One notorious human trafficking case in Argentina , which saw the acquittal of all suspects in a 2012 ruling, demonstrated how a lack of physical evidence may often result in an outcome unfavorable to victims. As for the demographics that fall victim to human trafficking, the high rate of minors being trafficked in and from Central America is likely due to the escalating levels of violence in the Northern Triangle (an area that includes Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador). Gang violence has been widely credited as driving more unaccompanied child migrants out of this region, which has left children highly vulnerable to human traffickers eager to take advantage of the chaos. Latin America has recently made some other key advances in combatting human trafficking. In its 2014 Trafficking in Persons report, the US State Department lauded efforts by Chile and Honduras to invest more in anti-trafficking law enforcement personnel. Peru is expanding the number of prosecutors who specialize in investigating the crime, while in Argentina, the 2012 ruling that released all suspects in an iconic human trafficking case was reversed and resulted in the conviction of ten people."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
PCC Death Squad Stalked Police Officers in Brazil. PCC gang members in Brazil monitored police on social media and invaded their homes disguised in worker's uniforms -- in a brazen, hit-squad like attempt on their lives. The country's most notorious prison gang, First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC) was preparing to kill 12 public security officials, including police officers and prison guards, according to the civil police organized crime unit (Delegacia Especializada de Combate ao Crime Organizado - DECO). The arrest of the gang members revealed the death squad's sophisticated surveillance techniques. PCC members first gathered intelligence using open sources, like social networks, to find information about their targets, authorities said. They also monitored official webpages of the government and the state's Diario Oficial to remain up to date on officials' post transfers. The information was then sent to criminal leaders in prison. Other gang members carried out field operations. Most had debts to the PCC leadership, and the planned killings were a way to pay them off. Using the information obtained online, they surveilled the officers and their relatives, friends, and colleagues, staking out their homes and vehicles, and learning their daily routines. They even entered their targets' homes disguised as cable guys. Police suspect that the killing of a 25-year-old soldier was the first and only successful murder of the dozen planned. One of the four suspects arrested in the killing had been released from prison just three weeks earlier. The same faction of the gang also hired private detectives to monitor the routines of public servants, allowing them to execute three federal prison officers, authorities said. The revelation of a death squad-like unit inside the PCC highlights the gang's growing sophistication, and demonstrates how far its members are willing to go in their fight against the state. The PCC, formed by prisoners in the 1990s, has developed into Brazil's largest and most organized criminal structure, greatly expanding into into Paraguay and Bolivia, where it is involved in drug and arms trafficking. The criminal group's operational skill was put on display in 2017, when a squad stole $11.7 million in cash from private security company Prosegur, in a commando style heist. In the Paraguayan city of Ciudad del Este, the gang set cars ablaze, sprayed gunfire into the company headquarters, and then used explosives to blast their way into the vault containing the cash. Between 50 and 60 gang members took part in the heist before fleeing by boat back to Brazil. In 2018, authorities seized financial ledgers , detailing the gang's income streams, money laundering tactics and membership growth. According to the documents, the PCC's illicit activities could earn the group at least $100 million and perhaps up to $200 million annually. For all these reasons, InSight Crime named the PCC one of its three criminal 'winners' of 2018, calling the group one of the Americas' most important criminal structures to watch. Its recent hit squad operation lays bare why this is so.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Guatemala and the Black Market for US Weapons. The trafficking of weapons over the U.S.-Mexico border is well-documented -- lesser known but also significant is the sale of U.S. weapons to Guatemalan government contractors, which are then siphoned off to criminal groups. The Mexican government has focused much of its efforts to stop arms trafficking on the smuggling of weapons over the U.S. border. This strategy ignores other sources of weapons, and other entry points. Central America, for example, represents a major source of weapons. U.S. authorities have said that the vast majority of high-caliber, non-conventional weapons seized in Mexico come not from the U.S., but from Central American military arsenals. Guatemala is a major source country for Mexico's guns, with both weapons left over from the Cold War and ones trafficked into the country from the U.S. Many of these weapons are imported to Guatemala by government contractors, who then sell them on to private security firms. The three-stage process was described by Rafael Antonio, a retired Guatemalan military officer, in an interview with Noticias Televisa. Import : Many trafficked weapons are imported from the U.S. via government contractors. These contractors import small quantities of weapons from U.S. warehouses, and then sell them on to the government and to private security firms. Buying prices range from $700 to $1,000, and selling prices from $2,200 and $2,500. There is no control on the amount of weapons that contractors import, so, for example, if the government makes an order of 5,000 weapons, the company can legally purchase a greater amount, say 10,000, and do what they please with the surplus. Diverting weapons to the black market : Once inside the country, weapons are lightly regulated, meaning they can be sold without leaving a paper trail. Due to corruption of some public officials, many weapons are not registered to the General Directive for the Control of Weapons and Munitions (DIGECAM), according to the testimony. A middleman facilitates these business transactions through a number of front companies for armored clothing and lease/purchase of armored vehicles, and handles the paperwork for imports. Besides the lack of a legal framework for the import of weapons, the middleman also bribes state officials to turn a blind eye to transactions with third parties, sometimes criminal groups. Cross-border smuggling : Finally, the weapons are taken into Mexico; either smuggled through border crossings by the vendors, or by the buyers after being handed over close to the border. Sometimes they are transported by sea or through unofficial entry points along the border. This process is just one of the several methods used to traffic weapons in Guatemala. As with other countries in the region, institutional weakness is widespread and corruption is rampant, so it is not uncommon for criminal groups to obtain firearms from weapons caches with help from corrupt military officers. Border control Despite the amount of arms smuggled over Mexico's southern border, most of the investment in border control to counter organized crime has gone to the U.S. border, with an investment of about $287.5 million in 2009 as part of U.S.'s Merida Initative, while the southern border received only $3 million of U.S. aid that year. A recent study by the CESOP (Centro de Estudios Sociales y de Opinion Publica), a government commission tasked with diagnosing the state of the customs service in Mexico, found that customs operations are porous, run as a closed system and managed by various individual interests, and lack a proper institutional design. The report states that illicit smuggling is prevalent because of incompetence, corruption, and lack of technological infrastructure. It goes on to say that in 2006 and 2007 only 2 percent of illegal weapons (900) were confiscated at customs, while the rest (38,404) were confiscated inside the country in raids by the military. Corruption was singled out as the main problem affecting border management and the customs service. The commission claimed there had been a significant rise in the perception of corruption in the customs service, mentioning bribes and threats against customs agents by drug trafficking organizations as the most prevalent issues. Mexico could invest more in border control, but only by reforming its mafia-like customs service will it see any tangible results. This could eventually lead to a more competent border management that can reduce illicit trafficking on the south border, as well as the north. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Corrupt Police in Paraguay See Opportunity in Illegal Logging. Authorities in Paraguay have arrested more than a dozen police officers for attempting to steal confiscated wood, underscoring the attractiveness of Latin America's illegal logging industry for opportunistic corrupt law enforcement as well as criminal networks. An agent from the local prosecutor's office ordered the arrest of 15 police officers from the city of Curuguaty, in Paraguay's eastern department of Canindeyu along the country's border with Brazil, for allegedly attempting to steal illegally logged wood that had been seized in an earlier police operation, ABC Color reported. The officers allegedly contracted a truck driver to steal the wood from the police station while they were on duty, ABC Color reported. However, the individuals fled and left the truck behind after being spotted while attempting to steal the wood. The wood -- the type of which wasn't specified but came from the Campos Morombi nature reserve, which has faced serious problems with illegal logging in the past -- had been seized by Paraguay's environmental prosecutor in a previous operation. Among those arrested were the local unit's police chief and the chief of criminal investigations, according to ABC Color. The recent arrests in Paraguay highlight a perennial regional problem -- police corruption -- as well as the relatively low risks and high rewards associated with illegal logging in Latin America. Paraguay's Campos Morombi nature reserve is notorious for timber trafficking, and this is not the first time that police officers have been accused of trying to steal wood previously confiscated from loggers who illegally removed it from the reserve. Illegal logging is one of the highest-valued transnational crimes in the world. According to a 2017 report estimating the profitability of transnational crime, illegal logging is the most profitable natural resource crime and worth between $52 and $157 billion annually. Aside from the high profits, the risk is also relatively low. It isn't clear what the police intended to do with the stolen wood, but trafficked timber -- unless sold domestically -- tends to be transported via land and sea to other countries via trucks and containers. Unless authorities are properly trained to identify illegally sourced wood or counterfeit documents, which they often are not , the illegal wood can either be mixed in with legally sourced wood to make it look like the entire shipment is legal, or transported under false documents. Moreover, despite the fact that authorities in Paraguay did seize this illegal timber, a lack of personnel and resources, dysfunctional operating equipment and corruption all tend to hinder efforts to crackdown on illegal logging, making it all the more attractive for those hoping to get a cut of the profits. For example, in 2016 authorities in Paraguay's Campos Morombi nature reserve stopped performing checks at one of the roads used by traffickers transporting illegally logged wood for fear of being attacked after their unit was reduced from 15 officers to just four.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Govt Warns of Unified Super Gang: Report. El Salvador's government has reportedly warned that the MS13 and Barrio 18 are planning to unite and create a super gang, but these fears are likely unfounded. Authorities in El Salvador are on alert for the potential unification of the MS13 and Barrio 18 street gangs, reported El Universal. The unified gang structure would reportedly be dubbed ""Mara 503,"" after El Salvador's international calling code. Eugenio Chicas, the Communications Secretary for President Sanchez Ceren, identified former guerrilla leader Raul Mijango and newspaper columnist Paolo Luers as the suspected intellectual authors of the unification scheme, reported Diario1. Chicas indicated that the Attorney General's Office would be investigating any possible connection. Mijango, the chief mediator of El Salvador's gang truce signed in early 2012, has denied involvement in designing a unification strategy, but has confirmed that he believes Barrio 18 and MS 13 leaders are considering a merger. Central American police officials told El Universal they fear Barrio 18 and MS13 members in Honduras and Guatemala may emulate their Salvadoran counterparts and create united gangs in their respective countries as well. InSight Crime Analyis The exact basis for these new fears of a unified super gang is unclear, and there is little existing evidence to suggest this development is likely. Animosities between the Barrio 18 and MS13 stretch back decades, and it is difficult to envision them putting aside those differences to suddenly create a single criminal outfit. What's more, this is not the first questionable report of the Barrio 18 and MS13 working closely together. In April, police intelligence sources reportedly stated the gangs were planning a coordinated strike against the government. However, when contacted by InSight Crime, a high-level police official refuted these claims, and said an alliance between the Barrio 18 and MS13 was impossible. The warnings of a super gang should also be placed within the context of escalating tensions between the government and the street gangs. After a gang-enforced bus strike paralyzed the country's capital city for days and left at least seven transport operators dead, prosecutors announced they will pursue terrorism charges against the suspects and issued arrest warrants for hundreds of suspected gang members."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"US Unseals Latest El Chapo Indictment. US federal authorities have unsealed the latest indictment against Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman and 23 of his alleged associates -- but unless Mexican authorities plug the leaks in their forces, this is unlikely to bring the drug lord's capture any closer. Guzman was charged along with his ""co-leader"" Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias "" El Mayo ,"" and 22 others. Mark Morgan, who heads the FBI's division in El Paso, said the indictment was based on an investigation that began in 2000, not long before Guzman's escape from a Mexican prison. This indictment*focuses on the cartel's operations in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, and El Paso. According to the Associated Press (AP), US authorities say some of the 22 people indicted have been detained by authorities in Mexico, and that the US will seek their extradition. The AP notes that Sinaloa lieutenant Jose Antonio Torres Marrufo, arrested February 2012 in Mexico , was among those named. Guzman has already been indicted by courts in Arizona, San Diego, Chicago, and New York. At least one of the murder counts in the El Paso charges against Guzman and alleged co-leader Zambada Garcia could carry the death penalty. This indictment is evidence of US authorities' commitment to capturing Guzman, whose Sinaloa Cartel is among the largest drug trafficking organizations in Mexico. At least some of Guzman's lieutenants appear likely to be extradited under this indictment to face US justice, rather than the porous Mexican system. Since escaping from prison in January 2001, Guzman has proven an elusive target. There are signs that the authorities might be getting closer to the drug lord; he narrowly escaped a February 2012 raid on one of his hideouts in the Mexico resort town of Los Cabos in Baja California. This year would be an opportune time for the ruling PAN party to catch the fugitive drug lord, as it could boost their chances in the upcoming election, in which security will be a key issue. One of the main reasons that Guzman has managed to remain at large for so long is thought to be his networks of informants within the Mexican security forces, who tip him off about impending raids. For this reason, the latest indictment might not on its own do much to bring the authorities closer to capturing him. Ismael Zambada, who heads the Sinaloa Cartel alongside Guzman, is likely feeling the pressure of US efforts against the group. His brother Jesus Zambada Garcia, alias ""El Rey,"" was extradited to the US earlier this month, while his son Jesus Vicente Zambada was extradited in 2010. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Guatemala Struggles to Prosecute Extortion in Capital. A recent report on extortion in Guatemala indicates that the criminal practice is mostly an urban phenomenon perpetrated by gang members who act with little fear of consequence. The report by Movimiento Pro Justicia , an umbrella organization for civil society groups, analyzed complaints of extortion in Guatemala from 2013 through April of 2016. The study found that 10,664 complaints of extortion were filed with the Attorney General's Office, with the majority of the complaints coming from the three heavily urbanized departments of Guatemala, Mixco, and Villa Nueva. The department of Guatemala, home to the capital Guatemala City, registered 5,248 complaints, followed by Mixco with 1,391 and Villa Nueva with 1,382. Few cases result in convictions. Of 5,248 complaints registered in Guatemala City, only 517 individuals were convicted of extortion during the same time period. Accounting for approximately 49 percent of all complaints, Guatemala City provides a good example of the overall environment of impunity surrounding these crime. Even after they are arrested, the relative lack of control within prisons allows criminals to extort victims from behind bars utilizing cell phones. According to the prosecutor's office, criminals use threats or perpetrate acts of violence to intimidate victims before handing over a cell phone through which the extortion demands are delivered by a third party. Public transportation and small businesses are often the most heavily affected sectors. While gangs are often times behind extortion, there are also many cases of other groups and individuals running extortion schemes. Massive underreporting has traditionally made quantifying the crime of extortion in Guatemala difficult. The decentralized and, at times, informal network structure of gang cliques may be one reason that authorities are finding it difficult to adequately prosecute extortion with their limited budgets. SEE MORE: Guatemala News and Profiles Annual losses from extortion in Guatemala have been estimated at $61 million. Extortion is not unique to Guatemala and is pervasive in all three Northern Triangle countries, with annual losses valued at $400 million in El Salvador and $200 million in Honduras. These three countries represent the epicenter of criminal extortion in Central America. The practice has an adverse effect on the economy and degrades citizen security.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Dont Get Confused About Mexicos Death Count. And so, how is Mexico doing? Is the violence rising or falling under the current administration? We don't know, and we won't know for a number of months. 1. And we begin again with the dispute over the homicide figures. Last week, Milenio stated that in January, 957 killings were registered in the whole country, a total of 1,939 in the first two months of the current six-year term. By Reforma's count , January saw 769 homicides linked to organized crime, which places the total at 1,524 in the first two months of Pena Nieto's government. For its part, La Jornada published some mysterious data, obtained from ""federal employees that worked in the national security cabinet,"" according to which 1,758 people would have been killed in incidents related ""to disputes between criminal groups"" or in ""confrontations."" 2. Which of these numbers are correct? None. According to the Secretary General of National Public Safety (SESNSP), 1,569 previous confirmations of intentional homicide were registered in December. It is highly probable that January's number will be similar, giving an approximate total of 3,200 intentional homicides in the first two months of the current administration (we will know the precise figure in a couple of weeks when SESNSP releases January's information). 3. And how many of those 3,200 are linked to organized crime? Nobody knows and those who say they know, don't. The independent murder counts (and the official count used until a few months ago) are constructed based on inferences: they use some characteristics of the incidents or of the victims (presumed use of a firearm, messages next to the corpse, etc.) in order to suppose that a homicide could have been connected with something vague called ""organized crime."" But they are no more than that - assumptions not validated by judicial investigations which could allow the motives behind the homicides to be explained. 4. Are 3,200 homicides committed during the first two months of the current government many or few? Well, it depends what you are comparing it against : compared to the 1,799 homicides that were committed in the first two months of the government of Felipe Calderon, they are a lot. Compared to the 3,354 that were committed in December 2011 and January 2012, they represent a slight reduction (of approximately -4.5 percent). Against the peak numbers (the 4,128 registered in the period May-June 2011), they signify a drop of 22 percent (although this comparison is somewhat deceptive - see the following point). 5. But did the violence increase in December compared to November, or not? Well yes, but those types of month-to-month comparisons, crude and without any adjustments, are absurd: a) there are calendar effects that complicate the comparisons (December has more days than November, for example, b) there are seasonal effects (there are more homicides in summer than in winter and in December, the count rises as an effect of year-end festivities), and c) a few situational occurrences can shift the totals without causing changes in the underlying trend. 6. And so, how are we doing? Is violence rising or falling in the current administration? We don't know and we won't know for a number of months. Until December, it was decreasing: in 2012, the number of intentional homicides dropped 8.5 percent compared to the year before, the first decrease at an annual rate since 2007. If one takes a mobile average of three months, in December it reached the lowest level since April 2010. Will this trend continue in 2013? No idea: I'll tell you when I have the figures. 7. But in some regions the situation is getting worse, isn't it? Yes, but in others it is getting better: there is Ciudad Juarez , but likewise, there is the case of Nuevo Leon: in the fourth trimester, the number of intentional homicides decreased 48 percent with respect to the same period in 2011. In general, there are more examples of improvement than deterioration: in 2012, the number of intentional homicides decreased in 20 of 32 federal entities. 8. But what about the killing sprees? Aren't the case of Kombo Kolombia or the cascade of multiple homicides in the State of Mexico signs of an imminent explosion in the levels of violence? No: to use the terminology of Nate Silver , that is noise, not a signal. As spectacular and perturbing as they are, the massacres do not define the overall state of criminal violence in the country. Incidents involving ten or more victims are counted at a few tens each year: the grand majority of homicides have only one victim (or two at the most). 9. And what then? What do we do as more data appears? Demand the government to publish the information as quickly as possible: it is the least that can be asked of an administration that has made the reduction of violence the principal objective of its security policy.

"El Salvador Bus Extortion Doubles to $36 Mn Amid Failing Gang Truce. Extortion fees demanded by gangs from El Salvador's bus companies have doubled in the past year to $3 million per month, another sign of the problems inherent in the country's waning gang truce. According to El Diario de Hoy , extortion fees can vary, but now total approximately $36 million per year and cost companies between 10 and 25 percent of their monthly income, leaving some on the brink of collapse. Bus company owners consulted by the newspaper stated that in December the street gangs responsible for the crime imposed significant increases in extortion fees. Going to the police is of little use, as these reports are frequently relayed back to the gangs, which have been known to burn buses or issue threats as a result. ""If the transport companies report these acts to authorities, we haven't even left the meeting before the street gangs double the fee as a reprisal,"" one bus firm owner told El Diario de Hoy. Companies also face the problem of being extorted multiple times as they pass through territory dominated by different criminal groups. The case of El Salvador's bus sector adds to claims extortion -- already a major problem -- has risen in the country since the implementation of a truce between the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) street gangs in March 2012. This has also been seen in an accelerated rate of small businesses shutting down due to extortion. Bus extortion has also apparently been gaining ground since a 2012 operation that put elite security forces agents on buses to combat rampant extortion was ended a year later due to its overwhelming cost and a lack of funding. Rising extortion has been a major complaint of truce critics, who suggest increases in other serious crimes -- including disappearances -- are being ignored in the quest for homicide reduction. Amid popular concern that the gangs are the actors truly profiting from the pact, the anti-truce political opposition leads the polls for next month's elections, which are likely to result in the formal end of the truce. Extortion of bus companies and their drivers is also a major problem in other countries throughout the region, including Guatemala , Honduras , Peru and Colombia ."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Is Paraguays EPP Expanding Role in Marijuana Trade?Paraguay's main guerrilla group has displaced hundreds of Mennonite families from an area not far from strategic drug trafficking routes, suggesting the group may be seeking to increase its role in the country's booming marijuana trade. Nearly 130 families of Mennonite settlers from the rural, central department of San Pedro fled to the western department of Boqueron in order to escape threats from the Paraguayan People's Army (Ejercito del Pueblo Paraguayo - EPP), Ultima Hora reported. Mennonite settlers in Paraguay have for years faced threats from the EPP. In April 2014, EPP guerrillas kidnapped Mennonite teenager Arlan Fick before releasing him months later after his family paid a $500,000 ransom. More recently, a wave of kidnappings during the latter half of 2017 in San Pedro, including those of two more Mennonite teenagers, were attributed to the EPP. However, the Mennonite community is not the only group to be targeted by violence and kidnappings at the hands of the guerrillas. The EPP kidnapped Paraguayan police officer Edelio Morinigo in July 2014 and have still yet to release him. And in August 2016, EPP guerrillas killed eight Paraguayan soldiers after ambushing their convoy just north of San Pedro. The EPP's recent use of violence and kidnapping to exert territorial control follows a pattern of similar tactics used by other guerrilla groups in the region in the past, and may be an attempt by the group to increase its presence in a key border region critical to the marijuana trade in Paraguay, South America's foremost producer of the drug. Peru's Shining Path guerrilla group has used targeted attacks against security forces and mass kidnappings in the past to showcase their strength and maintain territorial control over key drug trafficking areas. And the now demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) -- which at one time was arguably the most important player in the global cocaine trade -- became notorious for using kidnappings as a show of strength. The EPP's use of these tactics may be an attempt to increase its presence in an area strategic to Paraguay's lucrative marijuana trade: the border town of Pedro Juan Caballero. This hotly disputed region is currently the battleground for Brazil's two largest criminal groups, the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) and First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC), as they vie for control of drug trafficking routes located there. Authorities in Paraguay have long warned of the EPP's links to drug trafficking, from serving as an "" armed wing' for drug trafficking groups to even producing their own marijuana. The department of San Pedro, where the EPP have recently been active, is not far from the town of Pedro Juan Caballero, a key drug transit point situated along the Brazilian border in neighboring Amambay. It's possible that the EPP may be trying to carve out a larger role in the marijuana trade or form an alliance with other criminal groups operating there."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Catching the Middlemen Who Fuel Organized Crime. A new report released by the International Assessment and Strategy Center (IASC) highlights the role of specialized intermediaries, many of whom have connections to several illicit groups at once, in facilitating transnational crime. The report (pdf) , entitled ""Fixers, Super Fixers and Shadow Facilitators: How Networks Connect"" is authored by IASC Senior Fellow Douglas Farah, and will be included as a chapter in a forthcoming book on global organized crime published by the Center for Complex Operations at National Defense University. In it, Farah looks beyond well-known international illegal organizations, to the networks of shadowy middlemen who make their activities possible. According to Farah, criminal and terrorist organizations that sell commodities like cocaine or illegally-mined minerals rarely have the necessary influence to access the international market on their own. Instead, they generally rely on well-connected middlemen to assist in moving the product and transferring payments. Whereas their clients may be motivated by ideology or political ambitions, these middlemen are more often driven by economic incentives, which gives them the ability to work with a diverse array of criminal groups. As Farah puts it, ""These individuals are the crucial links or bridges between different worlds that do not often overlap."" The chain outlined in the report begins with producers of illicit commodities like coca leaf growers and cocaine laboratory operators, who are frequently controlled by non-state armed groups like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ). These producers often rely on a network of local political or business elites -- whom Farah calls ""local fixers"" -- in order to move their commodity out of the area of production. But while these fixers are highly knowledgeable about the local dynamics of illicit commodity transfers, they in turn have to rely on so-called ""super fixers"" to move the product to the international market. These individuals have ties to several powerbrokers around the world, often organizing money laundering schemes and maintaining bank accounts in various countries in the region. A likely example of such an intermediary in Central America is Marllory Dadiana Chacon Rossell , who the United States government recently accused of managing a vast drug trafficking and money laundering network with operations in Honduras, Guatemala and Panama. Yet even ""super fixers"" like Chacon may not have access to the kinds of services needed by the initial producers. An even more well-connected group, referred to by Farah as ""shadow facilitators,"" often assists with the procurement of specialized weapons, counterfeiting legal documents, and using front shipping companies to transport illicit goods. A case study of this chain provided in the report which involves FARC fixers and an alleged connection to ex-Salvadoran guerrilla (and current secretary of the ruling FMLN party) Jose Luis Merino. Citing seized files found on the computer of FARC commander Luis Edgar Devia Silva, alias ""Raul Reyes,"" Farah claims there is reason to believe Merino served as a super fixer for the Colombian rebel group in the early 2000s. According to him, the Salvadoran official assisted the FARC in financial matters and offered to connect rebel leaders with Australian shadow facilitators who could provide sophisticated weapons to the group. Farah's outline of these networks provides an extremely useful framework for understanding transnational crime. As he points out, the fact that these middlemen often work with several criminal groups at once means that pursuing them could provide law enforcement with the necessary intelligence to unravel multiple illicit networks at once. At the same time, tracing illegal financial transactions often requires a significant amount of police resources and international cooperation, making these players much more difficult to catch.

"Peru Running Out of Ideas to Stop Illegal Mining in Madre de Dios. Authorities in Peru launched a large-scale operation aimed at driving out illegal gold mining and other illicit activities in the Madre de Dios region, where similar, previous operations have had little lasting effects. A force of some 1,800 police and military officers were sent to Madre de Dios -- a region of Amazon rainforest bordering Brazil and Bolivia -- to take part in Operation Mercurio 2019, El Comercio reported. The operation seeks to remove more than 5,000 illegal miners and evict thousands of merchants that capitalize on other criminal activities in the area, such as sex trafficking. Already 40 women considered to be trafficking victims have been rescued , according to a local news report. Authorities have also dismantled about 30 illegal mining camps in the area during the first week of the operation. The second phase of the operation will last 180 days, during which three military bases will be installed. Each base will staff 100 soldiers from the army's newly created Amazon Protection Brigade, as well as 50 police officers. The first base has been set up in the zone of ""La Pampa,"" government officials said in a news release on March 5. The government of Peru has dedicated $60 million dollars to the operation, which also plans to formalize and reintegrate illegal miners. Peru's recent assault on illegal gold mining in Madre De Dios is just the latest in a string of similar operations that have failed to stop the practice's expansion. In 2014, police raided the town of Huepetuhe, destroying $20 million worth of mining equipment. Then in 2017, officers destroyed 83 mining camps in an operation also dubbed Mercurio. Yet from to 2009 to 2017, the Madre Dios region saw more than 64,000 hectares of Amazon forest destroyed by illegal mining and logging. In 2018, deforestation from wildcat gold mining, which strips the land and leaves behind pools of mercury, peaked at nearly 10,000 hectares. Stopping the illegal gold trade in Peru has proven to be nearly impossible. The gold ore is easily bought and sold by a network of middlemen, known as ""acopiadores,"" who also provide false receipts, allowing large-scale buyers and export companies to buy the ore, which is then refined abroad. Six years ago, Peru's illegal gold trade was estimated to be worth more than $3 billion , and it has likely only grown since then. Illegal gold mining also brings with it a number of other criminal activities, such as forced labor. The mining sites have also long been hotbeds for human trafficking and prostitution. Peru's government has tried to toughen illegal mining laws, declaring it an organized crime activity , and it has attempted to formalize the industry, by offering incentives to illegal miners to register with the government. Mostly, though, it has tried to drive out illegal miners through police and military operations, of which ""Mercurio 2019"" is the latest example. But it's unlikely that the miners will stay away for long."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"El Salvador Denies Negotiating with Gangs. El Salvador's government has denied reports that it made a deal to give imprisoned gang bosses better living conditions in exchange for a reduction in violence. Last week, El Faro reported that, according to its sources, the transfer of 30 gang members from a maximum security prison to lower security facilities was part of a government deal to bring down rates of violence. The transfers took place between March 9 and 11. El Faro spoke to a gang member on the outside who received an order on March 10 to keep violence to a minimum, as their side of the bargain. He immediately called his men to cancel two murders that had been planned for later that day. Some of El Faro's sources suggested that payments had also been made to the gang bosses. In the seven days following the transfer there were a total of 44 murders, averaging just over six a day. This constitutes a drop of 53 percent from the first 12 weeks of the year, according to El Faro. Defense Minister David Munguia called a news conference on Friday to deny El Faro's allegations. ""I want the following statement to be loud and clear the government of the republic is not at any time negotiating with any gang,"" he declared. He said that the only relation the government has with the gangs is through the operations they launch against these groups. Munguia claimed that the prisoners were moved for three reasons. He said that Bishop Fabio Colindres had appealed for some to be transferred on humanitarian grounds; that the government had detected an escape plot to blow holes through the walls of the prison using anti-tank weapons purchased in Honduras; and that the prisoners had already served the required 10 percent of their sentences in maximum security jails. The minister's explanations for the transfer seem dubious. As El Faro reports, the bishop sent a Tweet after the speech that contradicted Munguia's words. ""Monsenor Fabio Colindres says that he advocates, in general, on behalf of the prisoners of Zacatecoluca [the maximum security facility the prisoners were transferred from] and not on behalf of specific cases, as Minister Munguia Payes says."" The second part of his explanation also seems unlikely. If inmates had launched a credible escape plot that involved shipping heavy weaponry from Honduras, it would seem like a bad idea to respond by moving them to lower security prisons. The third point has also been questioned. La Prensa Grafica pointed out that 10 percent is the minimum, not the maximum, proportion of the sentence to be served in a maximum security facility, and asserted that some of the prisoners had not served this much of their sentence. Another questionable point made by Munguia, when asked whether the transferred prisoners were bosses of Mara Salvatrucha ( MS-13 ) and Barrio-18 , was that these gangs replace leaders who are sent to prison. This goes against much of what is known of the workings of these organizations, who use prisons as bases of operations, to regroup and recruit members. The government has previously said that 80 percent of all extortion cases are operated from El Salvador's prisons using cell phones. Indeed, in January deputy police chief Howard Cotto told the media that jailed gang bosses were masterminding a nationwide plot, instructing their subordinates on the outside to murder members of the security forces. One reason that Munguia might be willing to negotiate with gang members, even against the stated policy of the government, is that he has staked his position on bringing the murder rate down by 30 percent. He took office in November, and promised that he would resign if he did not reach the target within a year. The first two months of 2012 saw a spike in murders, which Munguia attributed to a backlash against his tough anti-gang policies. Now, he is attributing March's drop in violence to these same policies, which include more police presence in gang areas. However, Munguia's main innovation, a new anti-gang police unit , still has not come into effect. He said it would begin operations after Easter. By then, there will be more evidence to judge whether the cut in violence this month can be sustained. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"The Mara Women: Gender Roles in CentAm Street Gangs. A study of gender roles in Central America's ""maras"" sheds light on the dual role of women, who are simultaneously violently exploited and heavily relied on by male gang members. The study ""Violent and Abused"", a joint initiative between several non-governmental organizations, examines the disempowered but crucial role of women in the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) street gangs in the Northern Triangle countries, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Read the full report here [ pdf ] Women, according to the study, serve a dual role in gangs. They are expected to take on male-associated characteristics and tasks, including perpetrating and withstanding violence and wearing men's clothing, and to act in the ""female"" role of cooking and caring for the men, children and the sick. Because gangs believe women are less suspicious in the eyes of authorities, they are also often tasked with acting as drug ""mules,"" smuggling illicit goods into jails, gathering intelligence on rival gangs, and carrying arms in public spaces. The unequal treatment of women is seen in gang initiation practices. While men are subjected to a beating, women are given the choice between this and sustaining sexual relations with multiple gang members for an equivalent length of time, but they are later harassed if they choose the second option. Women who join gangs because they are dating a gang member, meanwhile, get an automatic in and are treated respectfully by the rest of the gang. However, they are expected to tolerate frequent infidelity from their partner and if they reciprocate the practice, they may be killed. A woman who tries to leave a gang experiences similar difficulties as male gang members, as this offense can be punishable by death. Reasons for wanting to leave, however, often differ -- some women interviewed said they were pregnant and wanted to be able to offer a different life for their child. If a woman does manage to leave the gang, she can rarely escape her gang identity. In addition to harassment from her former companions, she is likely to be socially excluded on the outside and to receive little help reintegrating into society. Central America's Northern Triangle has become one of the most dangerous places in the world for women, a phenomenon that has risen in tandem with the region's growing importance to drug trafficking. Many femicides -- targeted murders of women -- are attributed to gangs. As of 2012, El Salvador had the highest femicide rate in the world. According to the country's former security minister, the rise in femicides coincided with the increasing entry of women into gangs. In Honduras, gender specialists reported in 2010 that girlfriends and mothers of gang members were increasingly being murdered in acts of revenge. Despite the dangers inherent in associating with gangs, a significant number of women opt for this lifestyle. A 2012 study in Honduras found that women made up 20 percent of gang membership, with nearly all of these connected to the MS13 or Barrio 18 -- 52 percent and 45 percent, respectively. In Guatemala, the number of female prisoners has doubled in the past eight years , which experts say is connected to their increased role in criminal groups, which they are often drawn into through family or romantic ties. Though women are often under-valued by male gang members, the study and other reports make it clear that they are important assets to the groups, doing a lot of the ""dirty work"" and therefore taking many of the risks. In addition to serving as drug mules and smuggling other illicit goods, women in Guatemala have been reported to play another important role -- gathering intelligence for extortion gangs. There are some signs that women's roles in organized crime are evolving. In Guatemala, officials said the rising number of imprisoned women were increasingly taking on work as assassins and thieves. In Mexico, which saw a 400 percent increase in the number of women jailed in relation to drug trafficking between 2007 and 2010, women are moving even higher up the organized crime hierarchy. In 2012, the army reported that women were occupying increasingly important positions in the Gulf Cartel, both carrying out assassinations and doing management and administration work. While the study deals with gender relations, it is also indicative of gang culture as a whole, and the extent to which it relies on the propagation and perpetuation of violence. As shown by these women's experiences, changing gang culture is not easy. For for those involved in it -- both male and female -- leaving it behind can be just as tough."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Most Mexicans Think Police Controlled by Org Crime: Poll. A recent opinion poll in Mexico reveals an embarrassing lack of public trust in security forces, exemplifying yet again how institutional failures risk boosting support for problematic responses to insecurity such as the militarization of citizen safety initiatives and the formation of self-defense movements. The Social Studies and Public Opinion Center (Centro de Estudios Sociales y de Opinion Publica - CESOP) of Mexico's Chamber of Deputies has published a survey in which Mexico's marines and armed forces were the highest-rated public security institutions, while municipal police forces ranked the lowest. Two-thirds of respondents said they believe that police are very or reasonably ""controlled by organized crime,"" while over 36 percent believe that authorities participate in criminal activities. A quarter of those surveyed affirmed they would not report a crime due to lack of trust in authorities. Moreover, 56 percent of those surveyed thought that corruption was the main affliction of police bodies, while over 66 percent stated there was little to no chance of ending corruption in the country. When asked what strategy would best improve citizen trust in the police, a plurality of those surveyed -- 29 percent -- chose militarization, 28 percent opted for vetting procedures, and over a fifth of people preferred a total overhaul of the police force. Over half of people approved of Mexican citizens forming self-defense groups. However, these civilian forces received a lower vote of confidence than state forces when it came to providing local security. As similar surveys have indicated in the past, Mexican authorities -- and particularly the local police -- suffer from a severe lack of public trust. This erosion of confidence has been exacerbated by extreme cases of police collusion with organized crime and widespread incompetence. There have been serious consequences to the reputation of the police compared to their military counterparts, which despite also seeing their approval ratings drop over the past decade , remain the public's preferred force for combating organized crime. This has helped prop up the highly militarized internal security strategy consolidated by President Felipe Calderon in 2006, which has been linked to a host of human rights abuses and generally lackluster results in terms of improving security. Another result of official abuses and public distrust of security institutions is, as the recent survey shows, heightened support for civilians taking security matters into their own hands. As Mexico's organized crime landscape descends into chaos and its homicide rate spirals out of control, it is likely that the country will see more self-defense groups gain in strength, a prospect that could generate problems of its own in the long term."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Central America Plans to Share Criminal Records Across Borders. The governments of Central America and the Dominican Republic are planning measures to share information on criminal records and allow ""hot pursuit"" chases across borders, in an effort to fight transnational criminal groups. Designed to target organized crime groups, the agreement will allow law enforcement agencies from one country to pursue suspects over the border into a neighboring another country. The agreement will also see states share criminal records so suspects are prosecuted as repeat offenders for crimes they have committed in other countries. Representatives of the governments agreed on the wording of the deal at a conference in Panama last week, reported EFE. Once the agreement is signed by justice ministers from each country, it will be taken to the mid-2013 Central American Integration System's (SICA) annual summit for signature by the presidents. Weak law enforcement cooperation between countries and lack of border controls has helped make Central America an attractive venue for organized crime with criminals able to move quickly into the next country in order to escape pursuit by the law. One example is offered by the case of Jose Natividad Luna Pereira, or ""Chepe Luna,"" a Salvadoran drug trafficker who in recent years has been hiding out in Honduras , where he also holds citizenship, after a series of failed police operations to capture him in El Salvador. Those that do get caught may get away with relativly light sentences despite a long criminal history if it is their first offence in the country where they are arrested. Free movement policies, like the Central America-4 (CA-4) Border Control Agreement, have also made it easier for criminals to do business between El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. The Central American Parliament, which oversees SICA, has plans to expand the Central American Court of Justice to further coordinate law enforcement efforts in the region, currently a major corridor for trafficking drugs from South America up to Mexico and the United States. The case of Facundo Cabral , an Argentine folk singer murdered in Guatemala in 2011, has also drawn attention to the importance of cooperation in the region. Costa Rican Alejandro Jimenez, alias ""El Palidejo,"" allegedly ordered the hit, which was intended to kill Nicaraguan nightclub owner Henry Farinas. Authorities in all three countries have been cooperating in the case, which has also led to arrests in Colombia."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"US Easing of Gun Export Controls Could Send New Wave of Arms to LatAm. US President Donald Trump has proposed a new reform that would ease firearm export controls for US weapons manufacturers, which could increase the already high number of US-sourced firearms used in criminal activities in Latin America. The proposal , published May 14, would shift authority to regulate exports of certain firearms and related products from the State Department to the Commerce Department. The move aims to streamline the approval process for arms exports so US manufacturers -- suffering from decreased domestic sales in the Trump era -- can sell more guns, ammunition and accessories abroad. ""There will be more leeway to do arms sales,"" a senior administration official told Reuters last year when the plan was first floated unofficially. ""You could really turn the spigot on if you do it the right way."" The rule would apply to ""commercial items widely available in [US] retail outlets and less sensitive military items,"" the proposal states. That definition would cover products like assault-type rifles, military-grade sniper scopes, armor-piercing ammunition and most handguns. While many in Congress support the move, several powerful Senators have vowed to fight it. In a joint press release , the human rights organization Global Exchange and the Violence Policy Center, a pro-gun control group, slammed the proposal, saying it ""will likely lead to more US guns getting into the hands of criminal organizations, human rights abusers, terrorist groups, and others who wreak harm."" Indeed, US-sourced guns play a major role in fueling criminal violence in Latin America and the Caribbean. Data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) consistently shows that a large percentage of firearms seized in Central America and the Caribbean can be traced back to the United States. And a majority of murders in the world's most homicidal region involve the use of a gun. The new export rules are likely to affect many countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. But due to its proximity to the United States and other factors , Mexico is likely to see a significant impact. InSight Crime spoke with researcher and activist John Lindsay-Poland of Global Exchange about the flow of US firearms to Mexico, the role these firearms play in rising levels of violence and the potential effects that the proposed reform might have on these dynamics.* InSight Crime (IC): American guns have for years been flowing into Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. Can you give us some background on this and some context for the recent focus on this dynamic as of late? John Lindsay-Poland (JLP): It's true, US weapons have been flowing into Mexico and other countries both legally and illegally for many years. The end of the assault weapons ban in 2004 created even greater conditions to obtain firearms that are of a special interest to organized criminal groups in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. The structure of the US-Mexico border is such that most controls are on the south-to-north trafficking route, under the idea, in the United States, that the threat is in Mexico. I think that corresponds to an American exceptionalism idea that [the United States] cannot pose a threat. The infrastructure does not control very well for weapons that are going north to south. When the drug war in Mexico heated up, the market conditions were great both on the supply and demand side for an increased flow of military-grade weaponry. The drug war becomes helpful to the gun industry because the premise of the drug war is that the United States and its allies are going to fight drug trafficking through military and policing means, so therefore they're going to be armed. The collusion of these forces with organized crime is overlooked in the interest of that market. IC: Two of the US agencies primarily responsible for combating cross-border arms trafficking are the ATF and the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Have these agencies collaborated effectively or been given the proper resources to stem the flow of US firearms to Mexico? JLP: There's a US Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that says they were not collaborating effectively. I don't know this from my own fieldwork, but I would take the GAO's word for it. The ATF has been hobbled by congressional restrictions as a result of the gun industry's lobbying that has prevented it from having a permanent director for years, the resources and the legislation. The fact that international gun trafficking has not been a federal crime in itself is also an indicator of the lack of resources that the agency has. Because the US prioritizes commerce, the effort to try to stop physical things from going over the border is never going to be successful. There will be people who are caught and weapons that are seized, and that's a good thing, but any successful effort has to go further upstream to the production and marketing of weapons, as well as the policies and laws related to that, in order to stop the flow. IC: How effective have Mexican authorities been in stemming the flow of US weapons south to Mexico? JLP: Not effective. A 2013 study from the University of San Diego estimated that 250,000 firearms purchased in the United States are trafficked into Mexico each year. The number of firearms recovered at crime scenes has gone down in recent years. It's unclear exactly why, but the incentives within the Mexican police and armed forces are not strong enough to go after weapons. There are incentives to go after drugs, but there's also of course extensive collusion between police and military forces and organized crime, so that I think is also undermining efforts to recover weapons. Mexico can work with the United States to strengthen enforcement and market controls on the US side of the border. The other thing is that the approach to security and to drug trafficking in Mexico is supported by the United States, which is reinforcing a kind of arms race between criminal groups and the state. If criminal groups get more weaponry, police get more weaponry, and if police get more weaponry, criminal groups get more weaponry. IC: Do you think the flow of US firearms to Mexico is used to explain the high levels of violence we're seeing in Mexico as opposed to flawed security strategies or more structural issues? JLP: I would definitely affirm that the flow of US guns has contributed to homicides in Mexico. If you look, for example, at the percentage of homicides committed with firearms, it goes up. In the early 2000s, one in four homicides were committed with firearms. In the US context, people expect murders to be committed with guns because that's been a long-term trend within the United States. In Mexico that wasn't always the case. The gun-related homicides are going up and the reason they're able to go up is that there are more guns. That's not the only reason, but it is one. Since most of those guns are coming from the United States, illegally or legally, of course the United States has a role. IC: With growing support for stricter gun control in the United States, is there any chance we'll see a decrease in the number of US guns in route to Mexico? JLP: I think there is an opening now. The gun violence prevention movement in the United States has been very focused on crimes committed with guns in the United States, and generally has not been aware of how US-sourced guns are being used outside our borders. So that is an important piece of trying to have an impact in Mexico or in other countries. ""The approach to security and to drug trafficking in Mexico is supported by the United States, which is reinforcing a kind of arms race between criminal groups and the state."" That said, if there were a new assault weapons ban, it would have an impact in Mexico, even if the ban is done without the awareness of the impact in Mexico. When the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004, California retained an assault weapons ban. Mexican communities on the other side of the border from Texas, Arizona and New Mexico saw a much greater increase in gun deaths after the expiration of the federal assault weapons ban than Mexican communities on the other side of the border from California. There is interest now in Mexico in increased work around guns both within the country and bilaterally. I think there is increased interest in how to create more awareness that could lead to policy changes that would have an impact on the guns coming into Mexico. But there's a long way to go. IC: In a recent article you wrote for Al Jazeera , you argued that the United States should ""suspend gun export licenses to Mexico and reorient its security policy there."" Can you explain your reasoning? JLP: We call for a suspension of firearms licenses to Mexico because under the current system, there is no adequate end-use control mechanism for legally exported weapons to Mexico from the United States. When a gun producer goes to the US State Department to seek an export license, it has to name the end users. Now in Mexico, only the Mexican military is legally permitted to import firearms. And they're also the only legal distributor within Mexico, including to the police. All police weapons in Mexico come through the Mexican military, which produces them themselves, although this is a very small portion, or they import them. About two-thirds of the weapons that they have imported have gone outside Mexico City. However, when the license comes before the State Department, 80 percent of those applications, according to a State Department source who I spoke with, said that they name the end users as within Mexico City, the military or police within Mexico City, when we know that most are being distributed outside the capital to police forces around the country. The US State Department is not getting sufficient information about who the end users really are, which means that they cannot under the current system exclude police forces that have committed severe human rights abuses or colluded with organized crime from getting US-sourced firearms. It's important that the State Department suspends those licenses and creates a system with end-use controls that allows them to know where the end users are and who they are. IC: How will the Trump administration's proposal affect levels of violence in Mexico? JLP: We can expect even less oversight on end users of US guns, so more weapons going to police and military units that Washington knows are colluding with organized crime, have ""lost"" weapons, or have committed serious human rights abuses. That further erodes the rule of law and makes conflicts over territory and business even more violent. * This transcript was edited for clarity and length."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Suspends Ex-Police Directors Implicated in Drug Czar Murder. Authorities in Honduras have suspended two former national police directors as well as 25 officers for their alleged involvement in the murder of the country's anti-drug czar in an investigation that threatens to expose the extent of state collusion with organized crime. In an April 21 press release , a special commission set up to purge corrupt officers from Honduras' National Police ordered the suspension of two former police directors, Ricardo Ramirez del Cid and Ramon Sabillon, while they are investigated for the 2009 assassination of General Julian Aristides Gonzalez, who at the time was the country's top anti-drug official. That same day, current National Police Director Felix Villanueva informed the special commission that 25 officers implicated in the scandal had also been suspended, reported La Prensa. The suspensions follow a report last week by the New York Times , which was based on documents from Honduras' Inspector General's Office of the Security Ministry that named top ranking police officials allegedly involved in the murder. According to the documents obtained by the Times, Ramirez del Cid and another ex-police director, Jose Luis Munoz Licona, organized the killing of Aristides Gonzalez in 2009 and Gonzalez's one-time adviser Alfredo Landaverde two years later. The police directors, as well as the 25 officers who were recently suspended, are being investigated for allegedly working for a criminal organization known as the Atlantic Cartel. The cartel was allegedly led by a man named Wilter Blanco. Investigators believe Blanco ordered the assassination of Aristides Gonzalez as payback for thwarting an attempt by the drug trafficker to have police steal a cocaine shipment some five months earlier. Following the Times report, both Ramirez del Cid and Munoz Licona denied involvement in the murders. Although the investigation has already reached into the upper echelons of the Honduran police, it is unlikely to stop there. As the New York Times points out , the official documents suggest a systematic cover-up that transpired over the course of several years and included government officials outside the police ranks. ""There was a type of pact of silence,"" Honduran journalist Thelma Mejia told the Times. ""These files passed through various police chiefs and they did nothing. They were known by various security ministers and they did nothing."" A potential wildcard in the ongoing investigations are the Honduran drug traffickers currently in US custody. Several Honduran drug capos have either been extradited or have handed themselves over to US authorities in the last few years, and they could be providing information on corrupt officials. Among those in US custody are the heads of the Cachiros drug trafficking organization, who were known to have contacts in the military and police prior to their arrests. These individuals may be a particularly illuminating source of information for US officials with regards to the current case -- a Honduran law enforcement official told InSight Crime that Winter Blanco was believed to have been working for the Cachiros at the time of Aristides Gonzalez's murder. The official added that Blanco is thought to be operating in the Mosquitia region on Honduras ' remote northeastern coast, an area once controlled by the Cachiros. At the request of the special commission on police reform, the US Embassy in Honduras recently shared information it has gathered on corruption and human rights abuses within the police ranks and any further intelligence obtained by US authorities may well also be passed on to their Honduran counterparts.

"Guatemala Arrests Show Something is Working. With a recent series of high profile arrests, Guatemala 's authorities, under the leadership of a new attorney general, are beginning to show their teeth. But while initial results have been positive, treacherous times await. Just three days after the murder of Argentine folk singer Facundo Cabral, who was shot dead on July 9 while driving to Guatemala City airport , the government announced it had arrested three suspects. Cabral was being driven by a business associate, Nicaraguan night club owner Henry Farinas, who was badly injured in the attack. Authorities say Farinas was the target of the multiple gunmen, who had been tracking him since the previous day. The three suspects were part of a Guatemalan criminal network, but authorities said that they had been contracted by a group based in another Central American nation. Farinas owns strip clubs in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. This swift action is stunning for a country that has grown accustomed to high levels of crime which normally go unresolved and unpunished. Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz said the government had analyzed and processed information from security cameras, fingerprints, and old case files that connected the group to a car theft ring that doubles as an assassin network. The Public Ministry and police said they had worked closely with the United Nations' Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad in Guatemala - CICIG ). Perhaps to dispel any doubts about their quick judgement, the Government Ministry posted a detailed and chilling blow-by-blow account of the crime (See slideshow below, with InSight Crime's narration). The arrests came just hours after another operation, less celebrated but equally stunning, which resulted in the arrest of several members of an organized criminal group which operates in close association with Mexican drug gang the Zetas. Kevin Saul Overdick, who one newspaper identified as the son of kingpin Walter Overdick , was taken into custody along with five other alleged members of Overdick group, one of the most powerful Guatemalan criminal enterprises. They were preparing for what authorities called a ""narco-fiesta"" of horse races, cockfights and beer in the northern municipality of Ixcan, close to the Mexican border. As InSight Crime details in a report to be released in the coming weeks, Overdick's organization provides logistical support and financial infrastructure for the Zetas. It also moves tons of cocaine through the eastern and northern part of the country on its way to the United States. On Sunday, authorities captured five members of a different branch of the Overdick organization, including its leader Amner Millan Quijada, also in Ixcan. Millan Quijada runs a logistics group based in Coban that locals refer to as the ""Chulamicos."" This success follows more than 40 arrests connected to the Zetas' brutal massacre of 27 farmworkers in May and murder of a Coban prosecutor days later, and the capture of three suspects in the unrelated murder of two mayoral candidates on the outskirts of the city. With these operations, the government has shown itself both capable and willing to take action. This turnaround follows the inauguration of Claudia Paz y Paz as attorney general in December 2010. International and local analysts told InSight Crime that Paz y Paz is working hard to change the culture of an institution whose failures lie at the heart of the country's near 98 percent impunity rate. The new attorney general has the right resume. She is a doctorate in human rights and criminal law. She worked with the storied human rights section of the archbishop's office in the early 1990s, which later produced a damning report about the country's war, placing most of the blame on the military for countless abuses and extrajudicial executions. She also worked on the famous ""Dos Erres"" case, in which over 250 people were massacred by special forces from the Guatemalan army in 1982 ( click here for pdf version of summary and resolution of case ). The Inter-American Court of Human Rights condemned the state for the massacre in 2009. But whether Paz y Paz's resolve, and the recent encouraging results, will translate into profound changes for the country remains to be seen, and may not depend wholly on her. The Alvaro Colom administration has put other capable and powerful personalities in important positions, only to let them drown in the political cesspool that surrounds them -- most notably Helen Mack, the combative founder of the Myrna Mack Foundation. Named after her slain sister, the foundation did more to break the invisible but formidable wall of impunity protecting the military and its operatives than any other Guatemalan non-governmental organization in the last 20 years. But since being called on to run the police reform commission, Mack has been frustrated, isolated and largely ineffective. Colom is also enmeshed in a political struggle that may subsume all reform efforts. His ex-wife, Sandra Torres, who divorced him to be eligible to run for president, is now facing the possibility that the courts will block her candidacy for the September 11 elections. Torres is already lagging in the polls behind a former military officer, Otto Perez Molina, whose possible connections to human rights abuses during the war and current political connections make it clear that he would remove Paz y Paz as soon as he took office. But no matter what happens to the current attorney general, in her short time in office Paz y Paz has shown Guatemalans that change is possible, and that there are dedicated and determined officials in the Public Ministry. In other words, she has been a ray of light in a dark situation. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Guatemala Short on Guns for New Police Graduates. Guatemala does not have enough guns to arm the latest crop of police graduates, pointing to the financial factors holding back the reform and expansion of the force. Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla said that the authorities were trying to find guns to equip 1,503 new police agents who graduated on August 1. He suggested that they could share guns with off-duty police, and said that there would be enough guns once repairs had been made to some broken ones, reported Siglo 21. Lopez also said that most of the new officers would be deployed in Guatemala City and in the province of Escuintla, in the south of the country, where crime has been on the rise. On the same day, the authorities opened the new Officer Training School, which police reform commissioner Adela Camacho said was ""the first step to professionalize the institution,"" as Siglo 21 reported. Colombia police helped the Guatemalan force to design the training school. The course will take a year, and the first group will be 80 existing police officers. Camacho also announced that universities around the country would begin offering a degree in police management. The opening of the new officers school is a success for President Otto Perez, who had promised to set up the facility early in his administration. A recent International Crisis Group report on police reform pointed out that the lack of such a school was one of the things holding back the professionalization of the force, as those promoted to officer often received little extra training. This means the police are short on qualified leadership. Crisis Group recommended the training of more supervising officers as a key part of combating corruption in the force. However, despite the advance represented by the new school, the fact that a crop of new police agents do not have guns points to the financial constraints facing the authorities in carrying out police reform. Perez has promised to add 10,000 new officers to the police, but they will not be effective without the resources to train and equip them properly. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Former FARC Guerrillas Recognized as Victims of Sexual Violence in Colombia. A recent court decision recognizing acts of sexual violence that took place within the FARC during the armed conflict in Colombia has set a welcome precedent regarding the roles of former female combatants within the armed group. On December 11, Colombia's Constitutional Court issued a sentence that recognizes Helena, a woman forcibly recruited by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) at the age of 14 and later forced to have an abortion, as a victim of the armed conflict. Helena's name was changed to protect her identity. According to Women's Link Worldwide, an organization that defends the rights of women and children and was responsible for bringing the case to court, Helena was forced to take anti-contraceptive injections over the greater part of her time with the guerrilla group. But she still got pregnant as the result of a consensual relationship. SEE ALSO : Colombia News and Profile According to her testimony, when she pleaded with commanders to be allowed to have her child, they threatened to execute her by firing squad. Helena underwent the abortion against her will and in poor sanitary conditions. Her testimony has revealed how she continues to suffer from the serious physical and psychological consequences of the procedure to date. The Court ordered Helena to receive specialized medical assistance in addition to being included on Colombia's National Victims Registry, guaranteeing her access to reparations provided for by the 2011 Victims Law. Helena's case is one of 35 victim testimonies recounting instances of reproductive violence that are currently being reviewed by the JEP. The FARC saw pregnancies as being incompatible with the guerrilla lifestyle and birth control measures were mandatory for female members after the Eighth Guerrillero Conference held in 1993. The court's ruling has brought the violations of women's sexual and reproductive rights committed by the FARC to the center of Colombia's post-conflict debate. Additionally, it sets an international benchmark for the recognition of such violence suffered by women and girls within armed groups. Instances of sexual and reproductive violence within the FARC have been underreported, some estimates hint to the magnitude of the problem. According to internal FARC documents seen by the newspaper El Espectador in 2013 , about 1,000 abortions were conducted within the guerrilla each year. Since the peace agreement of 2016, reports of sexual and reproductive violence within the FARC's ranks have increased. Women's Link Worldwide has defended several of these cases before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace ( Jurisdiccion Especial para la Paz - JEP) , the entity created by the Colombian government and the FARC to administer transitional justice and to recognize the crimes committed within the framework of the armed conflict. According to the plaintiffs, the court ruling in Helena's case represents a victory for the restitution of rights for many female former combatants who were forcibly recruited and violated of their reproductive rights. Before this court decision, the cases of these women were in judicial limbo , as they ""were excluded from receiving reparations under the Victims' Law for having demobilized or fled the FARC at a legal age, and had no other way of receiving reparations,"" stated Mariana Ardila, a lawyer from Women's Link. This case clarifies that having been part of a guerrilla group or having participated in criminal acts does not deprive these women of seeking and receiving reparations for acts of physical, sexual and emotional violence against them."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Latin America Media Giants Implicated in FIFA Corruption Scandal. Testimony in an ongoing trial in a US court has implicated two of Latin America's biggest media companies in the wide-ranging FIFA corruption scandal, highlighting the potential for new revelations about the case to hit other powerful actors in the region. The former CEO of Argentine sports communications firm Torneos y Competencias, Alejandro Burzaco, testified that Mexico's Televisa and Brazil's Globo mass media companies coordinated with his company to pay multimillion-dollar bribes to executives of the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) in order to secure media rights for the 2026 and 2030 World Cup tournaments, Reuters reported on November 15. According to Burzaco, the companies paid a $15 million bribe to the late FIFA executive Julio Humberto Grondona at a 2013 meeting in Zurich, Switzerland to secure the lucrative broadcasting rights, ESPN FC reported. Burzaco also testified that Fox Sports, a division of the US-based media conglomerate 21st Century Fox, was involved in a similar, but separate bribe scheme. A spokeswoman for Fox Sports told Reuters that the notion the company knew about or approved any bribes was ""emphatically false."" Globo said the company ""does not practice nor tolerate the payment of bribes."" Televisa also rejected the allegations. US prosecutors have not charged the three media companies. Burzaco's testimony comes just days after the start of the first US trial related to alleged corruption involving FIFA, the main international regulatory body for professional soccer. The far-reaching criminal probe was first revealed by US prosecutors in May 2015. A total of 42 individuals and entities have since been charged in the case. Twenty-four individuals have pleaded guilty. Defendants in the case include Manuel Burga, the former president of Peru's soccer federation; Jose Maria Marin, the former president of Brazil's soccer federation; and Juan Angel Napout, the former president of Paraguay's soccer federation who was also formerly the head of South America's main soccer governing body CONMEBOL. The first trial in the FIFA corruption scandal has only just begun, but the explosive testimony of witnesses thus far -- implicating two of the region's biggest media companies -- suggests that the case could have serious ramifications for other powerful individuals and entities throughout the region. A tragic sign of the potential impact of the trial came on November 13, when former Argentine official Jorge Alejandro Delhon committed suicide shortly after Burzaco testified that he paid $4 million in bribes to Delhon and his boss in exchange for help obtaining soccer broadcasting rights on Argentine state media. Soccer and organized crime have had a long history in Latin America, from match fixing to money laundering schemes and concealing criminal activities. But the revelations that the graft in the FIFA case involved huge media companies, in addition to officials from both government and the soccer world, may be a signal of the magnitude of the revelations yet to be made."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Drug Traffickers Used Venezuelas Isla Margarita as Backdoor to Europe. A Venezuelan island in the Caribbean that is a popular tourist destination was used by a Colombian trafficker to move drugs to the United States and Europe, in another example of Venezuela's coastal islands serving as transshipment points. Colombian trafficker Henry Carrillo-Ramirez, who pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges in a US federal court in early November, moved Colombian cocaine to the island of Margarita, about 25 miles northeast of mainland Venezuela. He then arranged to have small boats shuttle the drugs to offshore fishing vessels that ultimately smuggled them to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and even as far as Spain, according to the US Justice Department. The cocaine was produced in Colombia's Catatumbo region, along the northern Venezuela-Colombia border. Carrillo-Ramirez, alias ""Barriga,"" was a well-known businessman in the Colombian city of Cucuta when he was arrested in 2017. Colombian authorities have seized about five billion Colombian pesos (around $1.5 million) in assets belonging to him, according to La Opinion. During the four years that Carrillo-Ramirez's drug trafficking group was under investigation, law enforcement interdicted nearly two tons of cocaine belonging to it. Major busts included the seizure of 960 kilograms of cocaine on a boat headed to Europe; the interdiction of two boats carrying drugs to Puerto Rico; and Spanish authorities capturing a boat carrying 728 kilograms of cocaine in international waters. With drug trafficking through Venezuela skyrocketing amid the country's collapse, its Caribbean islands have increasingly served as both a waystation and a springboard for drug traffickers. Carrillo-Ramirez's trafficking group was able to produce cocaine on the Colombia-Venezuela border in the municipality of Tibu, in the department of Norte de Santander. There, the drugs were guarded by Victor Ramon Navarro Serrano, alias ""Megateo,"" the leader of a Popular Liberation Army (Ejercito Popular de Liberacion -- EPL) faction. Carrillo-Ramirez's alliance with Navarro Serrano, who was killed in 2015 , also facilitated the shipment of drugs across the border. Afterward, the drugs were moved across Venezuela to Margarita island. Given the long journey with numerous checkpoints and the difficulty of accessing the island -- which can only be reached by ferry, plane or motorboat -- it is likely that Carrillo-Ramirez's organization was paying off Venezuelan officials to allow for transport. The island of Margarita, known as the ""Pearl of the Caribbean,"" is a particularly attractive staging ground, providing access not only to other island nations, but also Europe. Carrillo-Ramirez's group was moving drugs directly to Spain. The island has served as a common drug stopover point for decades. It previously served as a safe haven for Colombia's Norte del Valle drug cartel kingpin Jaime Alberto Marin, alias ""Beto Marin,"" who was captured there in 2010. Amid the surge in cocaine trafficking out of Venezuela and to the Caribbean, other paradise islands off the country's coasts have become transshipment hotspots. Another chain of Venezuelan islands, known as the Los Roques Archipelago , has also been used to traffic gold and drugs, according to reports from a member of the National Assembly."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"FARC Earns $2.4 to $3.5 Billion From Drugs: Govt. The Colombian government's estimate that the FARC makes up to $3.5 billion annually in profts from the drug trade is staggering, but may not be entirely accurate. Speaking at a forum organized by the University of Miami on October 23, Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon provided the government's latest figures on the illicit activities of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). According to Pinzon, the FARC makes between $2.4 and $3.5 billion annually from the drug trade. He added that of the 350 tons of cocaine produced in Colombia annually, some 200 can be linked back to the guerrillas. Whereas the FARC were believed to have some 20,000 fighters at their peak in 2000, Pinzon said that they currently number 8,147, a drop of more than 50 percent in the past decade. Still, he noted that the rebels are ""a very different organization"" than before, having lost several top commanders in recent years. Estimating the size of the FARC's total budget is an inexact science. Pinzon's estimate of the rebels' profits from the drug trade differs widely from a recent calculation released by the Attorney General's Office, which put their total profits at around $1.1 billion. Both of these assessments are far higher than the United Nations Development program's calculation in 2003, which listed the FARC's annual income at no more than $342 million, with $204 million coming from the drug trade. Additionally, Pinzon's assertion that the FARC are ""linked"" to nearly two-thirds of cocaine produced in Colombia is a deceptively broad statement. These links can range from involvement in overseeing the early stages of coca cultivation and processing to directly exporting shipments of the drug into neighboring countries like Venezuela or Ecuador. While the guerrillas have been known to participate in the latter , the former arrangement is more common. Ultimately it may be best to take Pinzon's figures with a grain of salt. He is likely playing the hardline ""bad cop"" at the same time as the government enters into peace talks with the guerrillas to try to end the country's five-decade-old conflict. At the negotiating table the FARC are recognized as having political aspirations and their involvement in the drug trade is barely on the agenda for the talks. By focusing on the rebels' criminal activities in his public comments, Pinzon may be sending a signal to FARC leaders that a failure to follow through on the peace process could see them permanently labelled as nothing more than ""narco-terrorists."""	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexicos Missing 43: A One Year Retrospective. September 26 marked the one year anniversary of the abduction of 43 students near Iguala, Mexico. The event remains a defining moment of the Enrique Pena Nieto presidency, although the full truth of what happened to the students that night remains unknown. On the night of September 26, 2014, protesting students from a teachers college near Iguala, a town in the southwest state of Guerrero, were stopped by local police and handed over to criminal group the Guerreros Unidos, according to government investigators. The Guerreros Unidos allegedly proceeded to shoot and kill the students in a trash dump, then burned the remains and threw them in a river (See InSight Crime's timeline below for a full recap of the missing students case). The case of the missing 43 students quickly gained international attention. The Mexican government deployed over 4,000 federal police and soldiers to Guerrero to search for the students. Investigators believed they had achieved a breakthrough when an alleged leader of the Guerreros Unidos was captured in mid-October. The following month, police captured the fugitive mayor of Iguala and his wife, who was later identified by authorities as a leader of the Guerreros Unidos. In December, authorities said they had identified the remains of one of the missing students. However, when authorities presented the conclusions of their investigation in January, they were met with widespread skepticism. Numerous observers have since poked holes in the official version of events. Foreign forensic teams have cast doubt on the possibility that the students were burned at the trash dump (Mexican researchers had previously suggested the bodies were burned at an army crematorium ). Just this month, a report commissioned by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) offered several reasons why the government's version of what happened could not have taken place. One of the main impacts of the Iguala case was the shattering of President Enrique Pena Nieto's carefully-crafted image that Mexico had turned the corner in the fight against organized crime. The shocking details of the case were a reminder of how much corruption exists within Mexico's local government. At the same time, the case symbolized how the nature of Mexican organized crime has changed. The downfall of monolithic drug cartels has given rise to smaller criminal outfits dominating Mexico's underworld. In many ways, the Guerreros Unidos -- a splinter cell of the once-powerful Beltran Leyva Organization -- embodies how these smaller gangs remain the primary threat to Mexico's security, especially in rural areas where the gangs often work hand-in-hand with municipal authorities. The Iguala investigation also became a referendum of sorts on the credibility of the Mexican government , which drained away as more domestic and international observers became increasingly critical of the investigation. Despite several indications that security as a whole is improving in Mexico , the Iguala case remains a turning point for the Pena Nieto administration: afterwards, no one could deny how badly Mexico needs better police and more competent investigators. Meanwhile, the embarrassing escape of the world's most notorious drug lord, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman from a Mexican prison in July further eroded trust in the Mexican government. As for the victims, the government has only identified the remains of two students , with little indication that authorities are close to finding the others. The Pena Nieto government continues to insist that they are committing to finding ""truth and justice"" for the case, and has taken a series of notable actions since the release of the IACHR report in early September. These include the Attorney General's Office making the case open to the public for the first time; the arrest of another key criminal suspect involved in the event; and keeping other students in a witness protection program. However, one year on, the likelihood that the truth will ever emerge about what happened that night in Iguala appears to be slimmer than ever."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Paraguay-Argentina Crime Group Used Planes to Smuggle Marijuana. Authorities in Buenos Aires arrested 10 members of a binational criminal group that used planes to smuggle marijuana from Paraguay to Argentina, showing the enduring popularity of this method for moving large quantities of drugs. Buenos Aires police arrested five Paraguayans and five Argentines and seized 500 kilos of marijuana on March 27, reported La Nacion. The operation, dubbed ""The Lord of the Skies,"" also resulted in the confiscation of three planes that authorities say were used to smuggle marijuana from the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion to a hangar 100 kilometers southeast of Buenos Aires. The investigation, which lasted almost 18 months and included 6,000 hours of wiretapped surveillance, revealed that one of the group's planes made at least 30 cross-border trips last year. The modus operandi was to first send fumigation planes into the air to check whether it was safe for the drug planes to land, according to authorities. A judicial source close to the case told La Nacion there is no evidence that any of the arrested members of the group had political connections in Argentina. The drug flights didn't arouse suspicion because fumigation planes frequently circled the area where the planes landed, reported ABC Color. The operation's name harkens back to the powerful Mexican narco Amado Carrillo Fuentes, whose ""Lord of the Skies"" alias referred to his fleet of drug-laden aircraft. The former head of the Juarez Cartel died on the operating table while having plastic surgery in 1997, but his preferred method for trafficking cocaine remains popular across Latin America. Traffickers then and now prefer smuggling large amounts of drugs via plane because the shipments pass through fewer hands than if they were sent by land or sea. This not only cuts out the middleman, it makes the smuggling operation less risky, as it lowers the potential for betrayal. Efforts to contain drug flights do appear to be working in some countries. Authorities in Honduras and Colombia say they have almost totally eradicated the use of drug planes thanks to increased aerial surveillance. Not all countries have had this type of success, however. Argentina enacted a controversial policy in January 2016 that authorizes the military to shoot down suspected drug planes, but it doesn't seem to have had much impact. In addition to the recent marijuana smuggling operation, officials said last November that an average of 40 drug planes coming from Bolivia land in Argentina every month. The drug bust in Buenos Aires could also indicate that Paraguay's marijuana trade is becoming increasingly lucrative. An InSight Crime interview with the country's drug czar in 2014 revealed that the trafficking of Paraguayan marijuana could be a billion-dollar a year industry."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Powerful Rio Militia Targeted by Brazil Police. Authorities in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil have arrested 21 members of a militia that includes members of the security forces and is run by jailed leaders, another example of the strength of these paramilitary-style criminal groups. According to Estadao , a total of 27 arrest warrants and 90 search and seizure warrants were issued against the ""Justice League,"" reportedly one of the most violent criminal organizations operating in western Rio. Suspects detained included the alleged current leader, Marcos Jose de Lima Gomes, alias ""Gao,"" and 13 current and former members of the civil and military police, army, fire department and penitentiary administration. Police said the group charged fees for utilities and security services, targeting 5,000 residents in 1,600 apartments distributed across six low-income housing blocks in the Campo Grande neighborhood, reported Folha. The group also forced residents to buy gas and food from them at triple the regular price and took over apartments that they rented or sold, reported Estadao. The militia is believed to have made over $450,000 per month from these activities. Those who refused to make the required payments were tortured, killed or evicted, reported Veja. Investigators believe the militia receives orders from imprisoned former military police officers Ricardo Teixeira da Cruz, alias ""Batman,"" and Toni Angelo Souza Aguiar, alias ""the Erotic,"" who in turn operated on behalf of two jailed ex-politicians. The Justice League has been operating in Rio de Janeiro for years, under a similar modus operandi as that described in the recent operations. It is notable that this militia continues to operate -- and has even apparently increased profits -- despite the imprisonment of key leaders, which points to their power and official connections. The two politicians leading the operation -- Natalino Guimaraes and his brother Jerominho -- have both been incarcerated since 2008, and Teixeira da Cruz has reportedly continued directing operations from federal prison since 2009. The Rio militias were originally formed by police and civilians to combat the city's violent drug gangs -- the most prominent of which is the Red Command -- but later became involved in their own criminal operations. As in the case of the Justice League, their activities were facilitated by close ties to both law enforcement and the local government. Militias have also spread to other regions of the country , including Bahia state. This criminalization of militia groups has been seen in other countries in Latin America, most notably in the case of Colombia's paramilitaries , but also with certain vigilante groups in Mexico accused of cartel ties ."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
North Mexico Police Desert Training Course. Forty-three municipal police officers from the state of Tamaulipas, north Mexico, deserted a training course in the state of Chihuahua. The officers were part of a group of almost 350 police being vetted and trained in military tactics as part of Tamaulipas' strategy of police modernization and professionalization. They left after only 15 days of courses at the National Training Center, and their motivation is unknown. The Tamaulipas Public Security Secretary said that conditions have been difficult at the military training center and police have complained about the lack of food and grueling hours. The official did not say what the future holds for the deserters upon their expected return to Victoria, the capital of the Gulf coast state. He suggested they could be fired for refusing to complete required training, but those who were successfully vetted for corruption could be transferred to serve in other capacities. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Police Killings on the Rise in the Dominican Republic. At least 290 people were killed by police in the Dominican Republic in 2012, amidst a backdrop of declining public safey and increased drug trafficking in this Caribbean nation. Out of the more than 14,000 thefts and armed robberies reported last year, seven percent of the victims said that the police, or people dressed in police uniform, participated in the acts, according to Dominican Republic news source Hoy Digital. The data is taken from the annual report released by the country's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH). The commission president told Hoy that there are likely many other cases of police killings and violence not represented in the statistics. The CNDH receives at least one complaint per day about extrajudicial executions by police, or victims caught in the crossfire during shootouts. Over the past two decades, the homicide rate in the Dominican Republic has nearly doubled, from 13 homicides per 100,000 residents in 1991 to 25 homicides per 100,000 in 2011. According to Amnesty International , the police are responsible, on average, for around 15 percent of all homicides. Between January and July 2011, 154 people were killed by the police, up from 125 in 2010. While the majority of police killings are officially reported as resulting from ""exchanges of fire"" during shootouts, there are many reports of extrajudicial executions by police, including the murder of criminal associates by corrupt police officers. The National Police are widely mistrusted by the population due to the perception of endemic corruption and abuse. Over the past five years, over 500 police and soldiers have been fired due to ties with drug trafficking groups. Some of the increased violence and corruption may stem from the Dominican Republic's growing role in the international drug trade and the increased presence of transnational criminal organizations. As pressure has increased on drug traffickers in Mexico and Central America, smugglers have begun relying more on sea routes through the Caribbean. Dominican officials have repeatedly warned that the Sinaloa Cartel and other foreign criminal groups are expanding their presence, while a number of foreign traffickers have been arrested inside the country."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Venezuela Tries to Curb Increasingly Trigger-Happy Culture. Venezuela is altering its gun policy in an effort to stem the alarming level of street violence, but the entrenched nature of gun possession in the country will prove difficult to remedy in the short term. On June 6, Venezuelan Justice Minister Tareck El Aissami announced the establishment of a commission which is charged with tightening the regulation of arms in the country. Since its creation, the body has enacted a number of reforms, including banning the possession of firearms on public transport and leisure spaces such as bars and nightclubs. On September 22 Congressman Freddy Bernal, who heads the Domestic Policy Committee in the National Assembly, said that the commission would soon announce a 180-day freeze on the sale and import of guns, as well as the issuing of gun licenses. However, the fight against gun violence in Venezuela will be an uphill battle. As InSight Crime has documented, homicide rates in the country have skyrocketed in recent years. The independent Venezuelan Observatory of Violence (OVW) , basing its analysis on police files, has estimated that the murder rate in Venezuela has* more than quadrupled since 1999 , and claims that the 2010 per capita homicide rate in the country was 57 per 100,000. Government statistics put the figure significantly lower (48 per 100,000) but even this number still makes the country one of the most dangerous in South America. Much of the violence has been blamed on the easy availability of guns in the country. Although there are no firm statistics on civilian gun ownership (legal or illegal), a report for the Small Arms Survey estimates that there are between 1.6 and 4.1 million civilian firearms circulating in the country. This is slightly higher than the estimates of gun ownership in neighboring Colombia, which has more than one and a half times Venezuela's population. This year alone the Venezuelan government has seized and destroyed around 120,000 illegal firearms , which is equivalent to the total number of weapons seized in Mexico over the past five years. One potential factor in the availability of guns in Venezuela is the expansion of the military over the past several years. This has been accompanied by the creation and development of the ""Bolivarian Militia,"" an all-volunteer force that directly serves the president. The government says that there are more than 125,000 militia members, and the hope is that their ranks swell to reach two million. President Hugo Chavez made waves last October when he announced his wish to arm militia members. On top of this, the conventional security forces in the country have been shown to be particularly shaky when it comes to monitoring weapons stashes. Corruption in the military is rampant, and several army officers have been identified by U.S. authorities as having supplied arms to Colombian rebels, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ). With a Kalashnikov rifle factory set to start mass producing AK assault rifles in 2012, some analysts are afraid of the arms falling out of military hands and into the black market. Other officials can be equally unscrupulous. After the recent Venezuelan prison riot that resulted in 28 deaths, the prison's warden was arrested and charged with selling weapons to the inmates. As is the case in many other places where poverty is widespread, the problem is exacerbated by a gang culture that glorifies gun violence. The technical secretary of the new commission, Pablo Fernandez, told the BBC that this is one of the main challenges of his office. He claims that in many underprivileged areas of Venezuela, the possession of a firearm is ""an element of their identity, a perverse element of masculine assertion."" A recent report in the Guardian on ""malandros"" (street gangsters) in Caracas offers an alarming case study in this dynamic, detailing an ongoing conflict between rival gangs in El Consejo, a shantytown of 50,000 on the edge of Caracas. The battle, apparently sparked by a case of teenage bullying, has waged for eight months, resulting in the death of seven youths. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Millions Stolen by Hackers Shows Vulnerability of Mexicos Banks. Hackers infiltrated Mexico's banking system to transfer millions of dollars to bogus accounts and then made cash machines shell out the money, in a case that reveals the country's structural vulnerability to cyber crime. Authorities have arrested a group of hackers known as the ""Bandidos Revolutions Team,"" which infiltrated Mexico's domestic financial transfer system, Wired reported. The hackers were able to divert money to false accounts that they controlled. Their associates were then sent to the ATMs to withdraw the cash, netting the group between 100 million and 300 million pesos (between $5.2 million and $15.7 million) per month. In April of last year, the group carried out the largest cyber attack in Mexican history , siphoning off hundreds of millions of pesos from several banks. Following the attack, Bank of Mexico Governor Alejandro Diaz announced that a new cyber crime unit would be created and tasked with helping Mexico's banks better protect themselves from cyber attacks. The Bandidos Revolutions Team, which operated in several states in northern Mexico, was made up of a dozen young men in their twenties and thirties. On May 15, the leader of the group, Hector Ortiz Solares, also known as ""H-1,"" was arrested alongside eight other members in the city of Leon. During the arrests, police seized some two dozen luxury cars, as well as motorcycles, weapons, cash, drugs and computer equipment. A number of extravagant purchases made by Solares alerted police to the group's whereabouts. The group also drew police attention last April after transferring 500 million pesos (around $26 million) to 849 false accounts. In early March, authorities closed in on the group after ATMs in Leon and Tijuana suddenly began spitting out cash. Mexico has had some success in preventing cyber attacks, most notably in January of 2018, when authorities thwarted an attempt to steal $100 million by the Lazarus Group, a cyber crime syndicate with suspected links to North Korea. But major failures continue to occur. Ironically, the Bandidos Revolutions Team stole millions of dollars using the same tactics that the North Koreans had employed. Cyber crime has increased in Mexico, and only Brazil has faced more cyber crime attacks in Latin America. The banking system remains vulnerable, as shown by the enormous amount of cash the Bandidos Revolutions Team managed to steal. The group had been operating for at least five years, but police began tracking them just last year. Their capture ultimately was due to their inability to keep a low profile, and not the ability of Mexican security forces to thwart their attacks. Experts at the US-based cybersecurity company Symantec have pointed out that, despite such major attacks, little has been done to shore up Mexico's defense mechanisms against cyber crime. They also expressed little confidence that the administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is paying attention to the issue, and warned that cyber criminals will continue to target Mexican institutions in hopes of pulling off another multimillion-dollar heist."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Microsoft Opens Cyber Security Center in Mexico City. Microsoft is opening a cyber security center in Mexico City in order to better combat an estimated $4 billion industry, a decision that points to growing concern about this type of crime in the country. Microsoft issued a press release on February 24 announcing the opening of the new center and outlining its projected role in advancing cyber security in the region. ""By opening this center, we are bringing Microsoft's offer of security increasingly closer to customers in order to be a strategic part of their transformation, and together we will create a country and a region that are more prosperous and productive, and above all, that are safer,"" said Jorge Silva, general manager of Microsoft Mexico. According to Microsoft's estimates , Mexico loses up to $4 billion dollars annually to cyber criminal activity. Mexico's Technical Secretary on the National Security Council, Tomas Zeron de Lucio, recently said that Mexico is the second-hardest hit country in Latin America by cyber crime, after Brazil, and ranks in the top 10 worldwide. While the Microsoft facility is designed to serve the region in general, a special deal was signed between the Mexican Federal Police and Microsoft's team designed to both boost IT security and assist in investigations regarding internet crimes. After opening a cyber crime center in Colombia in 2013 (Silva was the head of Microsoft Colombia at the time), it appears that Microsoft is shifting its attention to Mexico. This provides a larger market for the company's security products while also presenting it with a greater range of threats to address. Latin America's largest and most complex criminal groups are based in Mexico, and as these groups adapt and cyber crime becomes a more important weapon, Mexico and Microsoft may increasingly find themselves on the front lines of cyber crime prevention in the region. Indeed, organized crime is already making inroads into this burgeoning criminal industry. A cyber security specialist told local media in December that cyber theft is carried out by ""very well structured groups, with experts for every stage of the process: infiltration, capture, commercialization."" Meanwhile, Mexican officials have struggled to make the necessary changes to confront and counteract cyber crime. Mexico has gained a reputation as a relatively safe operating zone for cyber criminals engaging in personal information theft. Critics say that criminals operate with impunity and that the authorities lack the tools and legislation to prosecute cases of cyber crime."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
3 Recommendations for Colombias Fight Against Cyber Crime. A report by Colombia's Chamber of Communications lays out several ways the Andean nation -- among the top five Latin American countries in terms of Internet users -- can better combat cyber crime. Colombia has seen some prominent cyber security breaches in the past few years, incuding attacks by hacker group Anonymous against official government web sites and social media pages, and the interception of e-mails related to the government's current peace talks with rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). A new report released by Colombia's Chamber of Communications and non-profit policy research center Fedesarrollo offers several recommendations for how the country's cyber security policy can move forward: 1) Create a national center responsible for training government bodies in charge of cyber security. Colombia relies on a special command within the police, a joint unit within the military, and an agency run by the ministries of Defense, Justice, and Information Technologies to deal with cyber security issues. The report argues that Colombia needs a centralized agency that not would not only help these various bodies coordinate better, but would also provide a space for the private sector, academia and think-tanks to share training and knowledge on cyber crime. 2) Establish prosecution teams that specialize in investigating cyber crime. This is based on a recommendation offered by the Organization of American States (OAS) to several Latin American countries. 3) Increase international cooperation to fight cyber crime. This includes joining international cyber security treaties like the Budapest Convention , and becoming more involved with the global network of expert computer emergency response teams. Probably one of the biggest cyber security problems Colombia will face in the coming years is bulking up security around its online banking sector -- according to the Chamber of Communications report, 35 percent of all banking operations are now performed via the Internet in Colombia. Earlier this year, Colombian authorities arrested a group of hackers accused of stealing the financial information of some 15,000 people, along with $5.2 million from various bank accounts. As recommended by the report, establishing special prosecution teams could go a long way in addressing this particular threat. According to police statistics cited in the report, Colombian police made 422 arrests related to cyber crime in 2013, a 67 percent increase from arrests made in 2011.	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Argentina Police Extorted Black Market Buenos Aires Shopkeepers: Officials. Authorities in Argentina successfully interrupted a major extortion ring in the capital Buenos Aires, in an operation that reveals how longstanding police corruption has contributed to illegal activities in the city. On June 21, Buenos Aires police arrested Jorge Castillo, the so-called ""king"" of an infamous black market known as La Salada, on charges of ""illegal exploitation of public space"" and theft, according to a press release from the Buenos Aires Security Ministry. Police detained 21 individuals, notably including one federal and two provincial police officers, and three of Castillo's family members, La Nacion reported. Together the group allegedly controlled three criminal bands within the market: the ""Cucos,"" the ""Chaquenos"" and the ""River."" The groups reportedly charged over 8,000 shopkeepers 500 pesos (about $31) a day to rent a space the equivalent of one square meter. National Security Minister Patricia Bullrich referred to Castillo's criminal network in a tweet as a ""parallel state,"" in which he and an ""army"" of criminals were able to extort small shopkeepers for exorbitant sums in collusion with local police. The US Department of Commerce has labeled La Salada one of the ""largest black markets in South America,"" adding that work conditions there can be ""slave-like"". Originally opened in 1991, the black market is known for the sale of contraband and counterfeit goods at prices up to ten times cheaper than in legal stores. The Salada enterprise has since escalated into a national phenomenon. Thousands of ""saladitas"" throughout the country move about $56 billion pesos a year and account for a remarkable 45 percent of domestic trade, according to the Argentine Confederation of Small Businesses (Confederacion Argentina de la Mediana Empresa - CAME). InSight Crime Analysis: The fact that Castillo and the criminal networks he headed allegedly worked with police to carry out their extensive extortion operations serves as a reminder of how longstanding corruption in Buenos Aires' law enforcement institutions has facilitated criminal activities in the city. ""There are no mafias that operate in Argentina without police, judicial and political complicity,"" stated Buenos Aires Security Minister Cristian Ritondo. Somewhat ironically, Castillo's networks were extorting businesses that were themselves likely operating on the margins of the law, which could have contributed to the ease with which the extortionists were able to continue bilking shopowners. Rather than shutting down these black market businesses, it appears that police were working hand in hand with criminals to take advantage of them. The episode is yet another example of the extent of police corruption in Buenos Aires, where the new provincial police chief recently estimated that some 10 percent of the force's roughly 90,000 officers could be corrupt."	0	1	0	0	1	0	0
"Timber Laundering in Peru: The Mafia in the Middle. Illegal timber in Peru is sourced and sold across the country. But most of the money laundering happens in between these destinations. Our team traveled to Pucallpa, the hub of this illicit activity. Lashed together in great long rafts or piled high on river barges, logs float in from the wildest reaches of the Amazon to converge on one part of eastern Peru: Pucallpa, the city where the destruction of the rainforest becomes legal. Hacked out of the jungle on the banks of the Ucayali river and linked to Lima by highway, Pucallpa connects the wilderness of central and northern Peru to its biggest domestic timber market and its principal international port. This makes it a key transit hub for an industry that moves around 2.6 million cubic meters of wood every year. Anywhere between 40 to 80 percent of this wood is illegal, according to estimates by government bodies and independent experts. The center of activity is Pucallpa's port district of Manantay, where winches await to pluck the logs out of the river and pile them high on the muddy banks. The air is permeated by the smell of sawdust and the whine of timber saws from illegal mills where loggers or buyers take their black market wood and receive their first cut. On the outskirts, informal loggers from jungle communities unload timber cut in forest camps directly onto the river banks, where waiting stevedores load it onto rickety trucks. *This article is the result of research on eco-trafficking in the region done in conjunction with American University's Center for Latin American and Latino Studies ( CLALS ). Once the loads reach Manatay, the timber traffickers step in. Their role is to launder the dirty wood with fraudulent paperwork then dispatch it to clients who demand cheap wood and plausible deniability. Their work contaminates almost the entire timber supply chain coming from Pucallpa. ""In Pucallpa, everyone handles illegal wood, absolutely everyone,"" Julio Reategui, a prosecutor from the Pucallpa organized crime unit, told InSight Crime on a recent visit. ""And the bigger they are, the more they are protected, this is the reality."" Black Market Loggers The lower rungs of the timber trafficking trade are populated by dispatchers, who oversee the comings and goings at the port. They use their position to match local sellers with buyers, working their deals from little wooden shacks dotting the riverbanks. A notch above are individual timber traders known as ""comisionistas,"" who act as agents for clients in Lima. The comisionistas take orders and cash advances, then find, buy and dispatch timber shipments in return for a percentage cut of every deal. However, timber traffickers move the real volume and make the real money in Pucallpa, hiding behind the facades of legal companies. Many of these are ghost companies. Their legal representatives are the poor and unemployed, while their registered addresses are rundown houses or neighborhood shops. They flicker into existence, move large quantities of wood, then disappear within one or two years. ""Most businesses in Pucallpa are front companies for criminals. On paper, they are legal, but it's a facade,"" said Reategui. However, some of the biggest traffickers operate differently, blending the legal and the illegal. Among the most significant of these operations are the sawmills. There are 25 major sawmills located around the Manantay port district. In an anti-logging operation in 2015, authorities identified 12 of these as highly likely to be involved in criminal activity. ""They launder a lot in the sawmills,"" said Albino Aliaga Campos from the Pucallpa office of the Agency for the Supervision of Forest Resources (Organismo de Supervision de los Recursos Forestales - OSINFOR), the state body charged with inspecting the logging sector. ""They come by river, arriving with the illegal wood, unload, and then from that point on it just needs a transport permit."" While the primary role of timber traffickers is as intermediaries between illegal loggers and buyers, many also take on a more direct role in extraction by financing logging operations. In this system, known in the Peruvian Amazon as ""habilitacion,"" the traffickers recruit loggers, then hand them cash advances, equipment and orders to cut down certain species. According to Rolando Navarro, the former president of OSINFOR, traffickers such as those running the sawmills may do this independently or as agents for the biggest players in the Peruvian timber trade -- export companies that sell laundered Peruvian wood abroad. ""The exporter tells these guys, I need so many cubic meters of wood, can you deliver? Take your money. And [the traffickers] go around distributing this money to everyone, they are financers."" he said. ""Their guys cut down the wood wherever they find it. They come to Pucallpa, they process it and then the sawmills hand over the processed timber to the exporter."" Laundering Illegal Wood The middlemen of Peru's timber trafficking trade are not the only actors laundering illegal wood. However, the role they play has grown in importance as regulation of the timber trade has evolved. ""The law changed and the rules of the game changed for the mafias,"" said one forestry agent, who did not want to be identified for fear of repercussions. Many of the biggest players in the illegal wood trade are logging companies and timber conglomerates that launder illegal wood through their own legal forest concessions. These companies once operated with virtual impunity. But life has become more complicated thanks to a new forestry law that came into force in 2015, increased international pressure, and the efforts of OSINFOR. But OSINFOR's jurisdiction only covers inspections carried out in sections of forest legally allocated for logging, so their agents can only walk past illegal operations on their way to inspect legal companies. ""Many times, a businessman is working and he sees illegal [loggers] working at his side. But illegal workers don't worry about anything while the businessman has all the institutions coming to supervise him,"" said forestry consultant Guiomar Seijas. If illegal loggers can get their shipments through the ill-equipped, undermanned and rampantly corrupt riverside checkpoints to arrive in Pucallpa, then the traffickers and their document dealers can handle the rest. ""There is this big vacuum here,"" said Seijas. This lopsided law enforcement is a source of frustration for both the logging companies, who feel victimized and for OSINFOR, who feel their hands are tied. However, for the mafia in the middle of the illegal timber trade, this vacuum is leaving an ever-bigger and more lucrative space to operate. *This article is the result of research on eco-trafficking in the region done in conjunction with American University's Center for Latin American and Latino Studies ( CLALS ).

The Increasing Dangers Facing Latin Americas Park Rangers. A park ranger's shooting in Costa Rica and the slaying of another in a Colombian reserve show the dangers rangers face in protected areas, which are as diverse in flora and fauna as they are in criminal economies. The ranger in Costa Rica was shot in the stomach by three armed drug traffickers who opened fire on authorities after being spotted on the beaches of Corcovado National Park, EFE reported. On May 11, the trio had ditched a drug submarine and fled to the park's shores along the Pacific coast. Dangerous weather kept rescuers from reaching the injured ranger that night. But he was taken to a hospital the next day where he was reported in stable condition. in a settlement inside the massive park, located along the Sierra Nevada mountain range in northern Colombia. Authorities have not determined why Leon was targeted. But Colombia's director of national parks, Julia Miranda, said after the shooting that her department had tallied some 17 threats against rangers and directors at 11 different parks in 2018. The pair of shootings highlight the dangers rangers face when patrolling remote reserves where armed groups also roam. Though criminal dynamics across the region vary, many of the illicit economies that draw these groups to remote parks are the same: coca cultivation, drug trafficking, illegal gold mining, and animal and timber poaching. Such economies have attracted at least 17 armed groups to set up within Colombia's some 60 national parks, which are historically no strangers to warfare. One legacy of Colombia's long-running conflict is that several parks have been no-go zones for years, in some cases due to the presence of land mines. The demobilization of Colombia's largest guerrilla force, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), was meant to help open up these spaces. But many of these formerly FARC controlled zones have since been exposed to a range of criminal actors, including FARC dissidents, other guerrilla forces like National Liberation Army's (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN), and smaller armed trafficking groups. For example, Santa Marta's top security official said that a group known as Los Pachencas had made incursions into areas near the settlement where the park ranger was killed to secure drug trafficking routes. In addition to providing cover for the production and movement of cocaine, park land is also used to sow coca. In 2017, some 8,300 hectares of coca were cultivated in 16 Colombian national parks, a jump from about 8,000 acres the previous year, according to the latest report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's (UNODC) crop monitoring system in Colombia. In 2011, parkland only accounted for 3,200 acres of coca. Illegal gold mining has made it so dangerous for rangers in the Farallones de Cali National Park that they can only go on patrols with the army. Just last year, some 30 active mining excavations were discovered within the park, located in the Valle de Cauca department in western Colombia. Costa Rica's park rangers are also under threat because of drug trafficking along the country's coasts, which are favored maritime smuggling routes. After the shooting of the ranger, the trade union that represents workers in Costa Rica's Environmental Ministry questioned the limited resources and training given to park authorities. What's more, a survey of some 300 Central American park rangers found that 70 percent felt they did not have proper equipment to ensure their safety. Elsewhere, two rangers in Paraguay's Tapyta national reserve were shot dead last year. Authorities said the pair had crossed paths with illegal hunters. After the shooting, families and friends of the rangers protested, demanding their killers be brought to justice. An informal study of websites and other online groups found that 79 park rangers in Latin America were killed between 1995 and 2015. As armed groups continue to make incursions into protected areas, the job of being a park ranger will only become more dangerous.	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Report Reveals Intersection of Development Projects, Organized Crime in Honduras. A new report by the watchdog group Global Witness suggests that state institutions co-opted by business and political elites helped transform Honduras into the world's most dangerous place for environmental activists, highlighting how criminal networks can turn development projects into deadly illicit enterprises. The report by Global Witness -- an organization that investigates how corruption and the exploitation of natural resources drive environmental and human rights abuses -- says that 123 environmental activists have been killed in Honduras since 2009, when a coup ousted then-President Manuel Zelaya. According to the report, ""Nowhere on earth are you more likely to be killed for protesting the theft of land and destruction of the natural world than in Honduras."" Over the course of two years, Global Witness interviewed dozens of witnesses and conducted extensive research to better understand the ""economic and political forces"" behind the murders. These investigations helped produce five specific case studies -- three of which involved the murder of an environmental activist -- that highlight how corrupt and criminal acts allowed ""well-connected Hondurans to push through their business deals at a huge cost to whole communities and the environment."" While each study details a specific case, the sheer influence and power of Honduran business and political elites is a constant theme. In one study, Global Witness alleges a ""clear conflict of interest"" for Honduran National Party President and Vice President of Congress, Gladis Aurora Lopez, in two hydroelectric dam projects that violently repressed the community members who opposed them. According to documents leaked to Global Witness, Lopez's husband, Arnold Gustavo Castro, is the sole director of Inversiones Encinos S.A. and Inversiones Aurora S.A., the two companies that own the Los Encinos and La Aurora hydroelectric dam projects. Global Witness alleges Lopez's political influence helped the companies illegally obtain contracts for the projects while she was in Congress. Under a Honduran law cited by the report, the government is not authorized to grant members of Congress or their spouses contracts or concessions granted by the state. Instead of bringing economic development to the area, the allegedly illegal dam projects appear to have brought a wave of deceit and violent repression. After heavy machinery arrived for construction of the Los Encinos dam, residents of Santa Elena ""organized a series of peaceful protests"" demanding that the company formally consult with those who would be affected. In response, community members allege that Lopez backed an attempted violent eviction of Santa Elena's residents where they were ""shot at, had their crops destroyed and belongings set on fire."" This came after three indigenous activists who opposed the dam in Santa Elena were murdered. One was found dismembered, while reports described another who was found with burns across his body and his hands bound with military boot laces. To quell the opposition, eyewitnesses told Global Witness that Lopez allegedly arranged for ""almost 600 Salvadoran nationals"" who were promised work on the Los Encinos dam to sign agreements to the concession of the dam as if they were part of the communities to be affected. When Global Witness reviewed the document outlining the consultation, however, the signatures were missing. For three years, the Lenca Indigenous Movement of La Paz (Movimiento Indigena Lenca de La Paz Honduras - MILPAH) filed requests to the Sant Elena Mayor's office for the signatures. It also filed a complaint with the anti-corruption prosecutor. But the mayor's office never disclosed the list and eventually said it had lost it, suggesting what Global Witness described as a ""deliberate effort by authorities to cover up the fake consultation on the dam."" When Lo?pez was asked to comment on these allegatons, Global Witness reported that she ""denied any involvement in the consultation meeting for the Los Encinos project or in the violent police incursion of September 2014."" Regarding the contracts that Congress approved for the projects, Lo?pez and her husband both denied any conflict of interest or illegality. Economic development can be a messy business, especially in places like Honduras where endemic corruption and impunity expose vulnerable communities to the possibility of exploitation. Through forming criminal structures that use violence and corruption, some business and political elites appear to have taken advantage of these development projects for their own enrichment. The situation became particularly acute, according to Global Witness, following a 2009 coup in which then-President Manuel Zelaya was deposed. In the aftermath, business and political elites solidified control over certain industries and development projects, exploiting the country's resources and violently repressing communities occupying the land. While corruption and impunity are a given in Honduras, it seems that economic development projects are increasingly being used, at times illegally, to enrich political elites. And Honduran accountability systems have shown difficulties in holding allegedly corrupt officials accountable. As Global Witness outlines, accountability systems that have been put in place, such as the law preventing concessions to members of Congress and their spouses, have been ineffective. Elites have either ignored these laws all together or found ways around them through corruption. Finding ways to battle corruption and impunity is no new challenge in Honduras. And while efforts are already underway to reform state institutions , their long-term effectiveness in combatting corruption and violence surrounding economic development projects remains to be seen."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Brazil Creates New Specialist Unit to Combat Illegal Logging. The Brazilian government has launched a new anti-logging security force unit in an attempt to tackle a lucrative criminal trade that has turned Brazil into one of the most dangerous countries in the world for environmental activists. The Brazilian Ministry of Justice, working with the Ministry of the Environment and the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES), has announced the creation of a new Environmental Operations Unit of the National Public Security Force, which is made up mainly of Military Police. The new 200-strong unit will be posted at key strategic points along the smuggling trail for illegal timber in the Amazon rainforest to carry out surveillance and control of illegal logging activities. It will supplement the National Force's current efforts to combat the trade, which since 2008 have seen them seize more than 1 million cubic meters of wood, 300 chainsaws and 200 tractors, according to the Ministry of Justice. The new force will be backed by a $10 million investment from Brazil's Amazon Fund -- set up to tackle rainforest deforestation -- which will be used to purchase equipment needed to operate in isolated jungle territories and to fund operations targeting illegal loggers. Illegal logging accounts for up to 80 percent of all logging activity in Brazil, according to the government's own estimates , and it is the primary driver of the country's sky high deforestation levels. The profits on offer have created a powerful criminal class operating in isolated corners of the Amazon, whose easy use of violence to silence informants and activists has made Brazil the most dangerous country in the world for environmentalists. According to a report by Global Witness , a UK-based human rights and environmental NGO, between 2002 and 2013, at least 448 environmentalists and land rights activists were murdered in Brazil, the majority related to logging. Just one percent of cases resulted in a conviction. In recent years, the Brazilian authorities have begun to act against these networks, and the creation of a specialist anti-logging unit follows on from other actions such as the deployment of troops to logging hotspots, the use of drones to monitor deforestation and the drafting of regulations to try and prevent the export of illegal timber ( pdf ). Together, these actions place Brazil at the fore when it comes to tackling eco-trafficking in the region, an issue which is rarely prioritized by governments. However, the scale of the task the Brazilians face is huge, the size of the rainforest and the jungle terrain make for a logistical nightmare, while the networks behind the trade are firmly entrenched and are often protected by corrupt contacts as well armed thugs.	0	0	1	0	0	1	0
Peru Seizes 16,000 Dried Seahorses. Authorities in Peru seized thousands of dried seahorses destined for sale in Asia, illustrating the South American country's status as a wildlife trafficking hub and Asia's insatiable appetite for exotic remedies and aphrodisiacs. On August 23, Peruvian authorities seized the over 16,000 dried seahorses from wildlife traffickers in Lima, BBC reported. Police confiscated the three cases carrying the seahorses after the traffickers dropped them in the street and fled the scene. According to Police chief Victor Fernandez, the seahorses would have earned the traffickers up to $250,000 abroad. The seahorses, which breed along Peru's north Pacific coast, are protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Seahorse fishing has been banned in Peru since 2004 and is punishable by two to five years in prison. Dried seahorses are popular in Asian countries where they are used in traditional medicines and as a supposed aphrodisiac. High demand for seahorse powder makes the trade profitable for traffickers, despite bans. In 2011 alone, Peruvian authorities seized two tons of seahorses destined for export, according to the AFP. In addition to being a popular source of black market seahorses, Peru is also the source of other exotic animals. In 2009, Chilean authorities captured a boat carrying hundreds of live animals , including toucans and crocodiles, from Peru that were destined for illegal sale. According to Global Financial Integrity , a branch of the Center for International Policy, the illegal wildlife trade earns traffickers an estimated $7.8 to $10 billion annually. However, many countries do not have sufficient resources to crack down on the trade, which is especially difficult to monitor in largely remote areas where many of the exotic species are found.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Why Environmental Security is Paramount to Venezuelas Future. Venezuela's historic meltdown is often explained as a consequence of bad governance, corruption and the collapse of the oil sector or of international sanctions. Solutions are sought in the political sphere -- dialogue, free elections, regime change -- but there is little room to maneuver on either end of the political spectrum. The Maduro government has few political allies left, and as it digs in its heels in a bid to hold onto power it seems to have few resources and little time to undertake serious efforts to mitigate the impact of the deep economic crisis. The opposition, meanwhile, conducts a campaign focused on emphasizing what is wrong, but lacks an integral vision for a future Venezuela. The environment is usually left out of the debate, but issues including conservation, natural resource management and access to ecosystems are vital to the stability of the country. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (or UN Environment), achieving peace by taking natural resources and the environment into consideration ""is no longer an option -- it is a security imperative."" In recently suspended talks between the government and opposition -- brokered by the Norwegian government -- the environment was not even on the agenda. However, resource conflicts and the management and protection of Venezuela's natural heritage are not only important from a conservation angle -- they are the key to achieving a sustainable political solution and unlocking Venezuela's future. *This article was edited for greater clarity and published with the approval of The Washington Office on Latin America ( WOLA ). It does not necessarily represent Insight Crime's opinions. Read the original article here. A Political, and Environmental, Crisis The Maduro government claims Venezuela has the second-largest gold reserves in the world and decreed a massive mining development area baptized the ""Orinoco Mining Arc"" in 2016. So far, this piece of legislation seems nothing more than a legal jacket around an uncontrolled sector. Foreign investors stayed away while illegal mining became rampant. The environmental degradation caused by unregulated mineral extraction and conflicts over access to these valuable lands has already forcibly displaced populations, while the nationwide economic collapse and the consequent decline in employment and income has driven others to venture into the lawless mining region south of the Orinoco river. Many of the lands that are being aggressively exploited are home to indigenous groups, who are often deprived of their livelihoods and means of survival. Alternative survival strategies often mean participating in illegal mining economies as the national currency rendered nearly worthless by hyperinflation has led to an acceptance of gold as an alternative to cash, or joining the non-state armed groups that run the regions rich in minerals. The presence of foreign and Venezuelan armed groups has been tolerated by the government, resulting in a loss of sovereignty over vast swaths of territory, while resource revenues grow the influence of violent actors. These latter include local crime syndicates, called ""sindicatos,"" as well as corrupt elements of the state. While these parallel economies based on gold were created, it enabled criminal elements in control over resources to turn these informal economies into social and political capital. Even though Venezuela is not formally at war, warlordism and frequent violent clashes are now a feature of the south. Heavily armed state security forces with their faces covered drive around in armored vehicles with mounted guns, controlling jungle airports and access to illegal mines the states of Amazonas and Bolivar. Colombian guerrilla groups that sometimes operate side by side with the army clash with mining sindicatos, and massacres, torture and slave labor are commonplace in the mining zones. For this reason, one can plainly refer to extracted minerals from these areas as ""conflict resources,"" and their commercialization should be treated as the facilitation of serious human rights violations. Revenues from mining currently provide political elites with a financial lifeline and are of paramount importance to maintaining power. If countries can rely on revenues from resource extraction, taxpayers' contributions become less important, generating a disconnect between the government and its citizens. This has been the case ever since the development of the oil industry in Venezuela. Lack of transparency in government accounts, including the issue of extra-legal revenues derived from resource extraction, disenfranchises the population, and facilitates authoritarianism. Call them guerrillas, ""sindicatos,"" ""pranes,"" or corrupted factions of the army -- they are there to stay. In that regard, Venezuela is beginning to resemble neighboring Colombia, where land-grabbing, rural warfare and predatory and illicit natural resource exploitation (whether of coca, illegal gold mining, agroindustries) have been a major feature for over half a century. The 2016 peace deal between Colombia's government and the FARC is considered the ""greenest"" peace deal ever made , featuring green growth and sustainable development plans, but its faltering implementation, specifically with regard to rural economic development, access to lands and illegal crops, has exposed its fragility. These gaps are also a major explanation for the huge increase in deforestation in former guerrilla-controlled areas and resuming regional tensions. In Venezuela, ""peace"" and the environment should be on the agenda, and armed groups operating without restriction must be dismantled by the competent authorities and law enforcement. Nevertheless, this scenario is difficult to envision with the current rates of impunity, corruption within the ranks of the armed forces, and state violence in Venezuela. International stakeholders must recognize that Venezuela is not just a political battleground for ""Chavistas"" and the opposition, but a country in which resource conflicts and armed groups are the norm over large swaths of the national territory. It is essential that post-transition Venezuela not be marked by the mistake to not include environmental security. In a report , UN Environment analyzed intra-state conflicts over the last sixty years, and one of its preliminary conclusions is that if there is a link between conflict and natural resources, the likelihood of a relapse into conflict within the first five years after a peace deal is twice as high. There is a risk of serious conflict in southern Venezuela. A change of government or a shift in power at the executive level might throw current alliances into turmoil, causing further tensions. Mineral reserves and armed groups know no international boundaries, and mining violence and conflicts over access to mines have already caused frictions on the borders with Colombia, Guyana and Brazil. Not to address the problem of the environment and armed groups in Venezuela's south is to guarantee major headaches for the whole region in the future. Involving Natural Resources in Any Future Negotiations In most peace agreements the role of natural resources and the environment is overlooked or underestimated. Possible future initiatives to negotiate a transition in Venezuela should not make the mistake of ignoring these vital issues. The country could quickly relapse into conflict over resources that not only contribute to the financial empowerment of a number of non-state groups but also generate and sustain corruption in the armed forces. The economic incentive can hinder de-escalation efforts and initiatives to negotiate in good faith with both non-state armed actors and the government elites sustained by their illegal activities, as a transition might hinder access to the revenue gained either directly from resource exploitation or from taxing these activities. Properly handled, the management of natural resources and the environment could provide tools to help achieve an agreement. Instead of a race to the bottom, patience, expertise and transparency should be applied in debates about how to manage natural resources, both now and in a future Venezuela. Countries more than often use resource extraction as a tool to quickly gain revenues after a situation of conflict or crisis, but there are many factors to be taken into account if new conflicts are to be prevented from arising. At present the scale of Venezuela's mineral reserves remains unclear; serious socio-environmental impact studies have not been undertaken and indigenous populations have not been appropriately consulted. This can only contribute to protracted conflicts over land use and access to resources and thereby increase instability and proneness to strife. Examining options for resource sharing to maximize mutual benefits for stakeholders could be a confidence-building exercise not only for opposing parties but for other stakeholders who have hitherto been ignored, in particular local populations. Exploring these scenarios together, and assessing socio-environmental impacts, best future practices, and environmental protection and restoration; would provide an opportunity to bring different actors closer together. To begin with, a thorough assessment should be carried out by involved diplomats and relevant UN agencies, specifically UN Environment, to identify the best mediation strategies and which stakeholders should have a voice in this process. UN crisis prevention policy and methodologies for environmental peacebuilding have been developed but have not yet been applied to Venezuela. Transparency is paramount, and resource ownership should be ""de-linked"" from management and distribution of revenues. It is important to seek mutual benefits -- for example, with regard to employment, infrastructure development and sustainable and diversified economies -and thereby increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. Scenario-building can help participants to visualize ideas and thus foster interest. Take the oil sector, for example: Venezuela has been plagued by the resource curse -- low indices of democracy, development and economic growth despite an abundance of resources -- but the promotion of sustainable and green economies deserves serious consideration. Doing so would take into account future sustainability, both economically and environmentally, and prevent ""conflict resources"" from financing violence and generating massive environmental impacts and hence forced displacement and loss of livelihood. To ignore these issues until years into a post-dialogue scenario would be to undermine the sustainability of any transition. Negotiators should not assume they are too sensitive or complicated and must be addressed at a later stage: capitalizing on them could generate a platform for dialogue on environmental protection, biodiversity and land use, and could function as a confidence-building exercise in talks. The humanitarian situation in the country is very much related to current and future developments south of the Orinoco and donors should be open to needs there which go beyond the purely humanitarian and developmental aspects of the crisis. There is a role here not only for UN Environment but for other UN bodies. The Sustainable Development Goals and Sustaining Peace (one of the UN's main objectives) mutually reinforce one another. ""Peace and Security"" is one of the three central UN pillars, and violence, forced labor, prostitution and human trafficking in Venezuela's south are directly linked to the crisis and the mining bonanza which has empowered violent actors. The malaria epidemic in Venezuela is also directly related to the rapid expansion of mining and associated deforestation. These issues should be addressed now and even as the UN focuses on more traditional humanitarian needs, a wider involvement of agencies such as UNEP, UNHCR and the WHO with regard to environmental security will be required, either in-country or via remote means. Addressing these issues in ways that facilitate a peaceful democratic transition and ensure truly sustainable development is essential. But if no alternatives are found, the push factors to dig further into the Orinoco Mining Arc abound. In January 2016, the year in which Nicolas Maduro decreed the creation of the Orinoco Mining Arc, a gram of gold was worth just over 35 USD on international markets, but by September 2019 it had risen above 48 USD a gram and has become ever more attractive to warlords hungry for more, and desperate Venezuelans looking to make ends meet. The gold rush in Venezuela seems far from over and will cause severe problems of instability for the region as a whole if international agendas continue to ignore the dynamics in Venezuela's south. *This article was edited for greater clarity and published with the approval of The Washington Office on Latin America ( WOLA ).

"GameChangers 2018: 5 Reasons LatAm Organized Crime Will Strengthen in 2019. It is hard to be optimistic for 2019. The current trends all point to a strengthening of organized crime throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, as the criminals adapt far more quickly than authorities to changing conditions and take advantage of new opportunities. Here are the five reasons why we fear that organized crime will grow in strength and sophistication during 2019 in Latin America: 1. No Integrated or Transnational Response to Organized Crime Transnational organized crime can only be successfully tackled transnationally. Yet in Latin America, there is less and less bilateral, regional or international cooperation against fast-evolving criminal dynamics. This year offers even fewer prospects of a unified response. The United States, for good or ill, has historically been the regional leader against organized crime, using its power and influence to devise and promote regional responses. In the past, Washington had tried to corral governments into tackling the criminal dynamics that impact the United States directly: drug trafficking and illegal migration. However, US President Donald Trump has upended the notion of ""soft power,"" gentle persuasion, and the democratic and human rights compass that shaped recent US foreign policy. Trump has also managed to offend the two traditional regional allies in the fight against organized crime: Mexico (the infamous ""rapists"" comment is just one example) and Colombia (which he threatened to decertify in the war on drugs). US President Donald Trump Credit: AP Photos While Trump has banged the immigration drum very hard, amid mutterings of walls and zero tolerance, he has not instituted any new strategies to address the issue at source in Latin America, although a newly announced aid package for Central America is seeking to address this. Indeed, his policies may well be feeding more migration to the United States. Indeed, his isolationist policies may well send more migrants to the United States, especially because the region is so low on his list of priorities. When he engaged, Trump has divided Latin governments rather than nudge them towards common policies and unity in the face of growing criminal threats. Central America, for example, has seen mixed messages from Washington. The region has been told to tackle migration northwards ; yet the US is abandoning the fight against organized crime, which through intimidation, corruption, and extortion forces people to seek a better life elsewhere. A prime example of this is the lack of a clear US commitment to the United Nations-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG). This reversal of US policy came in part because of lobbying by the besieged Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales, himself a target of a CICIG-led investigation. Morales' strategy was simple: please Trump. He did this by supporting Trump's decision to move the US Embassy in Israel and by ingratiating himself with Trump's inner circle. This has sent a clear message to Latin American leaders: Keep on President Donald Trump's good side and you may well be able to get away with murder, or at least illegal campaign financing, which are the charges that Morales is facing. Regional bodies are not faring any better. The Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) seems to be moribund. And the Organization of American States and the Lima Group, which represents 17 countries in the region, have been distracted by Venezuela, which is declining into dictatorship and whose refugees are entering almost every nation in the region. There are limited examples, however, of bilateral cooperation among nations. Peru and Bolivia have been working together tackle the cocaine air bridge between the two countries, while Colombia has regular exchanges of intelligence with both Brazil and Ecuador. But sources in both Bogota and Caracas tell us that there is no dialogue between Colombia and Venezuela. 2. Repetitive and Tired Responses by National Governments to Organized Crime Threats In the criminal axis of the region -- Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil -- we see little in the way of new approaches to old organized crime problems. Innovation in the violence-wracked countries of Central America's Northern Triangle -- El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras -- is also lacking. Instead we see variations of the same old repressive and militarized responses , which have had little long-term impact on containing, let alone reducing criminal activity over the last decade. Instead, these policies have helped turn Latin America into the most violent region in the world. Colombia's president Ivan Duque, elected on the back of a ""get tough"" security policy , has introduced no novel plans to contain the country's booming cocaine production or a growing cadre of rebel dissidents involved in it. To be sure, Duque's leadership was so weak that after just a few months in office, Colombia sunk into despondency. Mexico's president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, better known as ""AMLO,"" spoke on the campaign trail of some new approaches to fighting crime, including some form of amnesty for low-level criminals and more efforts to rehabilitate prisoners. He also spoke of reducing the role of the military in the struggle against organized crime. Yet AMLO has already started to walk back many of these promises. There is now talk of the creation of a?National Guard composed of police and military that would operate under the Ministry of Defense and take on organized crime. His predecessor, Enrique Pena Nieto, set up a similar body to remarkably little effect. AMLO's proposal will formalize a permanent role for the military in Mexico's domestic security. It will also be costly and slow to implement, requiring changes to the constitution. In Brazil, new President Jair Bolsonaro, a former army officer who has stacked his cabinet with generals, has promised a return to the old days, a vague, bone-chilling statement in a country with a long history of military dictatorships. A supporter of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro poses for a photo with a mock rifle. Credit: AP Photos In terms of actual proposals, he is looking to make gun ownership much easier , ostensibly to arm the ""good guys."" Who will sort the good from the bad guys and prevent weapons from spilling freely onto the black market is not clear. Indeed, the policy may help break the record homicide rate during 2018 in Brazil, which saw an astounding 175 murders a day. Venezuela is home to the most criminalized regime in the region. Not only has the country slid into dictatorship, but senior members of the government of President Nicolas Maduro, including his wife , appear inextricably linked to criminal activity. The exodus provoked by the collapsing economy and repression makes fleeing Venezuelans extremely vulnerable to exploitation and recruitment by organized crime. Venezuelans are seen as expendable labor, prepared to take on far bigger risks for far less reward than others. From harvesting coca leaves to processing cocaine, to piloting the go-fast boats that streak across the Caribbean, to carrying out contract killings, Venezuelans are appearing in the rank and file of all types of criminal enterprises. 3. Top-level corruption The number of current or former Latin American presidents under investigation, or condemned, on charges of corruption is staggering (see illustration). In Peru, five former presidents are under investigation, along with several vice presidents and former ministers. While Peru's case is extreme, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Haiti, and Panama also have former or current presidents under investigation for corruption. Few nations appear exempt from this trend. Tellingly, Venezuela is one of them. The government now presides over rampant criminality and economic collapse. President Nicolas Maduro defeated popular protests intended to topple him in 2017, and in 2018 over a million Venezuelans opted to flee the country. Public anger at corruption has not only resulted in the ousting of presidents, most notably Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in Peru, but brought new ones to power, including AMLO in Mexico and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. Bolsonaro made corruption the central issue of his campaign. ""The evils and harms of corruption affect the population in every way,"" Bolsonaro tweeted on the campaign trail. ""This is what we want to stop."" However, President Bolsonaro appears to have stacked his cabinet with politicians linked to corruption scandals , leaving questions as to whether any real change will come. 4. Booming Criminal Economies Cocaine production is at a record high and the United States is in the grip of its deadliest drug crisis to date with opioids. To give an idea of the criminal earnings from drugs, United Nations figures put annual cocaine production at over 1,400 tons for Colombia and over 600 tons for Bolivia and Peru. With average cocaine prices in the source Andean nations at between $2,000 and $3,000, that generates for criminal groups involved in production around $5 billion. At US wholesale prices that amount of cocaine could net more than $50 billion. At European prices that amount of cocaine could net more than $42 billion, more than Bolivia's entire gross domestic product. Cocaine far outpaces other drugs in terms of earnings, but taken together, earnings from marijuana, heroin and synthetic drugs, could rival cocaine. The drugs are not all leaving Latin America. Domestic consumption of drugs is on the rise, creating new security challenges and giving birth to a new generation of criminal structures. In 2012, Brazil became the second biggest market for cocaine and its derivatives in the world, after the United States. Cocaine use is increasing throughout the region , currently at 0.95 percent of the population, still trailing the United States (1.9 percent) and Western Europe (1.2 percent) but closing the gap. A man mulches coca leaves with a weed whacker in a small makeshift lab in Colombia. Credit: AP Photos Marijuana use in Latin America has been increasing in recent years, and synthetic drugs, which were relatively unknown a decade ago and imported, are now being produced in nations like Colombia and Mexico. Other criminal economies are also growing: illegal mining, extortion, human smuggling, and human trafficking, among others. Mining, especially of gold, is a huge earner for organized crime. Smaller criminal economies persist around copper, coltan, tin, and tungsten. The gold business generates significant criminal income in South America, mainly in Peru, Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela Ecuador, Bolivia, and Guyana. To give an idea of the scale of the trade, in Colombia alone gold mining generates more than $2 billion a year. Just one example of the increasing criminalization of this trade during 2018 could be seen in Venezuela, where amid economic meltdown, the lure of gold created a criminal free for all with high levels of violence. Venezuela's mines have even drawn criminal actors from Colombia looking to cash in. Extortion is hard to measure, as it is extremely under-reported. However, in 2018, we conducted field work studying extortion in Central America (focused on El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama). That field work revealed the epidemic levels of extortion in the Northern Triangle, which underpin the criminal economy of the Mara Salvatrucha ( MS13 ) and the Barrio 18 street gangs. Systematic extortion is also common in many parts of Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil, and is growing in Peru. Human trafficking and smuggling are also on the increase. Most media in 2018 paid more attention to the far smaller migrant ""caravans"" travelling from Central America to the United States, but Venezuela is the greatest driver of this trend. Some three million Venezuelan citizens have fled their homeland since 2015. 5. Agile and Increasingly Clandestine Transnational Organized Crime While government responses to organized crime are stagnant and repetitive, transnational organized crime appears more agile than ever. Riding a wave of increased earnings from drugs, minerals, eco-trafficking and human smuggling, these are boom days for the criminals, with perhaps more space to operate regionally than any time in the last 15 years. We have profiled three criminal structures that have engaged in aggressive expansion in 2018, led by the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC), followed by Colombia's National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) and Mexico's Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion - CJNG). Many of Latin America's criminal structures are largely prison gangs, including the PCC, the Red Command (Comando Vermelho), MS13, and Barrio 18. And repressive policies promise to increase populations in the already overcrowded prison systems in most of Latin America, opening the door for more recruitment. The booming drug trade, particularly cocaine, has attracted international actors to the region. In a lengthy investigation that we will publish in 2019, we have tracked the presence of international mafias, particularly Europeans, that have increased their presence in Latin America, looking to buy drugs at the source, secure reduced prices, and maximize profits. The establishment of legacy mafias from the Old Continent will not only heighten the learning curve for local criminal organizations, it will also increase cooperation and earnings, creating yet greater threats to governments around the region. Global Cocaine Trafficking Flows and Routes (Click on image to enlarge) The criminal ramifications of Venezuela's collapse will also only expand over time. The migration promises a new wave of Venezuelan organized crime structures, who are already taking advantage of the millions of their desperate compatriots spreading across Latin America and further afield. It is, quite simply, a ready-made criminal network, forged by desperation and necessity. Those structures may be some of the most visible, but 2019 also promises some more of the Invisibles -- the sophisticated criminal structures, led mostly by the Colombians who have come to the conclusion that the best protection for their business is not a private army, but anonymity, discrete interactions, and high-level political contacts. These groups minimize violence, maximize corruption and avoid regular channels of communication. These are what we have called the ""Invisibles."" How do you fight an enemy you cannot identify, let alone find? Maybe this year, we'll find out.

"How Venezuelas Stolen Gold Ended Up in Turkey, Uganda and Beyond. What do such distant countries as Venezuela, the Bahamas, Ireland, Morocco, Dubai and Turkey have in common? They were all part of the trade routes for illicit Venezuelan gold in 2018. The Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) sold 73.2 tons of gold in 2018 to two companies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and one in Turkey. The sales took place without the National Assembly's approval, as mandated by Article 187 of the National Constitution. The claim, presented in February 2019 by deputy Carlos Paparoni, president of the National Assembly Finance Commission, recalled there could be no contracts of national public interest with foreign states or companies without the approval of the parliament. *This article was edited for greater clarity and published with the approval of Runrun.es. It does not necessarily represent InSight Crime's opinions. Read the original article here. Runrun had access to leaked documents that detailed how the BCV's gold exited the country throughout 2018. The data was compared with information from Flightradar24.com , a public website with real-time information about global air traffic, allowing the verification of each flight's routes and reference numbers. Some of these transfers of gold were made on private aircraft but others went aboard commercial Turkish Airlines flights from Caracas to Istanbul. According to the customs records accessed by Runrun, 73,2 tons of gold bars were sold between the Emirati company Noor Capital (27.396 tons), the Turkish company, Sardes Kiymetli Madenler A.S (23.994 tons), and a Belgian firm based in the United Arab Emirates, Goetz Gold LLC (21.886 tons). A total of 33 gold bar shipments were transported on 27 Turkish Airlines, and five on Copa Airlines (Panama), Solar Cargo (Venezuela), Rotana Jet Airlines and E-Cargo Airlines (both from the UAE). Only one of the 33 flights has not yet been identified. The total of gold exported by the BCV in 2018 was eight times higher than the 8.65 tons of internal gold production registered in Venezuela up to May 2018. It is unknown whether the 73 tons exported by Venezuela during 2018 came from the BCV's reserves or from unreported production in the Orinoco Mining Arc. Although there has been a 56 percent fall in gold reserves since Nicolas Maduro took office in 2013, there was a slight increase of 11 tons 150,216 gold tons in January to 161,22 tons in September 2018, according to data from the World Gold Council. These numbers include the 8,6 tons registered by the BCV as 2018's internal production. ""Blood Gold"" is Booming Business 21.8 of the 73.2 gold tons exported by the BCV in 2018 were bought by Goetz Gold LLC, a Belgian company with offices in Dubai, and which is facing severe scrutiny. It is being investigated by anti-corruption agencies in Europe and Africa for trading in ""blood gold"", defined as metal extracted in areas of conflict, financing crime and wars, and promoting the violation of human rights. Goetz Gold LLC is part of the Tony Goetz group , headquartered in Antwerp, Belgium, known as the global capital of the diamond trade. Goetz Gold is under suspicion for being part of an illegal trafficking network of conflict minerals. The company exports gold to Europe and the US processed by the African company African Gold Refinery (AGR) in Uganda, the largest refinery in sub-Saharan Africa and completely owned by the Belgian consortium. Part of the material this factory uses to produce their gold bars comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where the vast majority of mining activity is illegal and serves as a financing source for the purchase of arms. These accusations are based on the compelling investigation, ""The Golden Laundromat"", published in October 2018 by The Sentry. This is an anticorruption organization based in Washington DC, which monitors businesses contributing to violence in Africa, co-founded by US actor George Clooney. But the gold refined by the AGR does not only come from their African neighbors. Recently, the Ugandan company admitted to receiving material from an unspecified country in South America. The Ugandan official media indicated this country could be Venezuela, where the government currently relies on gold sales to obtain liquidity amid its collapsed economy and to avoid sanctions imposed by the US and Europe. On March 13, police authorities in Uganda announced they were investigating the legality of an import of 7.4 tons of gold to the Ugandan refinery made in March 2019 with an estimated value of US$300 million. Goetz Gold bought 21.8 tons of gold from Venezuela in 2018, which represented 30 percent all international sales of gold by the central bank. The largest single shipment of 15.6 tons happened on December 3, 2018, shortly after the US announced sanctions on anyone carrying out transactions involving Venezuelan gold. The gold sourced by Goetz Gold was transported from Maiquetia Airport by Emirati airline Rotana Jet and Russian airline E-Cargo, neither of which have commercial flights from Venezuela. Runrun.es attempted to confirm these facts with Goetz Gold president, Alain Goetz, in February 2019 but received no answer. Turkey and Unrefined Gold Almost 24 tons of Venezuelan gold (23.994 kilograms) had left for Istanbul onboard 28 flights executed between January and September 2018, as stated in the leaked information obtained by Runrun.es. After departing from Venezuela, the ""blood gold"" -extracted from deposits being controlled by criminal groups, where massacres are known to take place and workers who disagree are often murdered- was taken on by the private Turkish company Sardes Kiymetli Madenler A.S. This company had a sales agreement with Maduro, through the BCV, according to the revelation made by deputy Carlos Paparoni in early February. The documents indicate that each of the Sardes flights transported between 226 and 3,721 kilograms of gold. Most of the 27 flights were by Turkish Airlines, which started operating in Venezuela in 2016 and since increased weekly flights from Caracas to Istanbul from three to five. Only one of the flights involved another airline, Panama's Copa Airlines, which transported 543 kilograms of gold on March 20, 2018. Even though Copa denied involvement in of this flight, this itinerary's explanation can be found in the code share agreement between Turkish and Copa Airlines , signed in April 2017. Both companies are members of the global airline network Star Alliance. Every week, a number of Copa flights depart from Maiquetia, transfer in Panama and continue to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines aircraft. The March 20 flight was one such occasion. The majority of gold transfers, 23 out of 28, happened during the first half of the year. By May 2018, 21.3 tons had already been transferred to Istanbul at a value of US$779 million. Reuters confirmed the shipments reached a value of US$900 million for the entire year. Last July, Venezuela's minister in charge of mining development, Victor Cano, acknowledged that the central bank had begun exporting gold to Turkey to be refined there, a process that had not happened in the past. There are no reports of this gold returning to Venezuela. Venezuela had previously sent gold to be refined in Venezuela but US sanctions caused the European country to draw back from this practice. This is not the first time that Turkey has established commercial relations with countries sanctioned by the US Treasury Department. Iran is one such case, which according to Bloomberg , buys billions of dollars of oil from Venezuela. The money from these transactions goes to Turkish accounts where it is ""trapped"" due to international restrictions. Previously, however, gold was also used in trade with Iran. A BBC story revealed suspicions about the presence of Venezuelan gold in Iran. *This article was edited for greater clarity and published with the approval of Runrun.es.

"Ecuador Emerges as Trafficking Hub for Perus Illegal Gold. An investigation in Ecuador has revealed how the country has become a major transit hub for illegal Peruvian gold exported to the United States, an evolution directly linked to Peru's attempts to crack down on gold trafficking. Case files obtained by El Comercio have exposed the inner workings of the alleged illegal gold trafficking network exposed last month after a series of raids and arrests linked to two gold exporters, Clearprocess and Spartan. According to El Comercio, prosecutors allege the two companies employed emissaries to strike deals with Peruvian gold smugglers on the border between the two countries. The companies then exported the gold. Prosecutors allege the precious metal's illegal and foreign origins were concealed using falsified documents and identities stolen from legally registered Ecuadorians, El Comercio reported. After 2013, the two companies grew rapidly to become Ecuador's principal gold exporters, according to a statement issued by the government , which named their main customers as the US-based companies Republic Metals Corporation (RMC), Kaloti Metals and Logistics (KML), and Mvp Imports. Police arrested seven executives from Clearprocess and Spartan in the June raids, and they have since been charged with money laundering, El Comercio reported. The emergence of Ecuador as a transit point for Peruvian gold is a direct consequence of Peru's attempts to introduce traceability into its supply chain and prevent illegal gold from being laundered into the legal supply. Until 2012, there was little oversight of gold exports in Peru, but new legislation and a shift in security priorities to focus on illegal mining led to high profile seizures and investigations, and by 2014 half of all Peru's gold exporters had fallen under suspicion. In 2015, Peruvian investigators told InSight Crime this had resulted in a shift in trafficking patterns, with illegal gold increasingly smuggled across the border into Bolivia then exported with false paperwork identifying its origins as Bolivian. This pattern now appears to be repeating itself in Ecuador, with both countries showing the telltale discrepancy between gold mined in the country and gold exported -- in Ecuador's case a $949 million gap in the period 2012-2014, according to government figures. While the export patterns in the regional gold trade are changing, the same names continue to surface as the international buyers of this allegedly illegal gold. RMC, for example has been embroiled in several illegal mining scandals in Colombia. The owners of one of its former suppliers, Goldex, are currently on trial for money laundering, while another, Giraldo y Duque is under investigation. As a result, the company has scaled back its operations in Colombia and now only buys from one mining company with a legal title. KML, meanwhile, has been named as the intended recipient of allegedly illegal gold seized in Peru and has had ties to several exporters suspected of money laundering and linked to alleged organized crime kingpins. InSight Crime's reporting of these connections has led to threats of legal action from Kaloti. RMC Responds: Following publication of this article, RMC contacted InSight Crime to request a clarification on the company's current gold buying policy, which was developed in response to the scandals in Colombia and growing concerns over gold trafficking and money laundering in the Americas. Jason Rubin, RMC's CEO, said: ""RMC has ceased doing business with any aggregators as part of its continuing efforts to prevent gold operations from being used for money laundering. RMC only deals with single source mining entities. RMC made this decision to address some of the problems you discuss in the Article, including exporters attempting to conceal the illegal and foreign origins of gold using falsified documents. RMC recognizes the challenges facing the gold industry and, as a responsible refinery, is attempting to lead by example when it comes to thwarting illegal gold trafficking networks."""	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"New Video Appears of Hit Squad in Mine-Rich Mexico Region. A new video of a caravan of hitmen in northern Mexican offers a rare view of the fighting forces of Mexico's criminal organizations, and may reflect the ongoing incursion of organized crime into mining, hydrocarbon exploration, and other industries. The video uploaded to YouTube (see below) last week features an unidentified cameraman walking alongside a resting convoy of about 15 trucks and SUVs, all of which were carrying well armed men. The cameraman repeated the phrase ""Animo, sicarios"" -which, translated loosely, means ""Let's go get 'em, hitmen"" -- on various occasions, and the group appeared to be pausing on its way to battle. That is because they were. Proceso reported that some of the vehicles in the video, which was filmed from a highway in Chihuahua's Sierra Tarahumara region, were recovered from the scene of a November 2014 shootout in Samachique, Chihuahua, which ended with the death of dozens, although only eight bodies were recovered by authorities. Some of the men who appeared were reportedly also killed in a March 2015 gunfight in a nearby ranch. While it is unclear which group the gunmen represented, the battles to which they have been linked pitted Gente Nueva, the Sinaloa Cartel's local allies, against La Linea, the fighting force aligned with the Juarez Cartel during the last decade. The video and the stories around the group are noteworthy for a number of reasons. They show that La Linea, whose erstwhile patron has been arrested and which has suffered from years of government pursuit , remains a significant actor in a key section of the country. (The mountainous regions of western Chihuahua include productive areas of cultivation for poppy and marijuana.) The group is still participating in massive engagements, despite having lost its most important base of operations in Juarez. While the Sinaloa Cartel was credited with defeating La Linea and its allies in Juarez, the group, which has also suffered its own setbacks, has been unable to stamp out all opposition. Reports of the Sinaloa Cartel fighting with enemies -- often weakened adversaries all but left for dead, like the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) and La Linea -- in the mountainous sections of Sinaloa, Chihuahua, and Durango have been common. The video also offers a clear demonstration of Mexican criminal groups' level of impunity, sophistication, and firepower. The approximately 15 vehicles collectively held perhaps 50 individuals, equivalent to a large army platoon. As noted above, most were heavily armed. One fighter appeared to be toting a .50 caliber machine gun outfitted with a bipod, and the video seemed to indicate that a team was dedicated to manning the gun. Despite the conspicuousness that a convoy of machine-gun toting hitmen parked along a highway inherently implies, none of the men appeared particularly worried about being detected. On the contrary, the men operated as though they were the owners of the territory, despite having illegal weapons and committing other violations. Such boldness speaks to an expectation of impunity among criminal groups that is at the heart of their threat to Mexico. Some analyses of the episode have theorized that the incidents are tied to the rising interest of organized crime to resource extraction in the region. Journalist Shannon Young, a foreign correspondent based in Mexico, pointed out that mining and energy interests in the Sierra Tarahumara, as in much of the nation, have seen a substantial uptick in the involvement of criminal organizations. Massive shows of force and the collusion of local authorities, both of which were implicit or explicit in the video, have been vital to gangs' muscling in on the sorts of big, politically connected businesses that tend to manage resource concessions. It's not clear that the individuals in the video nor the subsequent firefights had any direct tie to natural resource disputes, but the problem in Mexico, grown more severe in recent years. In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal , Manuel Reyes, president of the Mexican Association of Mining, Metallurgical, and Geological Engineers, said that organized crime has ""besieged"" his industry. The newly formed gendarmerie, a centerpiece of President Enrique Pena Nieto's security policy, was redesigned specifically to focus on mining and other strategic industries. On many occasions, the tensions between criminal groups and mining companies have led to violence or some sort of accommodation. One of the most prominent such cases was the Knights Templars' alleged murder in 2013 of Virgilio Camacho , an executive at ArcelorMittal, the steel producer with a massive plant in Lazaro Cardenas. More recently, Canadian mine owner Rob McEwan, whose Sinaloa mines were the target of a successful gold theft worth more than $8 million earlier this year, spoke candidly of his firm's collaborative relationship with local drug traffickers. In Guerrero, currently one of Mexico's most dangerous regions, criminal groups' attacks on mines have grown more frequent as well. In February, 12 employees of the mine Media Luna were reportedly kidnapped. One month later, four Guerrero-based employees of the Canadian firm Goldcorp were also kidnapped. One was subsequently released, while the three others were tortured and killed."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Perus Mining Mafia Seek To Legalize Their Operations. Peruvian ""mafias"" with extensive illegal mining interests are seeking to formalize those operations, according to the government, drawing attention to the fine line between informal and illegal mining. A report by El Comercio newspaper describes how various ""gold capos"" are on a government list of concession title holders, aiming to convert their criminal operations into legal ones. On the list are the names Gregoria Casas Huamanhuillca, alias ""Goya"", and Cecilio Baca Fernandez, alias ""Baca,"" an ex-husband and wife whom El Comercio describes as ""founding the empire of illegal mining,"" and who have been investigated for money laundering. Environment Minister Manuel Pulgar-Vidal acknowledged that the names had been included, but blamed it on ""errors that regional governments make"" and said they must be removed. However the regional director from the Energy and Mines Ministry, Milner Oyola, told El Comercio that Baca and his family were among 5,000 informal miners who had completed the necessary procedures in the formalization process. ""Everyone has equal rights and they shouldn't be excluded."" It was also reported that six men and four women had been caught at Lima's Jorge Chavez airport carrying more than $4 million in illegal mining profits in their suitcases. Illegal mining is huge business in Peru, estimated last year to be worth more financially than the cocaine trade. That does not mean it is more of a security issue. Although there have been some reports of links between the illegal mining sector and drug trafficking groups, the trade is not dominated by criminal groups as it is in other countries, particularly Colombia. Instead, in Peru much of it is simply informal, a somewhat inevitable situation in areas where there is no state presence. Madre de Dios, a southeastern jungle region which is Peru's gold mining heartland, has few roads, no fiscal controls and no banks, yet more than $27 million dollars is estimated to move through just one department in the area monthly. Baca and Casas are thought to control more than 2,000 hectares of illegal mining in the region. While debatable to what extent criminal groups are involved, it's undeniable that informal gold mining has devastated thousands of hectares of Peruvian rainforest and employs thousands of people in highly unsafe conditions , generating huge personal -- and illegal profits -- for barons such as Baca and Goya, and so any moves to formalize the sector should be welcomed."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Ecuador Continues to Struggle Against Narco Flights. Ecuador launched an operation in early April to seize an illegal landing strip, thought to be linked to planes carrying drug shipments, but such isolated responses are unlikely to stem the flow of narco flights. Ecuador's police launched Operation Aeronave on April 1, when a plane was seen making an unauthorized landing on a piece of land belonging to an oil refinery in the province of Manabi. The plane, thought to be carrying a shipment of drugs, managed to take off again while nine men who were standing guard opened fire on the police. The alleged drug traffickers involved were arrested, with two of them later confirmed as active police officers. While the plane escaped, the police seized around $200,000, four firearms and a number of vehicles. General Marco Villegas, the head of Ecuador's anti-narcotics strategy, told Democracia TV that drug trafficking groups prioritize areas such as the refinery for narco flights as there are both paved roads for easy access and ample vegetation to mask the landings. Narco flights are hardly new in Ecuador. In March, an aircraft carrying over 35 kilos of cocaine chlorhydrate crashed in Montecristi. Between 2003 and 2019, Ecuadorean authorities have seized or downed 19 planes carrying drugs, seizing over 900 kilos of drugs. However, with an estimated 2,500 private landing strips across the country, these may have been a mere a drop in the ocean. Despite the efforts made to tackle the issue, aerial drug trafficking remains an Achilles heel for Ecuador and many Latin American countries. Operation Conquistador in January showed that joint military operations and intelligence sharing may find some success, after a transnational criminal organization who sent drugs by plane from Ecuador to Mexico was dismantled by authorities from both countries. After the murder of three staff from the El Comercio newspaper along the Ecuador-Colombia border in 2018, the two countries increased security cooperation , especially along the Pacific Coast and the border between Narino and Esmeraldas. However, flights continue to offer a convenient way for drug traffickers to circumvent any effective supervision. And with a reported 2,500 private landing strips across Ecuador, meaningful strategies to prevent them may be hard to come by. A lack of appropriate technology and training has been a consistent problem. This year, Paraguay lost track of a narco flight and admitted it had neither the capacity to track or shoot down such planes. Ecuador has invested in technologies capable of intercepting some illegal flights. In 2009, it bought Chinese radars that were later replaced in 2016 by the ones produced by a Spanish company. However, the escape of the plane during Operation Aeronave highlighted the persistent inadequacy of Ecuadorean security measures and technologies.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Politics, Starvation and Colombias Thriving Illicit Gas Trade. The presidents of Colombia and Venezuela have reiterated their promise to crack down on contraband along their shared border. At the center of the crisis is the perennial illegal trade in cheap Venezuelan gasoline through the Colombian border province of La Guajira, where drought and starvation demonstrate just how little of the trafficking wealth trickles down. President Juan Manuel Santos met this week with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to discuss measures to stem the illicit flow of products across the two countries' border. This may include Venezuela raising the price of gasoline in order to reduce the incentive for smuggling. However, the criminal, political and social dynamics in the region are likely to serve as major obstacles to any such efforts, with an extremely corrupt local government and a population ready to strongly resist attempts to halt the illegal fuel trade. What's more, a humanitarian crisis is brewing in La Guajira, the epicenter of the illegal gasoline trade. An average of two children die each day , principally of malnutrition and treatable diseases, in a situation one US pediatrician compared to Ethiopia. This crisis has been exacerbated by an ongoing drought and restrictions placed on food exports from Venezuela , but is also fueled by the complete absence of state services in a region where the elements of the local authorities work hand in hand with the criminals who run the gasoline trade. According to Colombian newsweekly Semana , the gasoline trade in La Guajira -- which shares a border with Venezuela -- is now worth up to $2.6 billion a year. Authorities estimate that 1.5 million gallons of fuel enter Colombia via La Guajira daily, and that 15 percent of all fuel sold in Colombia is contraband, reported Semana. The regional trade in contraband fuel has existed for many years. However, Semana's research highlights how this has morphed from a small-scale criminal activity controlled largely by members of the Wayuu indigenous group into a massive illicit industry run by armed criminals who operate with impunity. The caravans carrying gasoline into Venezuela are now made up of as many as 150 vehicles, including tankers capable of carrying 4,000 gallons. These ""caravans of death"" -- so-called because of the high risk of an explosion as they travel at top speeds on back roads -- move in broad daylight and refuse to stop at checkpoints. Semana recounted one incident in which gasoline smugglers entering the country from Venezuela ran over a high-level customs official when asked to stop. There have been other cases of officials shot at or killed. The caravans also include what are known as ""kamikazes,"" operatives who carry firearms with the intention of blowing up any gas loads that are stopped. Smugglers pay off scouts to inform them of any potential trouble coming their way. Despite the suspected size of the trade, officials seized just 123,000 gallons of gasoline in La Guajira's three principal cities between December 2013 and June this year. Only 162 police are assigned to patrol the border, which has some 192 illegal crossings. Police also lack the power to stop contraband gasoline sales within the province. Indigenous communities in the area organize against them, and certain territories are off-limits because they are controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Thanks to its strategic location on the Venezuelan border, the coal-rich province of La Guajira has long been an important center for the contraband trade in products ranging from clothing and food to drugs, arms and gasoline. The profit margins for the illegal fuel trade are huge, given that gasoline can be bought for under 10 cents a gallon in Venezuela and resold for over $4 in Colombian cities. The trade is an important source of income for many in the region. RCN reported in 2012 that an estimated 25,000 families in La Guajira and the neighboring Cesar province lived off the contraband gas trade. The trade was traditionally controlled by certain families of the indigenous Wayuu ethnicity. This changed over time, however, and by the 1990s two paramilitary leaders from the Northern Bloc of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) -- Hernan Giraldo and Rodrigo Tovar Pupo, alias ""Jorge 40"" -- were competing for control of the region. Jorge 40's victorious paramilitary faction began calling themselves the Wayuu Counter-Insurgency Front and took over Ayatawacoop -- a fusion of three Wayuu cooperatives dedicated to gasoline transport, storage and distribution. Ayatawacoop became a key cog in Jorge 40's business, allowing him to legitimize illicit funds and activities. During this time, the contraband gasoline trade expanded. Jorge 40 began to ship Ayatawacoop fuel outside La Guajira, and charged a ""security tax"" from drivers of both legal and illegal fuel shipments. Since the formal dismantling of the AUC and the 2008 extradition of Jorge 40, the criminal landscape in La Guajira has changed again. The dismantling of the AUC saw the emergence of various BACRIM (from the Spanish ""bandas criminales,"" meaning criminal bands). As of 2011, intelligence sources had identified five such groups operating there. Since then, key criminal leaders have fallen , and Colombia's most powerful BACRIM crime syndicate, the Urabenos, appears to have seized near-total control of the region , though their power is still contested in some areas by their greatly weakened rivals, the Rastrojos. Marcos de Jesus Figueroa Garcia, alias ""Marquitos,"" is the nominal head of the Urabenos in much of the region, according to Semana. Marquitos, of Wayuu descent, is a powerful Guajira underworld figure who has developed a number of close political ties, most notably with ex-Governor Juan Francisco Gomez, better known as ""Kiko Gomez,"" who was arrested last year for alleged BACRIM ties and accused of various murders. Marquitos (pictured here) began as the head of security for a powerful local businessman with strong paramilitary connections, and later created his own criminal group dedicated to drug and gas smuggling that included longstanding contraband heavyweights. This group is thought to have been largely absorbed into the Urabenos structure. An underworld contact in La Guajira told InSight Crime that Marquitos remains a key player in the province for drug trafficking and other criminal activities, but that he had fled to Venezuela following Gomez's arrest -- news also reported by El Tiempo -- from where he was running his criminal empire. Marquitos has a $150,000 price on his head. The FARC also operates in La Guajira. The guerrilla group's 59th Front has established itself in several rural sectors outside the cities of Maicao and Albania, taxing contraband gas shipments. The group reportedly charges around $500 for tankers carrying 3,000-7,000 gallons crossing the border into Colombia, and lower sums for smaller vehicles. Police say there is also evidence that smugglers pay the FARC for armed assistance -- one 2013 attack that resulted in the deaths of three tax and customs police was attributed to the 59th Front. The BACRIM also tax gas smugglers. This is reportedly done once the caravans take off along nearly 200 routes headed to various parts of the province. However, the BACRIM also offer up vehicles and logistical support to smugglers, and most contraband runners now reportedly work directly with them. Additionally, Marquitos allegedly uses the gas tanks of outbound vehicles to traffic cocaine into Venezuela, before they return full of fuel. Failure to cooperate with the FARC and the BACRIM can be deadly for the ""pimpineros"" -- the people who buy the smuggled gasoline once it has crossed the border. Between the beginning of 2012 and mid-2013, six pimpineros were murdered for not making the required payments. In La Guajira, the criminal world is nearly inseparable from the political, and the support of local officials is an important part of what has allowed the region's criminal activities -- including the fuel trade -- to flourish. In his time, Jorge 40 had corrupt officials from the intelligence and migration agency (DAS) and the customs police (DIAN) behind him, ensuring investigations into Ayatawacoop's activities would fall flat. All three of the region's principal political movements have alleged ties to criminal groups. As well as being linked to Marquitos, former Governor Kiko Gomez was allegedly a local contraband boss involved in the gasoline trade before coming to office, and negotiated a power-sharing agreement with Jorge 40's paramilitaries. Kiko Gomez's political rivals in the New La Guajira Movement have been linked to Rastrojos drug money, in addition to the now-dismantled BACRIM of Alta La Guajira -- the remnants of which are believed to have been absorbed by the Urabenos -- and Jorge 40's AUC unit. A university director in La Guajira recently claimed that he had received death threats from the movement, and referred to them as the ""BACRIM Nueva La Guajira."" The third political structure in the province is run by current Partido de La U Senator Jorge Ballesteros. It is allied with Kiko Gomez's structure, and has been linked to former local contraband leader Samuel Santander Lopesierra, known as the ""Marlboro Man."" This toxic mix of organized crime and politics has given rise to a thriving criminal industry, but the profits have clearly remained in the hands of the political and criminal elite at the expense of the rural poor."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Brazil Cigarette Seizures Highlight Paraguay Contraband Trade. Authorities in Brazil seized over eight million packs of contraband cigarettes in just one state in 2013, providing an indication of the size of the trade in black market tobacco from Paraguay, which has been linked to that country's president. Brazilian police confiscated the cigarettes in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in the southernmost part of the country, reported G1 Globo. These black market cigarettes are reportedly smuggled from Paraguay in cargo trucks, and are also trafficked across Lake Itaipu -- which stretches along the border between the two countries -- from the Paraguayan city Salto del Guaira to the Brazilian city of Guaira. According to Brazil's federal police, contraband cigarettes have been discovered in trucks carrying corn, cotton and rice as well as inside the refrigerated chambers of vehicles used to transport chicken and beef. A member of the federal police force in Guaira said limited manpower and technology in the region made it difficult for police to catch smugglers. He explained that contraband traffickers had effective scouting systems that enabled them to evade the police and return to Paraguay if they were spotted on the lake by Brazilian authorities. The tri-border area of Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina where the cigarette crossing is located is a hub for contraband goods, a status facilitated by the large number of unregistered products flowing through Paraguay. In 2013, Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes estimated that for every million dollars in products entering Paraguay , only $10,000-worth was declared. Among other things, Paraguay is a major regional supplier of black market cigarettes, many of which have been linked to tobacco company Tabesa , owned by President Cartes. In addition to Brazil, these shipments have ended up in Colombia, Argentina and Bolivia, where over 1,000 crates of Paraguayan cigarettes were seized in one case in 2012. Although a lucrative trade in and of itself, trafficking contraband cigarettes is also attractive to criminal groups because this activity can be used to launder money from drug proceeds. Earlier this year, an international investigation revealed that Colombian criminal groups, principally the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and a faction of the Urabenos, were selling trafficked Tabesa cigarettes for this reason. It is possible that something similar occurs with cigarette trafficking into Brazil, and the trade may well be linked to criminal groups like the Red Command and the First Capital Command (PCC), which have an established a presence in Paraguay .	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Just Before Carnival, Colombia Police Seize Contraband Booze. Colombia police seized over $400,000 worth of contraband liquor smuggled from Venezuela, reportedly intended to keep revellers tipsy during the Barranquilla Carnival. Police found 1,500 boxes of contraband liquor hidden in a truck traveling from the western border city Cucuta, according to El Espectador. The find included over 15,000 bottles of wine, tequila, gin, rum and whiskey, apparently en route to Barranquilla, which hosts one of the world's largest carnival celebrations in February. Colombia has a thriving illicit liquor trade , with over 40,000 contraband bottles seized last year. Away from the border regions, the liquor trade typically involves groups selling diluting booze or other bootleg versions of popular alcohol brands. But much of the trade is concentrated in border cities like Cucuta, where many families make a living from smuggling all kinds of untaxed goods. Because such small-time smuggling supports so many communities, authorities are reluctant to crack down on the activity and anger local residents. Additionally, officers in Colombia's border police accept bribes from contraband smugglers as part of the job. Because the price of some basic goods, including alcohol, is lower in Venezuela than in Colombia, this also gives plenty of incentives to contraband runners. The more profitable smuggling networks along the Venezuela-Colombia involve gasoline, drugs and automobiles. These are the networks traditionally controlled by the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia ( AUC ) and their criminal heirs the BACRIMs. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
US Tightens Controls at Texas-Mexico Border. The U.S. Border and Customs Protection agency will open seven new control booths along the border with Mexico at the crossing in Nuevo Laredo, Texas, the Associated Press reports. The U.S. Transport Department says that this border crossing has more commercial traffic than any other point in the almost 2,000 mile border. Some 60 percent of all cargo trucks that go between Texas and Mexico pass through this point, and there is a lot of contraband smuggled amongst this large amount of legal cargo. This makes Nuevo Laredo a very vulnerable point, exploited by Mexican drug trafficking organizations to export cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamines into the U.S. The new booths, which will monitor traffic coming from Mexico, are aimed at stopping contraband coming into the U.S. InSight considers that more effort should also be made to control cargo headed to Mexico such as ammunition, arms , and bulk cash. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Capture of Venezuela Megabanda in Peru is Ominous Sign for Region. The recent capture of several members of a Venezuela criminal group in Peru illustrates how criminals in the troubled Andean nation are migrating and sometimes carrying their criminal habits with them. On August 3, authorities in Peru detained five members of a dangerous Venezuelan criminal organization, or what is commonly referred to as a "" mega-gang ,"" known as the Train of Aragua (El Tren de Aragua) that operates in one of Venezuela's central coastal states, El Nacional reported. According to Juan Carlos Sotil, the head of the Criminal Investigation Directorate (Direccion de Investigacion Criminal - DIRINCRI) at Peru's National Police, at least 15 Train of Aragua members have entered the country in recent weeks, El Universal reported. ""They have come to Peru to commit a series of crimes, primarily against financial institutions, [and] to establish a headquarters for their criminal organization,"" Sotil said during a press conference, El Siglo reported. Authorities arrested the five individuals after a follow-up investigation in the North Plaza shopping center in the Pacific port city of Callao, just west of the capital Lima. The individuals had a map of a bank they were allegedly going to rob, as well as guns and a type of grenade commonly used by criminals in Venezuela. Among those detained was Edinson Agustin Barreda, alias ""Catire,"" who confessed to being a member of the group. He has allegedly participated in at least six murders in Venezuela, according to Peru 21. Barreda also reportedly recorded his crimes and shared images of his decapitated victims. Since the start of mass migration of Venezuelans to places like Aruba, Panama, Colombia and the United States, migrants have been captured committing petty crimes. However, the capture of several Train of Aragua members in Peru and the suspicion that they were trying to set up shop in the country is the first sign of the possible expansion of Venezuelan organized crime groups in the region. The Train has more than 200 members who operate on the streets and thousands more that work from within Venezuela's prisons, including Hector Guerrero, alias ""Nino,"" the group's leader who is serving time in the Tocoron prison where he is the shot-caller, or "" pran , "" as they are known inside the jails. Over the course of the last six years, Guerrero has strengthened the group from behind bars. He has planned kidnappings, assassinations, extortions, and robberies, while also controlling microtrafficking and the safe passage of drugs passing through the heart of the country from neighboring Colombia. This shows that -- just like in other prisons across the region -- the criminal activities of some criminal groups do not stop while their members are in prison. In fact, in some occasions they are strengthened and expanded into other territories when crime groups are able to convert prisons into their own operational centers , often as a result of inaction on the part of authorities and the complicity of corrupt officials. Guerrero is considered one of the pranes ""spoiled by the [Venezuelan] government and [Prison Minister] Iris Valera,"" according to a report from El Estimulo. In 2016, authorities promised to implement a new system in the Tocoron prison in which the state exerts control and prisoners do not have any privileges, according to El Estimulo. However, Guerrero continues to be the governing force in the prison two years later. Venezuela's political crisis has spurred massive migration. According to the Venezuelan criminologist Fermin Marmol Garcia, who studies the mega-bands, it's possible that members of these criminal groups -- who are also affected by the country's troubled state -- migrate to other countries to revive their criminal activities as a form of survival. ""Venezuela is a country without any restraint, without any controls on migration or the movement of goods by land, and this is the route that the Train of Aragua members are using. This situation favors organized crime,"" he told InSight Crime. ""Since 2014, there have been reports that not only professionals are emigrating from Venezuela, but that there has been an exodus of criminals leaving with the intention of exporting their modus operandi. This is why it is necessary that investigative police networks are established in the region to share information about these organizations,"" Marmol Garcia added. In recent weeks, authorities in Peru have also captured members from other Venezuelan criminal groups involved in a variety of crimes. Peru's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has allegedly received a list of at least 15 ""new"" Venezuelan criminals that are in the country, the PanAm Post reported."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mapping Colombias Drug Trafficking Diaspora. From the jungles of Brazil to the elegant boulevards of Madrid, some of Colombia's most renowned drug traffickers of recent memory have been captured abroad, a sign of how the country's criminal groups are extending their tentacles across Latin America and into Europe. There's a long history of Colombian drug trafficking groups operating in foreign locales. Indeed, Colombian drug traffickers getting arrested abroad is almost as old as large-scale, international drug trafficking itself. In 1991, 9,714 Colombians were detained outside their home country on drug trafficking charges, an average of 27 arrests per day. Colombia's underworld has changed significantly since the early 1990s, when powerful drug cartels still dominated the landscape. Colombian groups have since ceded their top spot in the pecking order of Latin American organized crime to their counterparts in Mexico. As a result, a fair amount of the attention from US authorities and others has justifiably shifted from Colombia to Mexico. However, Colombia's role in the international drug trade should not be discounted. While the newest generation of criminal groups does not possess the same firepower as their predecessors, they continue to expand their networks into various parts of Latin America and Europe. In the last five years, some of the most important figures in Colombia's underworld have been captured elsewhere. (See map below) Two recent arrests illustrate the extent to which one particular group, the Urabenos, has exported its criminal franchising model abroad. In early June, Colombia's National Police arrested Wilmar Yuriano Valencia Estrada, alias ""The Specialist,"" who was reportedly the Urabenos point man in Argentina. Authorities in the southwest city of Cali also arrested ""Duque,"" allegedly the head of the Urabenos in Spain who was in charge of expanding the organization's presence throughout the continent. Below, InSight Crime provides a brief overview of the role Colombian organized crime has played in four highlighted nations, as well as some of the emblematic players who have been captured in these countries. Argentina For at least the past decade , several high-level Colombian drug traffickers have used Argentina as a refuge in order to escape intense security pressure back home. In 2010 the Urabenos leadership reportedly sent one of their top operators, Henry de Jesus Lopez, alias "" Mi Sangre ,"" to Argentina to protect him from Colombian security forces. Mi Sangre, who had a long criminal career that stretched back to his days working for the Medellin-based Oficina de Envigado, was eventually captured in Buenos Aires in October 2012. Colombian capos are not just interested in Argentina because it serves as a convenient hide-out. Narcos have taken advantage of the growth in Argentina's domestic drug consumption by selling their product locally in order to finance cocaine shipments destined for the more lucrative European markets. Drug traffickers have also laundered large sums of illicit cash in Argentina, which has long struggled to keep drug money out of its financial system. Interestingly, warring drug lords have used Argentina as a rendezvous point. In 2011 two of Colombia's top drug traffickers at the time, Maximiliano Bonilla Orozco, alias "" Valenciano ,"" and Erick Vargas Cardenas, alias "" Sebastian ,"" reportedly met in the city of Rosario to negotiate a truce. Valenciano and Sebastian were leaders of rival factions of the Oficina who were fighting for control of Medellin's underworld. Venezuela Sharing a long and poorly regulated border with Colombia, Venezuela has served as a key drug storage and transshipment point for some of Colombia's most important drug trafficking organizations. Daniel ""El Loco"" Barrera, who has been described as the closest thing to a modern-day Pablo Escobar in Colombia, is believed to have ran his vast drug empire out of western Venezuela for several years before his September 2012 capture in the town of San Cristobal. Just a few months earlier the founder of the Rastrojos criminal organization, Diego Perez Henao, alias "" Diego Rastrojo ,"" was arrested on a farm in the western state of Barinas. Corruption within the Venezuelan security forces is a key drawing point for Colombian groups. In 2008, the US Treasury accused a high-ranking Venezuelan military official -- and future Defense Minister -- of helping Colombian rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ) smuggle cocaine into Venezuela. More recently, US authorities have said the one-time head of Venezuela's military intelligence was on the payroll of a high-level Colombian drug trafficker. Panama In prior decades Colombian criminal groups used Panama as their unofficial bank, with lax banking regulations and corrupt officials facilitating the influx of huge amounts of illicit cash into the country. The country was so rife with drug corruption that in 1988 then-US Senator John Kerry christened Panama a "" narco-kleptocracy ."" Although Panama has cut down on narco-corruption, the country remains a strategic stopover point for Colombian drug shipments heading north. The FARC's 57th Front maintains a presence on both sides of the Colombia-Panama border, and uses the huge swath of undeveloped forest area known as the Darien Gap as a base for its drug trafficking operations. Colombia's neo-paramilitary groups also have high-level operatives stationed in Panama. In April of this year, Panamanian authorities captured Alejandro Quintero Otalvaro, alias ""El Paisa,"" a leader of the Urabenos who was one of Colombia's most wanted men. Spain Colombian organized crime is believed to dominate the cocaine trade in Spain. During field research two years ago, Spanish police told InSight Crime there were between 12 and 20 active Colombian ""oficinas de cobro,"" which act as unofficial arbiters of the underworld. The ringleader of an Urabenos oficina de cobro and several of his lieutenants were captured in May 2014 during simultaneous raids in Madrid, Toledo and Barcelona. Criminal groups such as the Rastrojos have also sent top-level hit men across the Atlantic to serve as enforcers, while Spanish authorities arrested an Oficina de Envigado emissary in July 2014. Spain serves as a natural springboard for Colombia-based groups looking to move cocaine into other parts of Europe, as there is already a sizeable Colombian population and no language barrier. Moving forward, Colombia's influence in the Spanish and European underworld could be set to grow. As of December 2015 Colombians are exempt from the Schengen visa requirement, which could enable criminal groups -- and the product they smuggle -- to move more freely around the Old Continent."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Brazilian Gang Runs Cocaine Trade in Perus Rebel Heartland. An emerging criminal group from Brazil may control up to 60 percent of the cocaine trafficked out of Peru, as Brazilian organized crime moves closer the source of the illegal drugs demanded by its booming domestic market, apparently securing supplies directly from the world's top cocaine producer. According to a confidential report from Peru's anti-drug authority (DIRANDRO) accessed by La Republica , a Brazilian organization known as the First Catarinense Group (Primeiro Grupo Catarinense - PGC) is the top client for several drug trafficking clans based in Peru's Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valleys (known as the VRAEM). The PGC is reportedly displacing Mexican groups like the Sinaloa Cartel, who were formerly responsible for much of the drugs moved out of the VRAEM and the Upper Huallaga Valley. One of the PGC's principal connections is reportedly Peruvian national Fortunato Lagos Lizarbe. His brother Luis was known as the ""King of the VRAEM"" as far back as 2007. The PGC moves product directly to Brazil using light aircraft - they allegedly control some 52 clandestine landing strips in the VRAEM and surrounding regions. Neither Peru nor Bolivia have effective control over their air space. They also rely on a combination of land and river routes leading to the Colombian and Brazilian border. The group has reportedly moved drugs through Peru's southern Cusco region into Bolivia as well, before exporting the cocaine and its derivatives to Brazil. The VRAEM is Peru's top coca growing region, producing around 200 tons of cocaine each year. A faction of the Shining Path guerrilla group dominates the region, overseeing coca purchases and protecting the drug shipments that move through their territory. According to La Republica, the PGC has been operating in the region since 2008 and was a key player in the re-establishment of the country's cocaine air bridge. Peruvian traffickers were once heavily dependent on moving cocaine to Colombia by air, but this route was largely blockaded by the authorities in the 1990s. In recent years, traffickers have turned to a new route that moves cocaine by air into Brazil, often via Bolivia or Paraguay. While Brazilian criminal networks are known to be top purchasers of Peruvian cocaine , this is a rare case of a Brazilian criminal group establishing themselves inside Peru, so as to be closer to the source of their illicit product. Powerful gangs including the First Capital Command ( PCC ) of Sao Paulo and the Red Command of Rio de Janeiro have mostly confined their presence to Paraguay and Bolivia , two transit nations for the cocaine trade. The cited Peruvian anti-drug agency report, of which no copy has yet appeared, highlights the growth of this relatively small Brazilian organization, and indicates that perhaps they sought to establish a foothold somewhere neither the PCC nor the Red Command have yet reached. As their name indicates, the First Catarinense Group's base of operations is Santa Cantarina, a state in southern Brazil. The organization is modeled on the PCC, but was created much more recently and is believed to have around 2,000 member, compared to the PCC's nearly 12,000. Last year, Southern Pulse reported the group was attempting to expand. The PGC's alleged leader, Osmar de Souza Junior, has twice escaped jail, once in 2009 and again in 2013 after being captured in Paraguay in 2012, where he was allegedly coordinating the shipment of some 300 kilos of cocaine per month to Brazil."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Central American Maras Expanding in Spain: Govt. Central American street gangs have established a presence in Spain and receive orders from their counterparts in Honduras and El Salvador, says the Spanish government, adding to fears these ""maras"" may become genuine transnational criminal actors. According to a government report obtained by Spanish newspaper La Razon , the Barrio 18 and MS13 street gangs -- known as ""maras"" -- have been present in Spain since 2005, and could now use the country's fragile economic situation to expand. The report refers to the cells established in Spain as ""pseudo-maras,"" and says they are made up of gang members who have fled the hardline ""iron fist"" government policies in El Salvador and Honduras, and are now attempting to expand territorially from their new location. Until now, the gangs have mostly been involved in isolated acts, included property crimes, knife violence, and inter-gang confrontations, says the report, but criminologist Ricardo Magaz said they are becoming ""more and more violent"" and have begun to profit from local drug distribution. Sociologist Laura Etcharren said the maras had also begun associating with drug traffickers moving product through Spain -- a jumping off point for cocaine distributed in Europe -- and that the groups represented a ""fusion between local and 'imported' crime."" Both the Barrio 18 and MS13 gangs have cells stretching from Central America to Canada. The United States recently sanctioned six MS13 leaders for charges including international drug trafficking, and last year designated the gang as a transnational criminal organization. However, as noted by InSight Crime , this label is questionable because much of the gang's activity continues to be localized. The different cells, or ""cliques"" control territory and charge extortion fees to local residents and businesses. While certain cliques are contracted to assist transnational drug traffickers, they generally have not in the past -- with certain exceptions -- run operations or been drug traffickers in their own right. Nonetheless, cross-border communication does occur between mara cliques, as evidenced by Honduran maras' attempts to replicate the El Salvador gang truce , and by numerous examples of maras in the United States coordinating with Central American counterparts. The establishment of Spanish mara cliques that maintain contact with the Central American gangs, along with reports they are involved with drug traffickers, could be signs that the maras are becoming genuinely transnational operations. However, for the moment it seems social and economic factors are driving migration, not a planned criminal strategy, and their criminal objectives remained dominated by the local."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Closing the Circle: Consolidating Zetas Territory in Guatemala. The Zetas are consolidating their territory in Guatemala, moving south from the Mexican border, and now only San Marcos province and the capital city remain for the circle to be complete. The Zetas have long been known as one of the most aggressively expansionist groups in Mexico. They have grown from their roots in the northeast to operate across the nation, and have also made inroads beyond Mexico's borders, especially in Guatemala. Indeed, as set out in a report from El Universal Domingo last month, the Zetas have turned Guatemala from a relative backwater for the drug trade into one of their primary areas of operation, and are expanding to control more and more of the country. The arrival of the Zetas sparked a series of fights for territory, and the gang has been behind some of the most notorious provocations since the end of Guatemala's civil war. In 2011, for instance, the Zetas were responsible for the massacre of dozens of campesinos who were working on the farm of a rival trafficker. The group has threatened to engage in a campaign of terror against civilians in Alta Verapaz, to protest the government's deployment of the army to the northern state in 2010. (They did not follow through.) The Zetas' tactics in Guatemala have mimicked those honed in Mexico, though they are even less restrained. The scale of the violence and the threat to the democratic institutions have made some analysts worry about the future of the nation, and have prompted a refreshingly open-minded examination of policy options from President Otto Perez. Indeed, Perez, a former general who promised to wield an iron fist against criminal groups, has turned into one of the region's most prominent advocates for drug legalization. The discussion about the Zetas' impact on Guatemala comes amid a period of great uncertainty for the gang in its home country. As InSight Crime has noted , reports have surfaced suggesting a struggle for power at the top of the organization, pitting longtime boss Heriberto Lazcano against his second-in-command, Miguel Angel Trevino. A prolonged fight could have a number of indirect but serious consequences for Guatemala; should the Zetas retrench and rebuild as a consequence of their internal strife, it might mean reducing their international operations, which could throw Guatemala's trafficking industry into flux. The following is InSight Crime's translation of sections from El Universo Domingo's report. In Las Mercedes alone there are at least three dark zones, border crossing points outside the control of the authorities. They are among 54 that the army estimates are scattered around San Marcos, the northwestern-most department of Guatemala, which borders on Chiapas, Mexico. The Sinaloa Cartel has traditionally been the Mexican tenant in this ""treasure,"" as it is described by Manuel Galeano, a former chief of civil intelligence who for years pursued drug traffickers in the country. During a journey of some two hours by car through San Marcos, the highway joins three of the cities most emblematic of drug trafficking in Guatemala. On the Pacific coast, according to military information, boats loaded with cocaine cross from Ocos to Salina Cruz, in the state of Oaxaca [Mexico]. From Tecun Uman, the second city, migrants and drug shipments share the routes toward the United States. In Malacatan, the third installment of this trilogy, mansions proliferate in a landscape that, if it weren't for them, could be anywhere. The transit of merchandise, people and drugs are the principal activities in these areas, which are the last bastion of a bloodless way of doing business in Guatemala, broken in 2007 by internal fighting among the local drug traffickers and by the arrival of the Zetas. The commander of the Zetas in Poptun is 24 years old and likes to demonstrate that he is one of the bosses in Peten (which borders Quintana Roo). Everyone knows him and fears him. Every day he goes to one of the stores on the main drag to drink beer and snort cocaine. It's his office. That's where he receives people. It's well known who he is, and he doesn't care. The only police car in the zone stays a few steps away, watching over him. The man who tells us this, who we will call Pedro, has worked for the past five years as an intelligence agent following the Zetas. He decided to meet with us in a hotel in Guatemala City. He talks like a hunter in pursuit of his prey. For him, the arrival of the Zetas is something personal. ""A Zeta is recognizable 100 kilometers away. You can smell it. You can feel it,"" he says between coffees, while telling us the story of the violence that has shaken Guatemala since the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel showed up on August 20, 2007. The Zetas have built a brand that in such a violent country -- the fifth in the world, at 45.2 homicides per 100,000 residents -- represents an achievement. On the day they arrived, the history of the country began to be written in bloody letters. They found their opportunity in the east of the country -- on the Mexican border, not far from Honduras -- where scarce police and military presence, jungle terrain, and difficult communication with the rest of the country by road made it the perfect territory for a type of drug trafficking never before seen here. Before then, Guatemala had not found itself a state under siege, nor witnessed decapitated men in public plazas and posters threatening to kill ""innocent people."" The traffickers, who had made names for themselves in mini drug cartels, were ""free agents"" who, although they worked primarily for the Sinaloa Cartel, were allowed to sell their merchandise to the highest bidder, according to sources we consulted. Always ""peacefully."" No fights for plazas, nor massacres of campesinos. San Marcos, the only place where the Zetas haven't managed to take over, is a remnant of that mode of understanding the business. Today, the normalcy continues. A few steps from the official border outpost of Carmen, dozens of people cross the river with all sorts of cargo on their shoulders, from gasoline to beer. The police watch them from the fences and do nothing. ""They take the difficult road so as to not pay taxes,"" says a currency-changer who gives us 300 quetzales for 500 pesos, enough to eat and get a hotel room that night. ""And how do [the police] know that they don't have drugs,"" we ask the man, who appears poor and returns to his home a half hour away, afraid of having his exchanged quetzales robbed. ""They don't know,"" he answers coolly, amid the bustle of people crossing from one country to another. While the Zetas spread themselves throughout Guatemala over the past five years, the alliances between the local cartels weakened and the DEA's work in the region led to the capture of their leaders: Juan Ortiz Chamale , Waldemar Lorenzana , Mario Ponce. All of the arrests took place in the previous two years. The last of these was Overdick himself, captured in early April this year. The pieces on the board switched around. Currently, the Zetas have complete control over the so-called ""Ingenieros route"" -- drugs arrive from Honduras and pass through Izabel department, through Raxruja (Alta Verapaz), cross the border with Mexico in Ingenieros (Quiche) and arrive in San Cristobal de las Casas [Mexico], after which the routes vary. The 33 percent reduction of Guatemala's army, a consequence of the Peace Agreements, resulted in this zone, previously protected by military outposts, remaining as unprotected as the southern coast, according to Manuel Galeano. In his opinion, the Zetas' territory in Guatemala is like a circle that they started to draw in Peten, later taking control of parts of Quiche, Alta Verapaz and Izabel, in the south of the country. After that, they struck out into Huehuetenango and are currently fighting for Zacapa, Escuintla and Chiquimula, where they operate in Puerto Quetzal -- one of the coastal regions with the greatest volume of drug trafficking. To close the circle, only San Marcos and the capital, Guatemala City, remain. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"US Agencies Botched Gun Running Investigations With Deadly Consequences: Watchdog. A new report from a US government watchdog has found that multiple agencies were at fault in a series of 2010 investigations of Texas arms traffickers, whose contraband was subsequently used in the 2011 murder of US immigration agent Jaime Zapata. The Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) published "" A Review of Investigations of the Osorio and Barba Firearms Trafficking Rings "" earlier this month. In the report, the authors seek to analyze whether any missteps by US agencies contributed to the trafficking of arms used in the attack on Zapata and his partner Victor Avila -- who was wounded, but survived -- in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi on February 15, 2011. A Mexican military raid weeks after the attack turned up six weapons used by the Zetas, the feared crime group determined to be responsible for the incident. Two of these firearms were traced to a pair of Texas criminal organizations, which purchased them legally in the United States and then smuggled them into Mexico. One weapon, purchased in October 2010, was trafficked by the Osorio Brothers organization, while the other, first acquired in August 2010, was tied back to the Manuel Gomez Barba organization. While these guns were not part of Operation Fast and Furious , in which Arizona-based agents of the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) failed to seize weapons following illegal transactions in 2009 and 2010, they were part of a broader debate about the suitability of the US approach to weapons trafficking. Both the Osorio and Barba networks had been under some degree of scrutiny by US agencies. The ATF had been aware of brothers Ranferi and Otilio Osorio's involvement in trafficking arms to Mexican criminal groups since early 2010, receiving evidence indicating as much from three different sources. First, an investigation into an Oklahoma narcotics detective revealed that the official supplied a group linked to the Osorios with a .50 caliber rifle, in addition to several other weapons. The detective and several associates were later arrested, and dozens of weapons were eventually seized. But despite evidence that suggested the Osorios were key figures in this organization, they were not contacted by the ATF until after Zapata's murder. Second, an investigation in Roswell, New Mexico, into suspicious purchases of AK-47s provided evidence that the targets of the investigation, the Gonzalez brothers, were working with the Osorios to supply weapons to the Zetas. And third, multiple internal sales and trace reports indicated that the Osorios were increasingly active in making suspicious straw purchases. Similarly, Manuel Gomez Barba had long been on the radar of another US federal law enforcement agency: the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). In a conversation with a DEA source, Barba bragged of buying 20 AK-47s for the Zetas in May 2010. The following month he was arrested on drug charges. In July 2010, after striking agreement to provide confidential information to the DEA, the US Attorney's Office handling the case withdrew a motion for Barba's detention, allowing him to leave custody on a $50,000 bond. Instead of working with DEA agents, Barba disappeared and continued trafficking firearms to Mexico, including one of the guns used in Zapata's killing. The OIG found that the agencies in question made mistakes that allowed Barba and the Osorios to continue trafficking weapons into 2011, which in turn led to those weapons winding up in the hands of the Zetas. The agency's report concluded that ATF repeatedly failed to act on probable cause and arrest the Osorios, and deferred to a DEA investigation in a misguided deference to bureaucratic prerogatives. For its part, the DEA failed to sufficiently share information about Gomez Barba's purchase of at least 10 AK-47s, while the US Attorney's Office should not have let him out on bond in July 2010, the report states. The OIG report provides a detailed look at the way arms traffickers feed Mexican criminal groups' appetite for weaponry. In Mexico, officials and media outlets often refer to ""ant traffic"": the practice of straw buyers purchasing small numbers of weapons legally, and smuggling operations slipping relatively small shipments across the border. Rather than buying in bulk, officials say criminal groups use this ant traffic method to meet their needs. That is precisely what we see in the OIG report. The buyers for the Osorio and Gomez Barba networks -- from the Oklahoma detective to the Osorio brothers themselves -- bought a small number of weapons at a time, from a diverse set of sources spread out across many hundreds of miles. When the weapons were consolidated for shipment, there were perhaps two dozen together at a time, not hundreds or thousands. For a number of reasons, this approach reduces the chance of major disruptions in illicit weapons flows. Law enforcement agencies, for instance, are less likely to pick up on an organization's pattern of illegal purchases. This is essentially what happened with the ATF's encounters with the Osorio brothers in 2010. Collectively, the agency had compiled several discreet pieces of evidence suggesting the organization was managing a large-scale arms trafficking network. But separately, the information seemed to represent an unrelated series of small-time illegal purchases. And no one put the pieces together until after the gun used in the Zapata murder was recovered in Mexico. Similarly, because the shipments are small, legal seizures can only upset a small part of the overall traffic. And because the smugglers' operations are similarly limited in size, even taking down an entire arms trafficking operation will have virtually no impact on the general availability of illicit arms in Mexico. In this sense, the arms industry is not unlike the drug trade, though arguably even more resistant to government countermeasures. While the OIG report focuses on narrow missteps by investigating agencies, it also provides ample evidence of shortcomings in US gun laws that feed the illegal market for weapons in Mexico. Most obviously, the report shows the ease with which traffickers can legally acquire powerful assault weapons, including mounted .50 caliber rifles, AR-15s, and AK-47s. Furthermore, even when a straw buyer is under surveillance and is making highly suspicious purchases, the bar for arrest and seizure is high. ATF agents following the Gonzalez brothers as they purchased eight AK-47s correctly assumed that these were destined for Mexican criminal groups, but the purchases themselves were legal. It also remains unclear if the agencies' mandate was leading them to pursue a coherent overriding strategy. As noted above, the ATF appears to have slowed its investigation of the Osorio gun trafficking network to comply with DEA requests stemming from the latter agency's own drug-related investigation. The OIG also notes that ""the ATF agents were more concerned with trying to identify firearms traffickers and not individual purchasers,"" an approach that affected whom they arrested and when. Such decisions are debatable, but it is not clear that they stem from a sober, calculated analysis. This is not a new critique; opponents of the Fast and Furious operation mentioned above have long focused on the lack of foresight behind the program. And although dismantling Fast and Furious may have been easy enough, finding effective strategies for targeting illicit arms flows, both in Mexico and in the United States, remains an elusive goal.

80% of Crimes Committed with Unregistered Guns in Honduras. According to a Congressional committee that handles public security issues, some 80.5 percent of all crimes in Honduras are committed with unregistered guns, as the country prepares to debate a new set of gun reform laws. A member of the committee told El Heraldo that only 23 percent of the weapons circulating in Honduras are registered. This is slightly lower than a previous estimate released by the Honduran government's human rights commission (CONADEH), which stated that just 30 percent of the country's approximate total of 850,000 firearms are officially registered. The numbers were released as Honduras' Congress is set to debate this week on stricter gun legislation. The proposed reforms would reduce the number of firearms which a citizen can purchase from five to just one. The reforms would also require citizens to apply (and pay) for two separate licenses -- one to purchase a firearm, and another one to carry it. The licenses would be valid for up to three years. The application fees could bring in some significant profits for the Honduran government, as El Heraldo notes. The proposed gun reform law would also mandate a special license in order to purchase and use explosive material. The law includes special exceptions that would make it easier for politicians, judges, prosecutors, and former government officials to apply for the new gun licenses. Passing a set of stricter gun laws in Honduras will arguably not be as challenging as actually enforcing it. As indicated by the numbers released by the Congressional committee on public security, the National Arms Register is already doing a poor job at regulation. Contributing to the amount of unregistered guns circulating through Honduras is the fact that corrupt elements of the police and military are believed to sell weapons to the black market. At other times, weapons in the hands of the government have simply disappeared. If Congress ultimately ends up approving stricter gun regulations, it will only be a symbolic step forward if the government does not address the other dynamics driving the illicit arms trade. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Guatemala to Assess Public Security Near Border After Week of Violence. The mayors of Huehuetenango, a western department in Guatemala known for high levels of drug-related activity, have called on the federal government to increase security measures after a spike in violence this week. According to Guatemala's Prensa Libre , the violence began with the kidnapping and subsequent murder of Emilia Quan, a sociologist who conducted research for an NGO in Todos Santos Cuchumatan. In response to the death, local townspeople organized a mob to capture the alleged perpetrators, identified as German Arturo Lopez Veliz and Evelio Aristides Rivas Martinez, who were then lynched. The day after, three men and one woman of Mexican origin were shot and killed near the village of La Reforma, in the border region with Mexico. Authorities report that gunmen armed with an AK-47 and an M-16 ambushed and killed the victims in their vehicle, subsequently lighting it on fire. The mayors will hold a meeting later this week with Interior Minister Carlos Menocal, and Defense Minister Abraham Valenzuela in order to address the worsening public security situation in the border region. Huehuetenango is a key transit point for drugs flowing through Guatemala, as InSight chronicled in a recent report. In November 2008, clashes between large trafficking organizations left dozens dead, and there are still frequent skirmishes. 	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Why Did US Blacklist Most LatAm Countries for Money Laundering?The United States has blacklisted n early all Latin American countries for money laundering in 2017. InSight Crime explores why this is the case, and discusses some of the achievements and failings of regional anti-money-laundering efforts over the past year. Of the 88 countries and territories included in the US State Department's annual list of ""Major Money Laundering Countries,"" 37 are located in Latin America -- 42 percent of the total. Compared to 2016, this adds 17 Latin American jurisdictions to the list, which is published in the United States' International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), a copy of which is embedded at the end of this article. Of the Caribbean jurisdictions included on the list, 11 of them (6 of which were new in 2016) couldn't be highlighted in the map below. Meanwhile, the number of countries and territories outside of Latin America included on the list went from 47 to 51. According to State Department officials consulted by InSight Crime, this does not correspond to a worsening in money laundering activities in the newly added territories -- which include Cuba, Ecuador, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago -- but rather to a changed methodology that focused more closely on the core concern of the INCSR reports: drug trafficking. This means that countries of primary concern are selected based on their importance in the international drug trade, a process that mainly considers whether or not they are included in the first volume of the INCSR , on ""Drug and Chemical Control"". This stands in contrast to the broader focus of past years, when jurisdictions were also selected for their role in laundering money from other serious crimes. State Department officials added that the decision to modify the report was made before the new US administration came into office. Even though the State Department's new classifications may not have been motivated by worse results, it nonetheless doubles down on its message to Latin America in particular: that countries deeply affected by the narcotics trade must focus their efforts not only on interdiction, but on where the drug money goes. While targeting drug networks' finances has always been crucial to law enforcement efforts, it has taken on renewed importance over the past year. Firstly, the INCSR's prioritization of Latin American territories is particularly conspicuous as it relates to the same year of the notorious "" Panama Papers "" -- a huge leak of confidential documents that exposed the elites behind countless shell companies. While such schemes do not necessarily imply illegal activity, their secrecy means they lends themselves for use by criminal organizations or corrupt individuals to hide ill-gotten gains. The scandal renewed international scrutiny on the dubious activities occurring in financial ""havens."" It ultimately prompted Panama to improve its transparency procedures, namely adhering to standards on tax information exchange. However, the INCSR notes that financial corporations continue to prioritize client secrecy over cooperation with authorities, who still lack the resources needed to effectively monitor possible illegal activity. Many Caribbean territories are considered ""havens"" for offshore banking, and their proximity to the United States heightens the risk of them being used to launder US currency. The 2017 INCSR's new list has put many of these islands under the spotlight -- including St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines -- which may add pressure to their governmentsto crack down on banking secrecy. In Colombia, criminal finances have also been a key focus: last year, the government demanded that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) rebels turn over all of their assets if they are to benefit from a peace deal signed in late 2016. But the guerrillas will probably not offer full transparency regarding their vast wealth, and the Attorney General's Office has taken extra measures to track and confiscate it. Among these is a new asset sharing agreement signed with the United States in November 2016, as the INCSR states. This should facilitate cooperation over Colombian assets laundered abroad; one comparable agreement between Colombia and Costa Rica led to what was reportedly the first ever seizure of FARC assets abroad in late 2016. But the State Department's new methodology has also led to the inclusion of some countries that do not generally appear to play a ""major"" role in moving illicit funds. Cuba, for example, was added to the 2017 list despite its country profile being rather favorable. ""The risk of money laundering is low"" in Cuba, the report reads, with tight government control making it ""an unattractive location for money laundering through financial institutions.""

"Kirchners Associate Accused of Money Laundering in Argentina. An Argentine contractor with close ties to former president Nestor Kirchner, has been accused of involvement in money laundering, capital flight and government corruption, raising questions about the activities of Kirchner and his wife and successor in the presidency, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. The allegations against Lazaro Baez emerged on April 14, when journalist Jorge Lanata showed hidden camera footage in which one of Baez's associates, Leonardo Farinas, admitted to involvement in a ""laundering network"" that handled the proceeds from government corruption, while working for Baez's contractor business, reported Clarin. According to Clarin , Baez's company, Aural Constructions, has received the majority of government contracts for public works in the province of Santa Cruz, where former president Nestor Kirchner served as governor from 1991 to 2003. The newspaper identified Baez as an ""intimate friend"" of Nestor Kirchner. Following the airing of the footage, a group of opposition lawmakers brought a complaint to public prosecutor Carlos Gonella urging him to investigate Baez's alleged involvement in money laundering, corruption, and capital flight. On April 17, the same group presented an additional complaint calling for Baez's assets to be frozen, reported Clarin. More details will likely soon emerge in this already complicated case, with anti-Kirchner media such as Clarin eager to investigate the story. The real question surrounds the degree of involvement of former president Nestor Kirchner, who died in 2010, and current President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. This case may revive the unresolved controversy over the source of the Kirchners' vast personal fortune and what happened to over $600 million in federal funding provided to Santa Cruz while Nestor Kircher was governor."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Corruption Fuels China-Brazil Human Trafficking. An investigation into the trafficking of Chinese workers to Brazil has uncovered evidence that Brazilian immigration authorities were involved, highlighting the key role that official corruption plays in enabling such trafficking networks. Judicial documents obtained by Estadao reportedly state that prosecutors believe corrupt immigration officials helped facilitate a human trafficking network between China and Brazil. The documents reportedly say that immigration officials at Rio de Janeiro's international airport charged approximately $12,000 for every person they allowed to go through immigration and pass into the hands of the traffickers. The airport officials covered their tracks by confiscating the migrants' passports, or removing the passport page with the entry stamp -- which could be used to identify the immigration offiicials on duty that day. Once they passed through immigration, the Chinese migrants worked in debt bondage in several bakeries, supposedly to pay off the costs of bringing them into the country. Other similar schemes have been exposed in recent months. Prosecutors have freed a number of workers from bakeries who had been lured to Brazil with promises of a $570 monthly salary and free room and board, reported Noticias UOL. Instead, when they arrived, the workers' passports were confiscated and they were told they had to work off their debt in what prosecutors described as ""slave-like conditions."" Brazil has become notorious for human trafficking and forced labor, with debt bondage schemes used to entrap foreign and national workers alike. According to recent estimates , as many as 40,000 people work in slave-like conditions in sectors such as factories, mining, agriculture and logging. Authorities have uncovered evidence of various countries providing this slave labor, ranging from neighbors such as Peru to more distant countries such as Bangladesh. It should come as no surprise that Chinese human trafficking networks are also present in Brazil, as past cases have shown they already operate in neighboring countries Uruguay and Argentina. As seen in Brazil, official corruption is a major enabler of human trafficking networks. Notably, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has identified corruption as one of the principal obstacles to effectively implementing anti-human trafficking policies."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"The Many Forms of Sex Trafficking in Central America. Sex trafficking is a common criminal activity in Central America and Mexico, but the business has different manifestations across the region depending on local dynamics. Mexico's El Universal has highlighted the work of anti-human trafficking activist Marisa Ugarte , who in 2008 began an investigation into sex trafficking along border cities in Baja California. According to her research, there are more than 5,000 human trafficking cells in the cities of Mexicali, Tecate and Tijuana in which women and children are sold for the purpose of sexual exploitation. For those skeptical of this figure, Ugarte shared an experience she had nearly four years ago, when a cab driver in Tijuana offered to sell her a 5-year-old boy. ""He said I could do whatever I wanted with him,"" Ugarte told El Universal. Human trafficking, and especially sex trafficking, in Mexico has attracted a significant amount of attention in recent years, as the security crackdown there has forced drug trafficking organizations to broaden their criminal portfolios. As a result, the country's cartels are becoming increasingly involved in human trafficking and sexual exploitation, which is made easier by a lack of strong penalties for these crimes. As congresswoman Rosi Orozco told the Washington Post recently, ""If narcotics traffickers are caught they go to high-security prisons, but with the trafficking of women, they have found absolute impunity."" But sex trafficking is not simply a problem in Mexico. As the U.S. State Department's 2011 Trafficking in Persons Report notes, the majority of human trafficking victims worldwide become products of commercial sexual exploitation, and the phenomenon is widespread throughout the western hemisphere. In fact, a 2010 report by Coalition Against Trafficking in Women and Girls found that Mexico ranked fifth in terms of the estimated number of trafficking victims in Latin America, putting the country below the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Brazil and Argentina. In Mexico, as in much of Central America, sex trafficking is closely linked not only with organized crime but also with the migrant smuggling trade. Because of the region's close proximity to the United States, the flow of migrants ensures a ready supply of new recruits. The economic and legal vulnerability of their situations makes them even easier targets. Sex trafficking is not just a purely economic phenomenon, however. Some victims are drawn into the trade due to more complex reasons, and then are psychologically conditioned into staying. As InSight Crime has documented, such is the case in Honduras, where young women are increasingly falling prey to false ""modeling agencies"" which serve as fronts for sex trafficking rings. Seeing an opportunity to fulfill aspirations of fame, young women contact the organizations, when they are often told to arrange an in-person ""audition,"" alone. From there, a cycle of psychological and physical abuse begins, and these women are often kidnapped or tricked into working in brothels in other Central American countries. Elsewhere in Central America, human trafficking is more closely associated with tourism, especially ""sex tourism,"" whereby individuals (generally wealthy North American or European men) travel to a country with the explicit purpose of purchasing sex, frequently with minors. This trend is particularly visible in Costa Rica, which is a major tourist destination. Although efforts have been made to clamp down on this sex trade, and break its ties with the conventional tourist industry, they have generally been unsuccessful. In 2004 the country made headlines for mandating that employees in the tourist industry be made to accept a new "" code of conduct "" which discourages them from assisting foreigners in finding sex. However, the strong economic incentives offered by the business made this relatively unsuccessful. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Powerful Mexico Crime Groups Grew by Extorting Avocado Trade: Report. A new report suggests that two organized crime groups in Mexico initially funded their criminal enterprises through extorting and kidnapping avocado farmers, shedding new light on how these now-powerful players got their start in the underworld. Throughout the 1990s, Mexico's Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (Cartel Jalico Nueva Generacion - CJNG) and the Cuinis criminal group pioneered the extortion and kidnapping of wealthy avocado farmers to fund their expansion, according to a report from the National Center for Planning, Analysis and Information for Combating Crime (Nacional de Planeacion, Analisis e Informacion para el Combate a la Delincuencia - Cenapi) of Mexico's Attorney General's Office, Reforma reported on October 29. The criminal groups reportedly had an ""intelligence system"" that targeted wealthy avocado farmers by using information obtained from records from Mexico's now-defunct Agriculture Secretariat (Secretaria de Agricultura). After being targeted, the farmers were then charged an extortion fee. If they refused to pay, the criminal groups proceeded to kidnap or kill the farmers and their families. This turned large-scale avocado producers into ""parallel financial sources"" that supplemented income from drug trafficking, according to the report. The report provides additional insight into the different criminal activities that CJNG and the Cuinis -- now two of Mexico's most powerful organized crime groups -- used to build their criminal operations. In subsequent years, other crime groups, like the Knights Templar and Familia Michoacana , have used extortion of the avocado industry as a source of financing. This pattern underscores how organized crime in Mexico has been fueled by US demand for products other than illicit drugs. And the size of the growing industry suggests it will continue to be a target for extortion by criminal elements. Avocado exports earned Mexico more than $1.5 billion in 2016. The embattled southwestern state of Michoacan, particularly the city of Tancitaro, is at the heart of this industry. The state is the world leader in avocado production and produced about 80 percent of the country's avocados in 2016. The United States accounted for nearly 80 percent of Mexico's avocado exports in 2016. Moreover, imports and per capita use of avocados in the United States has steadily increased since 2000. (Graphic courtesy of Newsweek ) Between 2009 and 2013, organized crime groups earned an estimated $770 million from Michoacan's avocado business, around $154 million annually. In response to the extortion, vigilante groups of avocado growers have taken up arms to attempt to fend off criminal groups trying to capitalize on the lucrative industry."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Acapulco Businesses Call for Peace Pact w/ Organized Crime. Business leaders in Acapulco are calling for a peace pact among citizens, the government and organized crime leaders, a desperate move that underscores the government's inability to reduce violence and extortion in Mexico's most dangerous city. During a recent press conference, Laura Caballero Rodriguez, president of the Association of Established Coastal Merchants (Asociacion de Comerciantes Establecidos de la Costera), requested a meeting with government officials and local citizens to discuss issues generated by criminal activity in Acapulco, Milenio reported. ""The call is also for our brothers in organized crime, whom we ask in a friendly way to give us a few days without violence while we hold a meeting with the state government and society in general"" to discuss a pacification proposal, said Rodriguez. Rodriguez also asked that the government cease taxing local business owners, who are unable to pay both taxes and extortion fees to criminals, El Universal reported. According to Rodriguez, 200 businesses in Acapulco's main tourist area alone have been forced to close their stores because of extortion demands or insecurity. The meeting is scheduled for April 13, with Rodriguez hoping 50 local criminal leaders will later accept the terms for a pact. If the meeting does not yield a quorum, Rodriguez said business leaders would conduct a public relations campaign to deter people from visiting Acapulco's touristy port area. Violence in Acapulco has surged in recent years. According to El Universal, the city has seen over 200 murders in 2016, and last year it was the most dangerous city in Mexico, with a homicide rate of 105 per 100,000 citizens. This violence is being driven by competing criminal groups looking to control Acapulco, which is situated in the tumultuous state of Guerrero -- an important region for drug production and transit. The city, with its port and home to many businesses catering to the tourist industry, offers a tempting target for smugglers and extortionists. Indeed, local businesses have previously complained of paying extortion fees to multiple criminal groups. Now, it appears Acapulco business leaders are taking matters into their own hands. Whether or not their initiative proves successful, Rodriguez's call for a community meeting, and threats to dissuade tourists from visiting Acapulco, places pressure on the local and state governments to reduce insecurity and protect citizens. Moreover, while the government is unlikely to stop taxing local businesses victimized by extortion, the suggestion brings attention to the problem, embarrassing Acapulco officials and perhaps compelling them to take action to tackle the city's parallel criminal structures."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Does Maracaibo Gang Mark Evolution in Venezuela Organized Crime?Authorities in Venezuela have killed four members of a criminal group that allegedly commands 30 smaller groups, suggesting a level of sophistication and organization that could mean Venezuelan criminals are moving closer to making the leap into transnational organized crime. The four members of a group known as Tren del Norte were killed in a shootout with security forces on May 6, reported Venezuelan newspaper Panorama. A spokesman for national police agency CICPC said the group was responsible for extortion, robbery, car theft, hired assassinations, drug trafficking, burglary and bank robbery in the northern and western sections of Maracaibo, Venezuela's second largest city. Tren del Norte has been linked to numerous homicides, including the recent death of a woman who was attending a child's birthday party when members of the group broke into the party venue and opened fire. The organization and range of activities of Tren del Norte echoes that of an "" oficina de cobro "" -- a Colombian criminal structure that provides services such as assassinations and debt collecting for larger organizations, but also engages in its own activities, such as micro-trafficking and extortion. As appears to be the case with Tren del Norte, these Colombian organizations also use the services of affiliated gangs. In addition to its size and level of organization, Tren del Norte has apparently recruited National Guard members and uses high-caliber weapons, two more indications of its sophistication. Venezuela is already a hub for transnational crime as it is a key transit country for Colombian drug shipments headed to the United States and Europe. This is especially true in the Colombian border region, where Maracaibo is located, where drugs and contraband items like fuel are smuggled across the land border, and drug flights are dispatched. However, aside from the country's military, the trade is dominated by foreign groups. Several Colombian organizations , including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and BACRIM (for the Spanish ""bandas criminales"" -- criminal bands) maintain a presence in the region, while Mexico's Zetas have also been reported to operate in the region. The situation is exacerbated by widespread protests and civil unrest in Venezuela throughout 2014, which have kept the police preoccupied with political problems. The chaos created by these protests, coupled with a weak administration, provides fertile ground for the development of criminal groups."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Mexico Self-Defense Groups Coach Businesses On Counter-Extortion. Businesses associations in Guerrero will reportedly meet with citizen self-defense groups in order to discuss how to best combat extortion, a marked difference from the aggressive approach taken against vigilante organizations in other parts of Mexico. Fernando Melendez Cortes, president of business association COPARMEX in Chilpancingo municipality, said there had been a rise in extortions, with 350 businesses closing and 800 jobs lost on average each month, reported La Jornada Guerrero and El Universal. Vigilante groups have had some success lowering crime rates in Guerrero's Costa Chica and Montana regions, claimed El Universal. In the next few days COPARMEX will hold various meetings with self-defense group leaders to discuss different security methods to counter extortion threats and kidnapping, although no details were given as to what those methods might be. Leader of vigilante coalition Union of Peoples and Organizations in the State of Guerrero (UPOEG), Bruno Placido Valerio, told La Jornada that the groups would analyze whether a community police force could be established. The two organizations are also sending a joint letter to the state and federal government demanding more funds to combat crime. Citizens across Mexico have responded to the government's failure to effectively fight crime by creating their own self-defense groups, with mixed results and a mixed response from authorities. The meetings between UPOEG and COPARMEX are one example of the cooperation between self-defense groups and wider society in Guerrero, where the state government has welcomed the movement, going so far as legalizing the self-defense forces and setting them official responsibilities. However, in Michoacan state, where the vigilante groups also have a strong presence, government officials have been fighting them off, with Governor Jesus Reyna Garcia recently stating that the vigilante groups in the state were ""gradually fading away"" as a result of a mass military deployment. The vigilantes in Michoacan have been fighting both the Knights Templar drug cartel and state authorities , who they accuse of corruption."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Rio Authorities Take Down Police Extortion Gang. Authorities in Rio de Janeiro dismantled an extortion ring comprised of serving and former police officers, pointing to the level of criminality within the city's police force. On the morning of December 18, Brazilian authorities arrested eight people accused of being part of an extortion ring in Rio de Janeiro. Five of these were active police officers in the city while the remaining three people were a former fireman, an ex-agent from the military police and a former member of the civil police, reported Univision. According to Jornal do Brasil , investigators found that the gang would seize cargo coming into Rio and then demand extortion payments for returning it. They reportedly used a lorry parked at a station for the police's Robbery and Theft Unit (DRFC) to store the ""seized"" goods. During the operation to dismantle the gang, authorities found 140,000 reals (over $65,000) worth of goods in the lorry. The officials would allegedly also demand payments in exchange for not carrying out raids on warehouses storing contraband, and not inspecting incoming cargo. Rio's Civil Police Chief Marica Pita stated, ""We will not stop bad cops, but we will certainly control them."" This news comes just two weeks after 59 Rio police officers were detained on suspicion of accepting bribes from the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) drug gang in exchange for allowing the group to continue their operations without police interference. The police also reportedly extorted gang members by kidnapping them or their families. The series of arrests are a promising sign that Rio's authorities are seeing success in tackling police corruption. However, the fact that in both cases police were actively running their own extortion rings is a worrying sign, pointing to a far deeper level of criminality within the force than simply accepting a bribe to look the other way. Scandals such as these are causing significant damage to the public's trust in the police nationwide. A recent survey found that 63 percent of respondents in Brazil were unsatisfied with police performance, with 75 percent naming the army as the most trusted institution in the country."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
Guatemala Sees 3 Bus Drivers Murdered in Single Day. Three bus drivers were shot to death in a single day in Guatemala, illustrating the threat that the country's transport workers are under from criminal groups who demand extortion payments. The first victim, Mario Augusto Salazar, was killed by three gunmen who were traveling as passengers in a bus he was driving between between two towns in southwestern Guatemala. Authorities are investigating whether he was killed for failing to pay extortion fees, reported La Prensa Libre. The other two victims, drivers Dimas Mendez Rodas and Jose Angel Ramos Jimenez, were murdered by gunmen in the province of Jutiapa and in Guatemala City, respectively. Extortion of bus drivers by gangs and violent retribution for those who fail to pay are common in many parts of Latin America. In Medellin, six bus drivers have been killed this year, as the fragmentation of the city's criminal groups means that transport workers are being pressured to make payments to multiple gangs on their routes through the city. In Guatemala, extortion of bus drivers has become so endemic and violent that a 2011 InSight Crime investigation concluded that driving a bus in that country may be one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. According to Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, 1,368 people were murdered on public transport in the country between 2005 and 2011, 780 of whom were drivers. Guatemala City is in the process of replacing its old buses with a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, whose vehicles are more secure and where drivers do not handle cash, in order to cut down on extortion of drivers and reduce violence. According to some sources , as of 2011 there had been no murders, armed robberies, or other violent incidents reported on the system since it opened in 2007, although this had not been confirmed by the authorities. However, there has been opposition from some bus drivers. Earlier this week, the Extraurban Transport Union (Gretexpa) voted to oppose a government proposal to implement a prepaid system on all their buses, on the grounds that it would bring in more stringent regulations in terms of licensing, reported La Prensa Libre .	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Immigration Crackdowns Drive Cuban-on-Cuban Crime in South Mexico. Cubans now top the list of foreign criminals in the southern Mexican state of Quintana Roo, with the region's shifting migration landscape having serious impacts on organized crime in the country. Quintana Roo's security secretary, Alberto Capello Ibarra, stressed that while most criminal activity in the state was at the hands of major Mexican gangs, foreign groups had been increasingly involved in human trafficking, money laundering and drug dealing. The tourist hubs of Cancun and Playa del Carmen are home to around 10 foreign criminal groups, especially Cubans, although Romanians and Israelis are present as well, Capello Ibarra stated at a security conference. ""The criminal groups made up of Cubans often single out their own countrymen as targets in frauds, kidnappings, and robberies,"" he was quoted as saying by Cubita Now. ""The cases of Cubans kidnapping other Cubans to demand ransoms from their relatives in the United States are ever more common."" This phenomenon is not restricted to Quintana Roo. Several Mexican states have seen a wave of crimes committed by Cubans against their own compatriots in recent months. In August 2018, 39 Cuban migrants were rescued from a house in Cancun, where they had been held captive by a group of four Cubans and one Mexican. A similar case in January 2019 saw eight Cubans rescued from a Cuban kidnapping gang in Merida, Yucatan, just north of Quintana Roo. The proliferation of Cubans as both perpetrators and victims of organized crime in Quintana Roo directly reflects how changes in US migration policy have left migrants stranded and increasingly vulnerable to gang exploitation. Cuban migration through Mexico has surged in recent years , following President Obama's repeal of the so-called "" Wet Foot, Dry Foot "" policy in 2017. Under this policy, Cubans had been guaranteed political asylum in the US. Now, they are resorting to clandestine overland routes. Although most investigations into how migrants are affected by crime in Mexico have focused on Central Americans , recent reports suggest that Cuban migrants are valued targets for gangs, due to the higher likelihood that they will have relatives in the US prepared to make protection payments. For the unscrupulous or desperate among their compatriots, this can provide an easy route into crime. Capello Ibarra highlighted that a common criminal modality in Quintana Roo is for Cubans to pass information on their fellow nationals to Mexican kidnappers, in exchange for a share of the ransom. The number of Cuban migrants falling victim to crime in Mexico is only likely to spiral further. In July 2019, Mexico's National Migration Institute (Instituto Nacional de Migracion - INM) reported a staggering thirty-fold increase in Cuban arrivals compared to the previous year. Cuba's proximity to the coast of Quintana Roo makes this state a key entry point. Furthermore, Trump's ""Remain in Mexico"" policy now obliges migrants to wait in Mexico while their claims are processed. This leaves many stuck in migration limbo, in a country racked by criminal violence, where they are vulnerable to both gang predation and cooptation."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Argentina Police Possibly Involved in Upsurge of Kidnapping. Kidnappings rose by 50 percent in Argentina's Buenos Aires province between 2013 and 2014, a trend that appears to be fueled in part by the participation of corrupt active and former police officers. A total of 78 kidnappings were reported in Buenos Aires province in 2014, compared to 52 the year before, according to statistics from the provincial Attorney General's Office accessed by Clarin. Over the past two months, eight more kidnappings have been reported, at least three of which investigators believe were carried out by a sophisticated criminal group allegedly made up of current and former police officers. Meanwhile, six former federal police officers are currently on trial for allegedly running an extortion network in neighboring Cordoba province. The group -- which called itself ""The Millionaire Club"" -- allegedly threatened business owners with kidnappings and arbitrary detentions if they refused to pay monthly quotas. Both the former commissioner of the federal police delegation in Cordoba and his third in command are among the accused. The kidnapping figures provide some evidence of what has long appeared to be a growing problem in Argentina. However, these numbers likely fail to illustrate the full scope of the problem, as many kidnapping cases go unreported or are classified as another type of crime, according to Clarin. For example, kidnappings in Buenos Aires often begin as car robberies and morph into kidnappings if the perpetrators perceive the victim as being wealthy. These types of ""express"" kidnappings are therefore frequently reported by police as ""robberies followed by illegal deprivation of liberty"". The alleged participation of police in kidnappings further complicates this situation, increasing the risk of impunity, as police can use their law enforcement contacts to ensure crimes are not investigated or prosecuted. Criminals with a police background also have the ability to employ sophisticated tactics that decrease the probability of detection, as seen by a recent case in which a businessman was allegedly kidnapped by current and former police who forced him to remain barefoot in order to keep traces of their hideouts from ending up on his shoes. Other examples of alleged police participation in Argentine organized crime abound. A journalistic investigation conducted in 2014 revealed the alleged involvement of Buenos Aires police in burglaries and other criminal activities, while widespread corruption has forced provincial authorities to purge thousands of police officers in recent years. In addition, a large number of the individuals prosecuted for belonging to a drug trafficking organization known as Los Monos -- one of Argentina's most significant homegrown groups -- were police and members of other security forces. Security force involvement in kidnappings has been seen elsewhere in the region. In Colombia, a criminal network that sold hostages to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) included several current and former police officers. Similarly, a 2011 InSight Crime investigation in Venezuela found that up to 70 percent of kidnappings in Caracas were carried out by members of the now disbanded metropolitan police force."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Security in a Post-Chavez Venezuela. The announcement that Venezuela's president is suffering from cancer raises the question of what lies ahead for the country, which under Chavez's leadership has been increasingly beset by organized crime. President Hugo Chavez's sudden return to his country after several weeks in Cuba has raised the spirits of his supporters. But with the news that the leader is seriously ill, even his most devoted fans are looking forwards to what could happen with Chavez off the political scene, which suddenly seems a real possibility. Crime under Chavez has grown exponentially, with Venezuela now the principal transit nation for Colombian cocaine heading for Europe. The official murder rate stands at 47 per 100,000 people , making Venezuela one of the most dangerous places in the world, well above its war-wracked neighbor Colombia. Kidnapping has soared, with some estimating that abductions rose 60 percent in 2010, up to a total of 1,179 last year. These high rates of violence are linked to the growth of organized crime, which is firmly rooted in the country's institutions. A dramatic illustration of the level of this penetration of organized crime was given by the recent disturbances in the Rodeo II prison , close to Caracas. Heavily armed prisoners have been holding off the security forces since June 18 , under the command of criminal bosses who reportedly control everything that goes on inside the prison. Two of the institution's governors have been arrested on suspicion of allowing the trafficking of arms into the institution. The police fare little better than the penal system. In 2009, the government itself said that the police were behind some 20 percent of all crime in Venezuela , including murder and kidnapping. The military has long faced charges that many of its elements are connected to organized criminal groups, and even run drug trafficking operations themselves. Drug trafficker Walid Makled, recently extradited to Venezuela by Colombia, claims to have paid off members of the Venezuelan Congress, high ranking military commanders, and to have given money to Chavez's party. He even claimed that government forces had guarded drug facilities for him. The chance of any major changes in the near future are small. No figure from the Chavez-dominated ruling PSUV party stands out as having the backing, or independence, to take over from the charismatic leader. Vice President Elias Jaua did not take over in his absence, as the constitution sets out. Chavez has not groomed anyone for the succession, though one possible contender could be his brother Adan Chavez, who governs the state of Barinas. Rule by this second Chavez is unlikely to herald a move towards strengthening the rule of law; in the midst of concerns about the president's health, Adan told supporters that they should not rule out armed struggle as a means to retain power. Meanwhile the rather weak opposition has not produced any single candidate who stands out as a powerful successor. A report by the Associated Press says that the opposition is only held together by animosity towards Chavez, and that his removal could cause its fragile coalition to fragment, as its different elements could be encouraged to strike out on their own. It's unclear how much even the most reform-minded successor could change things. The rot in Venezuela's institutions goes deep, and much corruption and abuse existed before Chavez even came to power. As for the economy, and the poverty rates that also contribute to the power of organized criminal groups, there are deeper structural issues that will prevent any swift turnaround. As a recent Reuters report pointed out , the predominance of oil in Venezuela encourages state control of the economy, and means that governments with poor economic policies can be propped up by high oil prices. However, it is clear that there are many Venezuelans who want change. A poll by Datanalisis , carried out in May 2011, found that Chavez's popularity had fallen to 47 percent, down from 71 percent in 2006. The head of the polling firm said that this drop was due to the president's ""inability to resolve the everyday problems of Venezuelans,"" such as inflation, unemployment, and insecurity. The last of these may turn out to be a crucial factor in draining support away from the Bolivarian revolution, whether or not the president makes a full recovery from his illness. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Ungoverned Spaces in the Americas, Part II. In the second part of a series on ungoverned spaces in Central and Latin America, Southern Pulse surveys cities in the region where the security forces have been unable to establish full control, allowing criminal gangs to flourish. A massacre at a bar leaving 20 dead would be news anywhere in Mexico. The fact that it happened in downtown Monterrey made it an instant crisis for the government. One of Mexico's most important cities economically, sections of Monterrey have fallen outside of government control. As major criminal organizations fight over the city, the question of whether the government actually has control over the urban area is at stake. Monterrey's decline since March 2010 may be the most dramatic example of a trend in Latin America of ungoverned spaces in urban areas. Slums and other neighborhoods are an urban problem throughout the world, but the idea that governments lack control of areas with significant population densities has implications for security, politics and the social contract in general. Transnational criminal organizations have moved into a variety of these spaces, increasing their influence and finding new profit models. To the north of Monterrey, Ciudad Juarez, Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo exemplify the fears of those in Monterrey. The border cities have had a near complete breakdown of governing in some aspects; in other aspects, they remain normal functioning cities flushed with border zone economies. Ciudad Juarez is perhaps the most infamous, with one of the highest murder rates in the world and Mexican troops patrolling the streets, but is perhaps not the worst of the group. Local government and police in Nuevo Laredo and Reynosa are almost completely under the control of criminal organizations. Mexico will never be a ""failed state"" in the sense of other ungoverned countries of the world, but it increasingly faces the question of failed cities. Mexico's urban problem is in some ways more resolvable than the situation presented by major cities of Central America. Every capital in Central America has barrios with skyrocketing levels of crime. Local drug trafficking and drug consumption, driven by the tendency for transnational criminal organizations to pay street gangs with cocaine, not cash, adds to the finances of the gangs and social order breakdown. Central America Each of the capitals in Central America's Northern Triangle -- San Salvador, Tegucigalpa, Guatemala City -- has neighborhoods that are almost completely controlled by youth gangs, organized crime or a combination of the two. Additionally, in Honduras, the city of San Pedro Sula and the port of La Ceiba have significant urban slums that are outside of government control and fit a similar pattern. In Guatemala, the city of Coban is an exemplary case of how citizen and state operate in a city under criminal control. Many would argue that the Salvadoran city of Santa Ana is only a few years from becoming the next San Pedro Sula or Coban. One feature these cities and their neighborhoods share in common is an increase in illegal drug consumption and sales. The Central American corridor is no longer just a transit point for illegal drugs moving from South America to the US. There is an increase in the use of marijuana, cocaine and meth, as well as certain legal drugs and the use of paint and other chemicals to fight hunger, pass the time, or just escape a bleak reality. Criminal organizations control the distribution of many of these drugs. In some cases, the local gangs in urban areas are making higher profits from local drug distribution than the major trafficking of cocaine to the north. Drug consumption, a social health problem exacerbated by the nature of paying criminal contractors with cocaine, is the underlying reason why Brazil was for many years second only to the United States for cocaine use. It's the same reason why Mexico has today surpassed Brazil as the world's number two. While Central Ameria's Northern Triangle receives more attention, it's worth considering that Managua, San Jose and Panama City all have rougher sections of town where most people won't enter and where local police have told Southern Pulse investigators that they are not in complete control. The murder and crime rates may not be as high in these neighborhoods as in their counterparts to the north, but the lack of security and government control has citizens in all three capitals nervous. The fall from a once secure environment to the present condition has been more dramatic than any observers expected, especially in Costa Rica. Medellin Not too long ago, any discussion of ungoverned spaces in the cities of the Americas would have started with Medellin. The city was notorious for its drug cartel, paramilitaries and local street gangs who controlled nearly every aspect of life in the city. In the mid-2000's, the city went through a revival. Violence decreased dramatically, police established stations in neighborhoods where they had never had a presence, and foreign investment increased. The reasons behind the crime decline is subject to intense debate. The government's story is that Medellin finally got its act together, took on the violent groups, pushed them out, and brought in governance. Many critics, however, say the government struck an unwritten deal with a local paramilitary commander, giving his organization control in exchange for peace. Today, Medellin's security is again starting to devolve. What was once hailed as a major success in restoring government control to an urban ungoverned space may show that short term victories don't necessarily equal long term success. Medellin is still far better than it was in the 1980's and 90's, but various criminal groups are fighting for control. From 2008 to 2009, the city's murder rate nearly doubled. Venezuela Perhaps one of the least governed capitals in the Americas is ironically in a country where the leader portrays himself as a modern-day caudillo rolling over government institutions and leading a revolution. While critics complain that the government is overreaching, the fact is that the police and military cannot even enter several barrios just a few miles from the presidential palace. Caracas under Hugo Chavez has become one of the most violent cities on earth, with murder rates rivaling Ciudad Juarez or San Pedro Sula for the top spot on that notorious list. Kidnapping is endemic and muggings are so common in a number of neighborhoods that every family surveyed knows someone who has been a victim. At one point in 2010, the government instituted rolling blackouts in Caracas to manage their electricity problems, and the thieves instituted an organized rolling wave of robberies to use the lack of lighting and alarms to steal. It was one of the reasons the government relented so quickly to not rationing electricity in the capital. Exacerbating this problem is the fact the Caracas police force is an institution of corruption. Current and retired police officials have been linked to a significant number of homicides, kidnappings and other crimes, and the numbers of people executed while ""resisting arrest"" has increased over the past decade. Brazil To the south, Brazil doesn't just face ungoverned territory in the vast tracks of the Amazon and the ""wild west"" of the tri-border region. Several dozen favelas sit inside the city limits of Rio and Sao Paulo, which are the two cities that receive the most attention, while festering pools of insecurity grow in Salvador, Recife, and other northern cities. Local militia leaders, who have spread their control across several favelas in Rio de Janeiro, control many of the neighborhood utility services. Connections to electricity, water or cable came with a ""protection tax."" Even sewage systems in some neighborhoods were unofficially ""privatized"" by the local warlord entrepreneur who filled in where the government services lacked. Extortion has never been more thorough. In the run-up to Brazil's World Cup and Olympics, the country's military and police have been retaking cities, favela by favela, most focused on Rio de Janeiro. The operations, which have been successful in some key urban centers but may have brought unintended consequences in others, have opened a window into just how ungoverned these favelas were. Brazil's security forces are now trying to create the model of retaking lost urban areas, bringing a ""whole government"" approach focused on providing all services as soon as possible after police have cleared a neighborhood of gang leaders. In all of the cases above, the problem isn't simply government neglect or incapacity. Transnational crime actively works to undermine government initiatives and clear out government presence in urban areas. Criminal organizations have implemented a type of counter-counter-insurgency, in which their own ""clear, hold and build"" strategy works to dislodge the state, hold ground and then build up their own resilient parallel parallel institutions. This doesn't indicate that the effort to provide governance is hopeless. Indeed, while Colombia and Brazil have seen setbacks, their success is measurable and has improved the lives of people living in the areas where governance has been restored. Citizens want governance, and while they will take gang and criminal leadership over anarchy, most people recognize it is not an ideal solution and a worse alternative to an effective municipal and nation-state government presence. Unfortunately, many municipal, state, and federal governments in Latin America have a hard time discerning between what's effective and what's simply ""good enough"" - a status quo easily attacked and defeated by criminal groups.

"Rios Police Face Reality Check in Un-Pacified Favela. Brazil's elite military police are trying to build ties with communities and undo the harm done by officers who allegedly abused residents in Complexo da Mare, a favela which has not yet come under police control, reports blogger Julia Michaels. Since the 2008 start of Rio's new public safety policy, BOPE, the military police elite squad, has met with community members, but never like this. First of all, the cops weren't even invited. ""When we saw you coming in, the first thing we thought was, 'They're going to prevent us from meeting',"" said Rubens Casara, a judge active on human rights issues. ""The second was, 'They're going to try to keep people from making accusations about police behavior',"" he told three elite squad members who came, it turned out, to actually listen and respond to residents. Second, the reason everybody was crammed into a large classroom at the Observatorio de Favelas NGO in the Nova Holanda section of the Mare complex of favelas in Rio's North Zone was Rio's first cable-stayed bridge -- not the sort of thing that normally figures into public safety strategies. Brazil, land of contrasts Set to open to vehicle traffic next month, the ultra-modern $176 million equivalent bridge is taking shape by way of the machinery and men of the Queiroz Galvao construction company. It will connect the ""Red Line"" highway to UFRJ, the federal university campus where two other engineering feats are coming to life: the $500 million GE research and development center , and a $300 million equivalent research center where the university and several other companies will develop pre-salt oil exploration technology. Third, the closest ""community"", as the politically correct like to call favelas, the Complexo da Mare, isn't pacified. So not pacified is it that on October 10, an unidentified number of armed drug traffickers reportedly showed up at the construction site, demanding two million reais ($1.2 million, equivalent) in exchange for a peaceful construction environment. So what did the elite squad do, to make sure the bridge will be finished on time? They dropped pamphlets out of a helicopter, asking Mare residents for their help, and sent 120 men into the area to find the extortionists. Except that the pamphlets (leftovers from another favela) erroneously said the area was being pacified, the extortionist chase wasn't mentioned until today, and, residents say, the men have been searching homes without knocking, shooting their weapons without regard for passersby, and generally terrorizing people. ""Their search warrants are their uniforms,"" said one resident. ""They say, 'What are you looking at?' and don't wear nametags,"" as required. ""There are from 400 to 500 drug traffickers here,"" said Jailson de Souza, founder of the Observatorio, which has a strong focus on human rights. ""And anywhere from 140,000 to 150,000 people live here, altogether. But the soldiers seem to think of all this as enemy territory"". Blonde-ponytailed Captain Marlisa (no last name given, per Brazilian habit) said she'd give out her contact information, so residents can report police misdeeds. ""I need this kind of feedback,"" she said. Officers are supposed to wear nametags, and may only enter private property with a search warrant, or when catching a criminal in the act. Can another sort of bridge be built? All three BOPE officers appeared to sincerely want to improve communication and to work together with the community. In favelas with new police pacification units -- from all accounts the only places where the elite squad has sat down to exchange ideas with locals -- this posture has worked fairly well. But Complexo da Mare is another world, without peace, a true test of police training and performance. Lieutenant Alexandra Vicente, a corps psychologist, said investigations would be carried out and that soldiers found to have abused their authority could be fired in as little time as a month. De Souza recognized that the state public safety policy represents a change of paradigm, with the corps being trained in community policing, the retaking of territories until now dominated by criminals, and the establishment so far of 17 police pacification units. ""But what's going on here is the old paradigm,"" he concluded. Health workers present at the meeting said the stress on the local population has brought on increases in hypertension, diabetes and, in children, psychosomatic fevers. A teacher complained of a machine-gunned wall. Charles Guimaraes, president of the Baixa do Sapateiro neighborhood association, said that the police didn't stop to help a woman he claims they shot. The bridge extortion attempt brings up questions about the geography of the huge Complex and just which one of three drug gangs might be responsible. The area where BOPE has been active for the last 10 days isn't contiguous to the building site. But the police do have intelligence and a strategy, Lt. Vicente assured RioRealblog. ""We're not just saying, oh, let's go here today,"" she added. Intelligence isn't likely to be coming from residents, both wary and weary of the way they're being treated. They demanded, above all, that actual police behavior match the prescribed one. Police are known to fabricate in flagrante delicto crime scenes by providing drugs. ""What am I going to say [when a cop conducts a search without a warrant, or hits a resident, for example], 'I'm going to tell Captain Marlisa on you'?"" asked a meeting participant. After the meeting, 30 NGOs, neighborhood associations, community projects, municipal health clinics and a city school released a document demanding an immediate meeting with the State Public Safety Secretariat, with the BOPE command, and the local battalion commander; a communique from BOPE to residents explaining the current incursion and describing legally correct police behavior; the investigation of all human rights violations reported to BOPE; and the immediate suspension of the current operation until the above requests are fulfilled.

"Cattle Rustling A Growing Concern in Nicaragua. Nicaragua's government is facing growing calls to combat illegal livestock trafficking, an activity that frequently goes hand in hand with other types of organized crime in the region. On June 17, several Nicaraguan business associations released a joint document calling for the government to investigate contraband cattle trafficking in ""blind spots"" along the country's borders with Honduras and Costa Rica, reported ACAN-EFE. Nicaragua's chamber of beef exports, known as CANICARNE, has said cattle rustling is costing the state $276 million in lost tax revenue, according to La Prensa (see La Prensa's graphic on the costs of cattle rustling below). Some 300,000 heads of cattle had been illegally removed from Nicaragua between 2013 to 2014, according to documents that CANICARNE reportedly sent to the government. Meanwhile, CANICARNE president Raul Barrios has said that due to cattle rustling, Nicaragua's slaughterhouses are now processing 50 percent fewer cattle. The chamber's vice president has demanded a meeting with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega to discuss the issue, saying the government's response to the problem has been inadequate. According to a 2011 census, there are 4.12 million heads of cattle in Nicaragua. Cattle rustling is an ongoing problem in Nicaragua and one that merits more attention, especially given that elsewhere in the region, traffickers have used the cattle trade as a way to launder drug money -- sometimes even using the animals to smuggle drugs. Indeed, some Central American drug transport groups -- including the Leones in Guatemala; and the Cachiros and Valle Valle clan in Honduras -- started out as small-time cattle rustlers, stealing and reselling cattle in border regions. They then re-adapted these smuggling routes and contacts for the drug trade. Cattle rustling in itself is partly a response to market forces, with smugglers seeking out higher prices for the animals in neighboring countries. Nicaraguan police have said they've identified rustlers from Mexico and El Salvador."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Colombian Drug Gang the Rastrojos Face US Sanctions. The US government has placed sanctions on Colombian drug gang the Rastrojos, including one of its top leaders who was captured last year, suggesting the United States is preparing to target the weakened group's financial assets. The US Treasury Department designated Diego Perez Henao, alias ""Diego Rastrojo,"" along with his Rastrojos organization, as ""Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers"" under the terms of the Kingpin Act. As a result, US citizens are banned from conducting business with its members, and any of the group's assets under US jurisdiction will be frozen. The Rastrojos, which emerged from the ranks of the now defunct Norte del Valle cartel, have been among the main players in the Colombian underworld for several years. Until his capture in Venezuela last year , Diego Rastrojo was the group's military chief. According to the Treasury's press release: Diego Rastrojo was ""the main source of supply for numerous multi-ton loads of cocaine smuggled into the US, owning and coordinating airborne and maritime cocaine shipments destined for the US through Venezuela to Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico."" The Rastrojos' two other main leaders, Javier Antonio Calle Serna, alias ""Comba,"" and his brother Luis Enrique Calle Serna, both surrendered to US authorities last year. The Rastrojos emerged as an independent drug trafficking group during the protracted break-up of the Norte del Valle Cartel in the period 2007-2009, and became one of Colombia's most powerful drug trafficking organizations. In some ways it is surprising the Treasury is only acting now, when the group is in disarray, lacking centralized leadership and fending off attacks from rivals the Urabenos. However, it is possible the Treasury designation is based on information offered by the Calle Serna brothers since their surrender. If so, this could be a sign the Rastrojos will soon face a legal attack on its remaining leadership figures and financial assets, an assault that the already weakened and fracturing group is ill-equipped to withstand."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Drug Dealers Operate Freely at Mexicos Largest University: Video. A new video provides an inside look at the operations of small-scale drug trafficking groups on the campus of Mexico's biggest university, suggesting that the general lack of control security forces have over criminal groups has permeated the country's top academic institution. The video , filmed by Mexican journalist Humberto Padgett for Grupo Imagen, appears to show drugs being sold in plain sight in front of the engineering school on the main campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico - UNAM), whose sprawling complex accomodates nearly 350,000 students and more than 30,000 staff each academic year. In the video, at least two groups of microtraffickers appear to sell drugs to Padgett without any concern or difficulty. Padgett was able to purchase marijuana, crack cocaine, powder cocaine, heroin and LSD from the group, adding that there was ""nothing he couldn't buy."" (See video below) However, one individual discovered Padgett was filiming the transaction with a small camera as he was purchasing drugs from one of the groups. ""Are you recording there with your cell phone?"" one of the sellers asks. Pedgett repeatedly denies the accusation, asserting that he is not recording. The apparent drug dealers then take out three pistols and proceed to threaten and physically attack Padgett. ""What do you want more, your work or your life?"" they taunt him. After the video surfaced online and reports of the incident were widely shared by various Mexican news outlets, UNAM denounced the attacks against Padgett in a statement and filed a complaint with the Attorney General's Office (Procuraduria General de la Republica - PGR). In the statement, UNAM claims that the individuals are ""unaffiliated"" with the university and have already been reported to the proper authorities ""numerous times."" The university added that it will ""continue to promote the necessary measures needed to combat the sale of illegal substances in university spaces."" The latest video appears to further prove the inability of security forces -- whether federal or campus police -- to control organized crime groups in Mexico. UNAM and other large universities are, of course, not strangers to petty drug dealing. In June of this year, 13 presumed microtraffickers in possession of various drugs, primarily cocaine and marijuana, were arrested on UNAM's campus. And shortly after that, a network of at least 20 individuals linked to the Tlahuac Cartel -- a group engaged in drug trafficking, extortion, kidnapping and homicide in and around Mexico City -- was discovered to be operating on the campus. The network allegedly sold marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, LSD and hashish, earning more than 100,000 pesos (more than $5,600) per day. However, authorities have struggled to curtail the group's activities, despite the fact that they have been linked to violent and sophisticated criminal activities. Campus security forces have carried out two operations to try and arrest the network's leaders, but have been unsuccessful as the individuals allegedly use other students as ""shields"" to exit campus property, using scooters to then disappear into Mexico City's busy streets. The failure to drive microtraffickers from UNAM's campus reflects a broader struggle by authorities in Mexico City to deal with such crime groups. Officials have resisted acknowledging the presence of organized crime in Mexico City in the past despite evidence suggesting otherwise, and seem at a loss for a strategy for how to deal with their increasingly brazen operations."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Senators Trial Points to Modern-Day Slaves in Brazil. The upcoming Supreme Court trial of a senator in Brazil charged with employing workers in 'slave-like conditions' highlights the issue of forced labor in the country, which affects as many as 40,000 people. When auditors from the Labor Ministry inspected Senator Joao Ribeiro's farm in 2004, they found 35 employees forced into working nearly 80-hour weeks under conditions described as ""sub-human."" Ribeiro, who was re-elected to the Senate in 2010, has been embroiled in a legal suit ever since, which will soon be heard by Brazil's highest court of law. Workers had allegedly been brought to Ribeiro's farm attracted by the promise of a decent salary, but once they arrived they racked up debts with the management and were coerced into staying. Such practices are especially common in rural states along the Amazonian frontier like Para, where Ribeiro kept his country estates. Employers charge their laborers for food, housing, and equipment, withholding their wages until their debts are paid off. Workers are forced to keep long hours and safety regulations are ignored. More recently, 24 workers were freed by a federal task force in the northeast Piaui state. The labourers were fed spoiled food, and forced to pay for their housing, transportation, and the tools they used for work. According to Rogenir Costa, the head of Brazil programs for humanitarian agency Catholic Relief Services, there are between 25,000 and 40,000 slaves in Brazil. Most work in the cattle industry, but slaves also work in sugar cane fields, mines, and factories. Workers are often recruited by fixers known as gatos. The gatos lure workers to farms, ranches, and factories where they are then coerced into working under illegal conditions, but as Costa noted, some workers follow their families into slavery because they have no other opportunities. She said 80 percent of these modern slaves are illiterate and 90 percent were already working by age 16. Those who try to escape may be threatened with violence. A recent report from O Globo told the story of Daniel Moraes Ferreira, who worked in stonemasonry in the Amazonian state Matto Grosso. His employers were armed and patrolled the work site constantly. ""When the police cars show up, the slaves are put in the brush and hidden. I couldn't leave the farm. How, with a .38 revolver threatening me? Anyone who leaves is beaten or shot,"" he said. The problem is not confined to rural areas. Spanish high-fashion retailer Zara was denounced in August 2011 for its relationship with a Brazilian supplier that employed 14 Bolivians and one Peruvian in an illegal Sao Paulo ""sweatshop."" While Zara quickly ended its relationship with that supplier, the scandal was a reminder that multinationals that have outsourced work to Brazil still risk hiring subcontractors reliant on forced labor. While most of Brazil's forced labor victims originate from poor states like Piaui, Tocantins, and Bahia, to a lesser extent Brazil is also a destination for labourers trafficked from other Latin American countries. Costa told InSight Crime that Bolivians and Peruvians are frequently employed in slave-like conditions in Brazil. This suggests that the gatos prey on migrant workers, who are particularly vulnerable to labor abuse. Police are rescuing more workers from illegal conditions in a higher number of states, an encouraging sign that the government has successfully expanded their operations against slave labor. In 2010, according to a report from Brazil's Ministry of Labor and Employment (MTE), authorities rescued 2,628 workers. And according to Brazilian NGO the Pastoral Land Commission, in 2011 authorities freed slaves in 19 states, a number which had never risen above 15 before 2006. But even so, those who are rescued from slavery reportedly represent less than 10 percet of the total number of estimated victims. Successful prosecutions are few and far between, which is partly why Senator Ribeiro's case may prove to be a landmark one, should the Supreme Court find him guilty of slave labor charges. Gulnara Shahinian, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on slavery, has urged the country to pass legislation allowing the expropriation of land used for forced labor, which so far has not occured. Many offending employers operate with relative impunity even once they are caught. The statute of limitations for slavery cases often expires by the time cases are processed in the Labor Courts, which handle labor violations. This, along with relatively weak sentences, means employers in certain industries and regions have little incentive to play by the rules. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Tamaulipas Kidnapping Highlights Insecurity in Border Region. The abduction of 15 individuals from a bus traveling between Mexico's northeastern states of Tamaulipas and Coahuila highlights insecurity in Mexico's border states, and recalls previous episodes of mass kidnappings of migrants as immigration into the United States surges. The incident, which occurred on September 12, was not confirmed until September 14 by Coahuila's state secretary, Victor Zamora, according to Animal Politico. Minutes after leaving the bus station in the city of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, which sits near the Coahuila border, the bus was intercepted by armed men, the driver told officials. The 15 individuals were forced off the bus, loaded into various vehicles, and driven away. It is believed the bus was carrying migrants who were traveling to Coahuila in order to find human smugglers, known as ""coyotes,"" to take them across the border. However, this has not been confirmed, according to El Pais. The driver, employed by bus company Transportes Frontera (Border Transit), was reluctant to report the incident after receiving threats from the gunmen. Out of fear for his life, he declined to describe the faces of the kidnappers or their vehicles, reported Animal Politico. While the bus driver reported the incident to Coahuila officials, representatives from Coahuila's state government said the kidnapping occurred in Tamaulipas. However, Tamaulipas' Attorney General's Office has denied the kidnapping took place in its territory, reported Animal Politico. Although unconfirmed whether the kidnapped travelers were migrants, it remains a strong possibility. For years, kidnappings of migrants has been a common occurrence in Tamaulipas -- which has some of the highest missing person rates in Mexico -- where they are extorted, held for ransom, forced to transport drugs, or even killed by criminal groups. Additionally, recent reports indicate kidnappings of migrants by crime groups in Mexico could be on the rise. In March, for instance, 24 Honduran migrants were kidnapped in Altamira, Tamaulipas while traveling aboard a bus, though they were soon rescued by a security operation. San Fernando, Tamaulipas is also where, in 2010, 72 migrants were infamously massacred by gunmen on a ranch. This most recent kidnapping comes as US Border Patrol statistics show that, for the second time in three years, the agency is apprehending more non-Mexican than Mexican migrants along the southwest border. This is largely due to continued heightened migrant flows out of Central America as people look to flee poverty and violence. According to the Texas Tribune , the majority of these migrants are seeking to cross in the Rio Grande Valley along Texas' southernmost tip, where Tamaulipas and Coahuila are located. This area is contested by the Gulf Cartel and Zetas, with both groups having been known to target migrants as a source of revenue."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Mexico Seeks New Approach to Tackling Environmental Crime. Authorities in Mexico have called for legal reforms that would link environmental and organized crime, a measure which -- if adopted -- could lead to a significant improvement in how governments across Latin America combat the scourge of illicit wildlife trafficking. During a recent conference on wildlife and forest crime held in Cancun, representatives from Mexico's Attorney General's Office for Environmental Protection (Profepa) said the lack of a normative framework linking environmental and organized crime has impeded effective action against the region's eco-traffickers, reported El Universal. Israel Alvarado, Director of Profepa's environmental crimes unit, spoke of the necessity for legal reforms throughout the region that recognize the connection between environmental and organized crime. Alvarado said eco-traffickers use the same methods and routes as drug and arms traffickers, and that linking the two would permit investigators to use tools already being utilized in the fight against organized crime, such as wiretaps, electronic surveillance and undercover operations. Alvarado also suggested considering earnings derived from eco-trafficking as a form of money laundering, thereby allowing banking institutions and financial investigation units to help dismantle these networks. The conference, which was organized by Profepa and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), was intended to identify common strategies for combating environmental crime, and was attended by representatives from 16 Latin American and Caribbean countries. Calls for linking environmental crime with organized crime is perhaps indicative of a growing awareness about the prevalence of eco-trafficking in Latin America, and the need for legal measures to combat its detrimental effects. The black market for wildlife is big business , netting traffickers an estimated $19 billion per year globally. Owing to its biodiversity, Latin America is a key region sourcing this illicit trade, with the practice of "" shark finning "" -- whereby sharks are killed for their fins to make shark fin soup, a delicacy in Asia -- a particularly acute problem. Indeed, just days following the conclusion of the conference in Cancun, Mexican authorities confiscated 3,559 kilos of shark fins and 529 fish bladders (also used to make soup) that were destined for Hong Kong. In addition to wildlife trafficking, illegal logging is another major criminal industry in several countries throughout the region , most notably Peru and Brazil. The challenge of confronting eco-trafficking in Latin America is compounded by several issues. These include a general lack of awareness, weak legal enforcement, and a host of criminal groups with pre-existing smuggling networks ready to profit from the trade. As such, if Latin American countries do in fact start to pursue eco-traffickers much as they already do organized crime networks, this would likely be an important step towards tackling a trade that has had devastating environmental impacts throughout the region."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Catholic Church: Pawn or Player in Gang Truce?Before Bishop Fabio Colindres told Salvadoran government mediators in early 2012 that he would participate in a secret negotiation to stop the fighting between El Salvador's two largest gangs, three top level Catholic Church officials had already told the government representatives that they wanted nothing to do with the talks. Colindres' decision to participate in the controversial gang truce could have far reaching consequences for the Church, one of El Salvador's most respected institutions. The rifts caused by Colindres' participation in the truce -- which was signed by El Salvador's two largest street gangs, the MS-13 and the Barrio 18 in March of last year -- are still playing out in this Central American nation of seven million people. On May 12, the Catholic Conference of Bishops, the collective body of the Church hierarchy, emitted a public statement questioning the truce. ""The truce has not produced any benefits for the honorable and hard-working population,"" the statement reads, adding that extortions and other gang-related criminal activities have not slowed. The following is a condensed version of a white paper on the Catholic Church's role in El Salvador's Gang Truce. It was financed and published by American University and the Henry Luce Foundation. See full version here ( pdf ). Brokering a deal with what most Salvadorans believe are parasitic criminals who prey on the weakest in society was always going to come at a cost. In return for stopping the nearly constant bloodshed between them in that country, the Salvadoran government agreed to transfer 30 of the gangs' leaders from a maximum-security facility to other prisons around the country, increased visitation rights and removed the military from various jails. There were reportedly other concessions, such as cash payments, but these were not made public nor are they confirmed. The government has since pushed for more social and economic programs for the gang members in order to better integrate them into Salvadoran economic life and push them from the criminal activities that currently sustain them. The truce was brokered by an ex-guerrilla and former congressman, Raul Mijango, and Colindres, the military chaplain. They had negotiated in secret for months prior to the announcement under the auspices of the country's security minister, retired Army General David Munguia. And in the weeks after the truce came to light, they claimed they had worked independently of the government. As it turned out, Mijango had long been a consultant for Munguia, while Colindres, because of his role as the military chaplain, had a close relationship with the security minister. The government later accepted that it had ""facilitated"" the process but has consistently tried to keep its distance. This is understandable given that the gang truce could be, in many ways, a political time bomb. Swapping homicides for better prison conditions is a dangerous proposition - a de facto nod that the gangs' violent ways had secured them enough political capital to negotiate with the government at the highest levels. The gangs remain very unpopular. They have no formal political representation and have done little to develop a coherent political platform. Their strength relies on numbers - there could be as many 65,000 active members - and their willingness to use force, which they often employ to victimize the weakest and most defenseless in their communities. Colindres' role was particularly controversial because he is a bishop, a member of the Church hierarchy. His participation was, in essence, a nod from the country's Catholic Church that brokering this truce was in the interest of El Salvador, despite misgivings from some of his colleagues. It seemed to help legitimize the process to the public and the country's elite. Colindres is from the Church's more conservative wing, thus his participation may also serve as a means to involve the business community in what is an ongoing process. The Bishop told InSight Crime he had decided to participate without consulting the Catholic Conference of Bishops and that he was motivated by the Church's long-standing humanitarian role, specifically in improving the conditions for prisoners. However, the Church's role appears to be more symbolic than real. Colindres was not Munguia's or Mijango's first choice, and the negotiators openly stated they needed a Church representative in order to legitimize the truce. The Conference of Bishops, while it voiced its support of its Bishop initially, has stayed mostly quiet since and even, to a certain extent, distanced itself from Colindres, leading many to believe there is a deep divide within the Church over how to deal with the truce. The May 12 statement seems to confirm this divide. Although signed by Colindres , the statement comes just weeks after Colindres himself visited the United States in an attempt to promote the truce. There are many other factors in play that have led to divisions within the Church over Colindres' decision to participate in the truce. Colindres' appears content to play this small, even symbolic role. Others in the Church would like to play a more active role in shaping the truce and implementing the programs to sustain it; or, at the very least, establish conditions upon which the Church will participate. Colindres has isolated himself and the process with the gangs, keeping some of the Church at arm's length. The Bishop seems oblivious to the possible political consequences for the Church should the truce unravel, and the Church seems powerless to stop him from participating. Untangling Colindres' and the Church's role in the truce is not easy. Despite its success in lowering homicide rates by half - a remarkable accomplishment by any measure - and moves into the next phases of implementing job training and other economic programs, the truce is not universally popular. Polls show most people are skeptical of the gangs' intentions and the truce's possible consequences, particularly as they relate the country's political future. The international community is also divided. The United States Government has expressed concern, while the Organization of American States has sent emissaries to facilitate the ongoing process. For his part, Colindres defends his actions and says the naysayers are jealous of his role. It is a role he seems to embrace even as the truce moves into its next phase. Ironically, the government's callous use of the Church and Colindres' isolation from its hierarchy may play a role in the truce's undoing. Neither the government nor Colindres can implement the next phase of the truce without the backing of institutions like the Church. However, at this point, that fence may be too hard to mend. *This is part of white paper series produced by American University's Center for Latin American and Latino Studies ' multi-year project of research and structured dialogue on religion and violence in Latin America.

Honduras Military Crackdown Faces Legal Challenge. A campaign group in Honduras has filed a suit with the Supreme Court challenging the government's use of the military in a policing role, which is a central part of the government's security strategy. The Committee of Families of Disappeared and Detainees in Honduras (COFADEH) filed a claim with the Honduran Supreme Court on June 30 against the government's decision to grant police powers to the military. The victims' advocacy group argues that the military's presence in the streets is unconstitutional because it violates the separation between military and police roles. The suit comes after the Honduran Council of Ministers approved a 90-day extension of the military's powers. This is third extension so far. Minister of Defense Marlon Pascua argues that the military is necessary to fight crime, and that its role in policing has been largely successful. One of the advocates for the suit is Wilfredo Yanez, the father of 15-year-old Eved Yanez who was allegedly killed by members of the Honduran military in May. In recent years, Honduras has become an important transshipment point for US-bound cocaine. The Central American country has also seen an increase in cocaine processing, which is believed to be operated by Mexican cartels. It struggles with several violent gangs, including Mara Salvatrucha ( MS-13 ) and Barrio 18 , and currently has the highest murder rate in the world. In 2011, President Porfirio Lobo deployed troops in the cities of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula in an effort to crack down on rising violence. The military is seen as a more trustworthy force than the police, who have been hit by accusations of widespread corruption. In March this year, Lobo proposed a constitutional reform to create a permanent military police force. Latin American countries' growing reliance on military forces to fight crime worries human rights advocates. Granting police powers to the military not only avoids addressing problems like corruption within the police, but can also risks undermining human rights. Soldiers are not trained in police procedures and are not used to working in such close quarters with civilians, which can put civilians at risk of abuses. In a region with a history of military coups, giving more powers to the military has a potential to destabilize the power balance between civilian and military authorities. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Ecuador Emerges as Trafficking Hub for Perus Illegal Gold. An investigation in Ecuador has revealed how the country has become a major transit hub for illegal Peruvian gold exported to the United States, an evolution directly linked to Peru's attempts to crack down on gold trafficking. Case files obtained by El Comercio have exposed the inner workings of the alleged illegal gold trafficking network exposed last month after a series of raids and arrests linked to two gold exporters, Clearprocess and Spartan. According to El Comercio, prosecutors allege the two companies employed emissaries to strike deals with Peruvian gold smugglers on the border between the two countries. The companies then exported the gold. Prosecutors allege the precious metal's illegal and foreign origins were concealed using falsified documents and identities stolen from legally registered Ecuadorians, El Comercio reported. After 2013, the two companies grew rapidly to become Ecuador's principal gold exporters, according to a statement issued by the government , which named their main customers as the US-based companies Republic Metals Corporation (RMC), Kaloti Metals and Logistics (KML), and Mvp Imports. Police arrested seven executives from Clearprocess and Spartan in the June raids, and they have since been charged with money laundering, El Comercio reported. The emergence of Ecuador as a transit point for Peruvian gold is a direct consequence of Peru's attempts to introduce traceability into its supply chain and prevent illegal gold from being laundered into the legal supply. Until 2012, there was little oversight of gold exports in Peru, but new legislation and a shift in security priorities to focus on illegal mining led to high profile seizures and investigations, and by 2014 half of all Peru's gold exporters had fallen under suspicion. In 2015, Peruvian investigators told InSight Crime this had resulted in a shift in trafficking patterns, with illegal gold increasingly smuggled across the border into Bolivia then exported with false paperwork identifying its origins as Bolivian. This pattern now appears to be repeating itself in Ecuador, with both countries showing the telltale discrepancy between gold mined in the country and gold exported -- in Ecuador's case a $949 million gap in the period 2012-2014, according to government figures. While the export patterns in the regional gold trade are changing, the same names continue to surface as the international buyers of this allegedly illegal gold. RMC, for example has been embroiled in several illegal mining scandals in Colombia. The owners of one of its former suppliers, Goldex, are currently on trial for money laundering, while another, Giraldo y Duque is under investigation. As a result, the company has scaled back its operations in Colombia and now only buys from one mining company with a legal title. KML, meanwhile, has been named as the intended recipient of allegedly illegal gold seized in Peru and has had ties to several exporters suspected of money laundering and linked to alleged organized crime kingpins. InSight Crime's reporting of these connections has led to threats of legal action from Kaloti. RMC Responds: Following publication of this article, RMC contacted InSight Crime to request a clarification on the company's current gold buying policy, which was developed in response to the scandals in Colombia and growing concerns over gold trafficking and money laundering in the Americas. Jason Rubin, RMC's CEO, said: ""RMC has ceased doing business with any aggregators as part of its continuing efforts to prevent gold operations from being used for money laundering. RMC only deals with single source mining entities. RMC made this decision to address some of the problems you discuss in the Article, including exporters attempting to conceal the illegal and foreign origins of gold using falsified documents. RMC recognizes the challenges facing the gold industry and, as a responsible refinery, is attempting to lead by example when it comes to thwarting illegal gold trafficking networks."""	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Brazil Beheading Video Draws Attention to Gang Turf War. A video has emerged depicting the beheading of a teenager in Brazil, in what could be an escalation of a brutal turf war between two rival gangs. Police are investigating a video believed to show the decapitation of 16 or 17-year-old Israel Melo Junior, whose head was discovered in a bag on February 2 in the southern state of Santa Catarina, Globo reported. The motivation behind the crime is so far unknown, however according to Estadao it is suspected that Junior's murder was the result of fighting between the gangs First Catarinense Group (Primeiro Grupo da Catarinense - PGC) and First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC). PGC allegedly controls drug trafficking in Santa Catarina, while PCC is based in Sao Paolo state. In the video, a man wearing a mask uses an axe to behead the teenager, who appears to be dead. The body receives approximately 30 blows. At least two other people, whose faces are covered, also appear. The group seems to be in a forest. Some hypotheses currently being explored include the possibility that the young boy collaborated with a rival gang, that there was a clash over debts, and that the decapitation was part of a ritual. The teenager had previously been involved in drug trafficking-related offenses, according to the Military Police. Police official Fabiano Silveira stated that the area in which the boy's head was found, the northern part of Joinville district, is known for being a disputed area for drug trafficking. The rest of the victim's body has not yet been found. The gruesome video appears to be connected to a violent push for territorial expansion by the PCC. According to police intelligence , Brazil's largest gang has for some time had its sights set on expanding its drug and arms trafficking operations into Santa Catarina. The PCC has been spreading its tentacles since at least 2006 , although past incursions into Santa Catarina were mostly pacific, with local gangs receiving training and sharing criminal earnings with PCC members. Now, however, the PCC is being met with resistance by the PGC, which is considered a local faction of the larger gang. The state governor of Santa Catarina, Raimundo Colombo, acknowledged this in 2015 by saying ""There is fighting between PCC and PGC. They battle it out all the time."" The dissemination of the beheading video online is a potential sign the turf war between the PCC and PGC has intensified. ""Posting a video of a decapitation online in a public forum is unprecedented,"" Lloyd Belton, a political risk analyst at the consultancy firm S-RM, told InSight Crime. ""[This] would indicate that the perpetrators clearly want to get a message across to rival gang members and also garner public attention."" That said, such barbaric acts are not uncommon among criminal groups in Brazil. Decapitations themselves are ""a common method of execution used by gang members against other gang members or informant[s],"" according to S-RM's local security source."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Dominican Republic Drags Feet on Investigating Narcos Claims. The Dominican Republic Attorney General's Office said there are no plans to investigate allegations that a convicted drug trafficker financed the campaign of a former president, the latest chapter in a long-running saga that has been illustrative of the depth of corruption in the country. Last week, Quirino Paulino Castillo -- one of the Dominican Republic's most notorious drug traffickers -- said that he lent former President Leonel Fernandez around $4.5 million. He also said that he wrote Fernandez a letter demanding repayment of a $222,000 loan. Fernandez, who served as the Dominican Republic's president twice, has denied the claims. The country's attorney general has now said that he ""cannot tell at this point if we will start an investigation,"" according to Diario Libre. He added that Dominican authorities would not look into Paulino's claims unless they received supporting evidence from US counterparts suggesting that such a tie between Paulino and the ex-president exists. Paulino was extradited to the United States in 2005 after being arrested with 1.3 tons of cocaine that was en route to the US. He was released from prison last year, but still resides in the United States. Why Paulino is coming forward now and making claims of corruption against Fernandez nearly 10 years after his arrest and extradition to the US is somewhat of a mystery. Some have said Paulino is simply trying to smear those who were responsible for dismantling his criminal organization and confronting Dominican organized crime. Paulino, on the other hand, claims that the economic situation of his family is desperate, and that he needs back the money he allegedly lent to Fernandez. Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic attorney general's office has made it clear that for now, they don't intend to probe too deeply into his allegations. While the claims of a convicted drug trafficker against those responsible for his downfall understandably lack standing, they are not beyond the realm of belief. Paulino previously served as an army captain, and made donations to several political campaigns and causes in the Dominican Republic before his arrest in 2004. The Dominican Republic has long struggled with corruption , and the country's illegal transnational drug trade has badly corroded public institutions. Indeed, it may be that the final chapter of the Paulino saga has yet to be written, and his allegations against Fernandez may yet prove to hold weight."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
El Salvador Disappearances Down From Post-Gang Truce Peak. Newly reported statistics from El Salvador's National Civil Police indicate that disappearances have declined from a peak reached in 2014 after the dissolution of a controversial gang truce, raising questions about the relationship between the truce and the rate of disappearances. According to a September 15 article from El Diario de Hoy, police recorded 838 disappearances between January 1 and July 19 of this year. That figure represents an average of around 129 disappearances per month. Men made up the majority of the victims, with 569 cases representing nearly 70 percent of the total. Young people under the age of 30 were also particularly affected, with 530 cases representing nearly two-thirds of the total. Police statistics available through the government's online transparency portal show that the monthly average of disappearances grew steadily from 2011 through 2014, when they reached a peak average of more than 187 per month. Since then, disappearances appear to have been in gradual decline. From January to September 2015, police recorded an average of about 159 per month , and roughly 129 per month were recorded through July of this year. (See InSight Crime's graphic below) Some experts have argued that disappearances increased during the government-brokered gang truce between April 2012 and June 2013 as a result of gangs seeking to cover up evidence of ongoing murders that would have violated the terms of the pact. Homicides did appear to decrease during the truce, but Salvadoran security officials have publicly disagreed about whether that drop was related to the rise in disappearances. The available numbers appear to show that while disappearances did increase during the truce, the monthly average continued to rise the following year. Moreover, the average of 159 disappearances recorded monthly by the police in 2015 remained above the monthly average of 148 disappearances recorded during the 16 months the truce was in effect. However, there are numerous issues with the accuracy of the Salvadoran government's disappearance statistics that make it difficult to draw solid conclusions based on the numbers alone. It is possible that other, less-understood factors contributed to the rise and gradual decline in the number of reported disappearances in recent years.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Medellin Kingpin Sebastian Extradited to the US. Colombia has extradited former Medellin crime boss ""Sebastian"" to the United States, posing the question of whether he will collaborate with the authorities and what impact it will have on the city underworld if he does. Erickson Vargas Cardona, alias ""Sebastian,"" was originally captured in August 2012 on a farm outside Medellin. At the time of his arrest he was head of the Oficina de Envigado crime syndicate, which controlled the organized crime networks stretching throughout the Aburra Valley, where Medellin is situated. Sebastian was extradited on October 16 alongside a dozen others to face drug trafficking and money laundering charges, reported El Tiempo. Sebastian rose to the top of the Medellin underworld after triumphing in a bloody war for the leadership of the Oficina with Maximiliano Bonilla Orozco, alias ""Valenciano,"" who was arrested in Venezuela in November 2011. Since the capture of Sebastian, who has been described as the Oficina's ""last grand capo,"" nobody has firmly taken the reins of the organization, which fractured into various factions. The narco-paramilitary group the Urabenos, which had been slowly maneuvering itself into position to challenge for control of Medellin, capitalized on the power vacuum to launch an assault against the remnants of the Oficina. The war continued until a truce was signed earlier this year. Sebastian's extradition raises the question of what information he might give up in return for a more favorable sentence. He has been involved in the Medellin underworld since he was a youth, and has an intimate knowledge of the remaining Oficina de Envigado structures, the loose-knit networks they manage, and their powerful backers from the Medellin social and business elite. Following the truce between the Oficina and the Urabenos, the Medellin underworld has been divided up between the now cooperating organizations. If Sebastian were to give up some of his former allies and lieutenants, this could push the balance of this pact in favor of the Urabenos, as they could push to fill any gaps left by Oficina figures betrayed by Sebastian with their own people.

"Colonel Accuses Presidents of Venezuela and Bolivia of Smuggling Cocaine. In a series of contentious but dubious allegations, a former military official from Bolivia has accused the presidents of Bolivia and Venezuela of conspiring to traffic cocaine into Spain. On May 8, Brazilian news outlet Veja published excerpts from a 34-page report obtained from Bolivian Colonel Romulo German Cardona. The report -- dated February 20 and labeled ""Top Secret"" -- alleges that, then Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Bolivian President Evo Morales started laying the groundwork for the movement of cocaine through Spain as long as six years ago. The policy continues through today, the report states, under the leadership of current Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Morales. In his report, Cardona, who is in now in Spain seeking asylum, says that Peruvian and Bolivian cocaine would be sent via official government and military aircraft -- such as the Hercules C-130s -- since these aircraft ""cannot be intercepted in international air space."" Once in Venezuela, the report adds, the cocaine would be repackaged in Caracas for direct shipment to Europe, bypassing ""the bridges of Iran, Russia, Libya,"" and other countries, such as Greece. In an April 2015 interview with Veja , Cardona went further, saying that Bolivia's Minister of the Presidency, Juan Ramon Quintana, is heading what he called the ""Cartel of the Stars."" Cardona said the Bolivian group an extension of Venezuela's ""Cartel of the Suns."" According to Cardona, like its counterpart in Venezuela, the Cartel of the Stars is comprised of high-ranking Bolivian military and police officials (the suns and stars is a reference to the insignias on the epaulets on the officers' uniforms used to denote rank). Perhaps most incredibly, Cardona also alleged that Morales personally negotiates drug flights with Maduro. He also implicated Bolivian Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera and his brother Raul as part of the operations. Cardona said he gave this report to General Jose Luis Begazo -- the commander of the Bolivian army -- in February, and, due to government persecution, had to flee to Spain on April 19. In response to Cardona's allegations, the Bolivian Armed Forces have accused him of desertion and have begun a series of disciplinary processes against him. Bolivian Minister of Defense Reymi Ferreira has also petitioned Spain to deny Cardona's asylum request, as that would imply he was being politically persecuted in Bolivia, which authorities deny. There are reasons to believe that there is high-level collusion in drug trafficking operations in both Bolivia and Venezuela. Venezuelan government officials have been repeatedly linked to drug trafficking , the latest accusations coming from a new book by a well-known journalist. And Cardona is not the first Bolivian official to allege ties between the Morales government and the drug trade. In 2012, a Bolivian Senator made similar accusations and fled to Brazil to seek asylum. Bolivian Minister Juan Ramon Quintana has also been linked to drug trafficking activities in the past. What's more, before defecting to Spain, Colonel Cardona had an accomplished military career, and -- in addition to being a lawyer and having worked as the judicial adviser for the Army's Eighth Division -- had been a university professor and director of a military hospital. Nonetheless, Cardona may have stretched the truth, perhaps due to political differences with Morales and his highlands superiors. Born in a small town in eastern Bolivia near Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Cardona was one of the best cadets in his class at the Military Academy but felt discriminated against because of his Santa Cruz origins. One of his former students reportedly described him as very critical of the government, saying he would advise them not to follow a military career, ""because there is always someone above you giving orders."" The Bolivian government has denied all of Cardona's accusations , and -- perhaps given his resentment towards the military -- called his recent actions ""paranoid behavior aimed at tarnishing the credibility of the armed forces."" Authorities have even suggested he is suffering from hallucinations, saying he has received poor scores on health tests in the past. Indeed, Cardona has apparently been suffering from poor health during the past year, something he attributes to government persecution against him and his family. Cardona says he could be assassinated at any moment. This -- along with high-level collusion amongst military officers in drug trafficking -- might be true, but his suggestion that the presidents of Bolivia and Venezuela are part of a larger, Machiavellian master strategy to move cocaine into Europe through Spain on military aircraft requires a more significant stretch of the imagination although it is not totally impossible."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Are Firearms Seizures Why Homicides Are Falling in Nicaragua?Authorities in Nicaragua have identified the seizure of thousands of firearms over the past several years as the main reason for a large drop in the country's homicide rate, but experiences around the region suggest the issue is unlikely to be so simple. According to Nicaragua's National Police, the seizure of 19,000 illegally owned firearms between 2008 and 2013 has played a critical role in reducing the country's homicide rate from 11 homicides per 100,000 residents in 2012 to 8.7 homicides per 100,000 in 2013, reported El Nuevo Diario. Nicaragua currently has the lowest homicide rate in Central America, followed by Costa Rica. Nonetheless, officials from the arms control unit of the police (DAEM) said the majority of violent robberies in the country were not carried out with firearms, but rather, with weapons such as knives or machetes. The low homicide rate does not mean the country is unaffected by violent crime, said Monica Zalaquett of NGO the Violence Prevention Center (CEPREV). ""There are a lot of robberies [in Nicaragua] using intimidation, in which firearms are generally used and many young people sustain bullet injuries,"" she said. Compared to its Northern Triangle neighbors Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- which have some of the highest homicide rates in the world -- Nicaragua remains relatively unaffected by gangs or organized crime-fueled violence. Last year, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) placed Nicaragua among the six Latin American countries with the best citizen security indicators. However, it is unlikely arms seizures have been the primary factor in maintaining low levels of violence. As InSight Crime has noted , there is little evidence that strict gun policies are a principal factor affecting murder rates in Latin America -- ease of acquiring black market weapons, security force corruption and a strong organized crime presence all play an important role as well. There are a number of other factors that have likely contributed to Nicaragua's low -- and falling -- homicide rate. One often cited by authorities is the country's unique community policing model , which has been credited with keeping out mara street gangs. Another possibility could be the tight social control exercised by the Sandinista government in many parts of the country. These ideas are supported by the fact that the country's two Atlantic autonomous regions (the RAAN and RAAS) have murder rates far above the national average. These are the regions where the central government has the least control, and which have been most affected by the presence of transnational organized crime as both their remoteness and coastal location make them attractive stopover points for drug traffickers."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Canada Marijuana Legalization Puts Spotlight on LatAm Drug Policy. Recreational marijuana in Canada is now officially legal, and while the change is unlikely to have a significant impact on Latin America's black market, it could trigger a shift towards more progressive international drug policies. On October 17, Canada became the largest country in the world to fully legalize the use of recreational marijuana. Lawmakers in the North American nation passed in June 2018 Bill-C45 before marijuana legalization officially went into effect this October. Canada is the second country in the region to legalize recreational marijuana consumption after Uruguay became the first to do so in December 2013 before beginning legal sales in December 2017. Several US states have also legalized marijuana despite federal prohibition and other countries in the region are currently debating proposals to allow for medicinal use or decriminalize personal use. A fter the bill was passed, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in a statement that it regretted Canada's decision to legalize recreational marijuana use as it ""undermines the international legal drug control framework."" On the other hand, Canada Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould called the decision a ""historic milestone"" in a June tweet. ""This legislation will help protect our youth from the risks of cannabis while keeping profits out of the hands of criminals and organized crime,"" she added. Latin America Black Market Impact Marijuana legalization in Canada is not likely to have a major effect on Latin America's black market, particularly in Mexico and Colombia, historically two of the region's main suppliers of marijuana in North America. Mexican marijuana traditionally fed US market demand amid the drug's prohibition at the federal level before states started moving towards legalization. In contrast, much of Canada's black market marijuana comes from home growers in the country and more recently from northern US states along or near the US-Canada border, such as Washington and Oregon , that have legalized marijuana. ""Cannabis legalization in Canada will not have any significant effect on black markets in Mexico because most of the Mexican cannabis going north stays in the United States,"" Lisa Sanchez, Latin America Program Manager at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, told InSight Crime. ""I'm not sure we'll see a reduction in illicit crops or violence in Mexico."" Organized crime groups in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, have adjusted to declining demand for marijuana north of the border as more US states legalize the drug. Criminal groups are now increasingly involved in trafficking heroin and synthetic drugs like fentanyl to meet demand for opioids in the United States, in addition to trafficking cocaine to meet US demand as coca production booms in Colombia. The amount of marijuana seized by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has also declined in recent years. (Marijuana seizures by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) c/o Adam Isacson ) A Move Towards Changing International Drug Treaties Marijuana legalization in Canada may not have an immediate impact on Latin America's drug market, but it could help lead a shift towards modifying international drug treaties to be more progressive and in line with evolving global thinking on drugs, which could over time impact the region's organized crime groups. ""Inter se modification"" of international drug treaties regarding marijuana is one such option. This is when two or more countries join together and allow for the ""production, trade and consumption"" of marijuana for recreational purposes while ""minimizing the impact"" on other countries and international drug conventions, according to a March 2018 joint-report from the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), Transnational Institute (TNI) and Global Drug Policy Observatory (GDPO). Canada has the potential to play a very important role in exploring the feasibility and desirability of this option for countries in Latin America. Its reputation as a strong global citizen could help other countries in the region make a push for more forward-thinking drug policies, according to John Walsh, WOLA's Director for Drug Policy, who co-authored the 2018 report. ""I think different counties are coming to a similar conclusion [as Canada], that cannabis prohibition just doesn't work for them,"" Walsh said. ""It's an unworkable policy because you have a market that exists and attempting to ban it doesn't make it go away, but increases the harm the market generates."" If more countries band together and opt for the inter se option to enact progressive drug policies, this wrestles the marijuana market away from illegal actors and deprives them of a revenue stream that's been fairly easy picking so far, which could over time have an impact on their relative strength and wherewithal. ""It would be naive to think the legal regulation of cannabis alone is in and of itself going to allow governments to tame organized crime and related corruption, that takes other ingredients of effective governance,"" Walsh said. ""But you can also make the case that legalization provides a way for governments to deprive criminal groups of significant revenues, which might make taming organized crime easier [in the long-term]."" That said, marijuana is not at the center of organized crime groups and their proceeds as it once was. Today, organized crime groups throughout the region partake in a multitude of criminal activities, from arms and contraband trafficking to illegal gold mining and oil theft. Some of these illicit industries are potentially more profitable than the drug trade. The Future of International Drug Policy While marijuana legalization alone is not likely to severely weaken organized crime groups in the region, the push for legalization falls in line with calls from authorities across the world for new and more innovative policies to curb the growing global drug market. Current efforts focused on repressing production have failed to suppress the black market or protect drug users. ""Legalization is a harm reduction measure that makes problems created by the black market more manageable and safer,"" Sanho Tree, the Director of the Drug Policy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies, told InSight Crime. Reaching a global consensus to ""revise or amend"" the UN drug control conventions to accommodate for marijuana legalization doesn't seem to be a ""viable political option in the foreseeable future."" Walsh argues that the polarized nature of the debate makes the inter se option more attractive, and provides a ""coordinated and collective response"" to the global drug problem. ""Inter se is explicitly a collective response and allows room to maneuver,"" Walsh said. ""It was designed so countries couldn't just turn their back on other treaty partners and leave them in the dark and not abide by commitments. There's protection in there for other countries."" Still, while countries in Latin America are increasingly exploring the legalization or decriminalization of some drugs, the overall consensus on the global drug problem still very much leans towards prohibition. A special session held by the UNODC in 2016 on the world drug problem revealed that the ""one size fits all"" UN drug conventions that were agreed upon decades ago -- which critics say are outdated and in need of revision -- ""constitute the cornerstone of the international drug control system.""

Amid Crisis, Venezuela Citizens Take Security Into Own Hands. Communities in Caracas are turning to private security and vigilante groups in response to the state failures behind Venezuela's security crisis, but examples from around the region show this can be a dangerous path to take. Several crime-plagued municipalities in the Caracas metropolitan area have taken to organizing security patrols mostly carried out by off duty or former members of the security forces, according to a report by El Nacional. In some cases, local businesses, institutions and residents have combined to pay for private security services, while in others the communities themselves have formed security groups that work in conjunction with the police. Residents say the patrols have reduced street crime, although some have opposed measures implemented by the groups, such as road closures and checkpoints, according to El Nacional. In addition, the groups operate in a legal grey area, especially with regards to the use of firearms and detaining suspects. Communities resorting to taking citizen security into their own hands is an understandable and perhaps inevitable consequence of the Venezuelan state's failures to control the country's security crisis. Venezuela is one of the most violent countries in the world, and crimes that affect the general population such as robberies, kidnappings and extortion have reached epidemic proportions. The police have consistently proven to be incapable of meeting the challenges of these security problems. The force is seen as weak, ineffective and corrupt , and even when it has tried to lead an assault on criminal networks, those networks have shown themselves more than willing to fight back. However, as numerous examples from around the region show, it can be hugely problematic when citizens start taking security into their own hands, as a lack of accountability and the temptations of corruption can often lead to abuses. In Brazil, vigilante security groups that, as in Venezuela, are composed of former or active security forces have evolved into criminal militias involved in everything from extortion to drug trafficking. In El Salvador, groups of off-duty security forces are believed to have formed anti-gang death squads. In even more extreme examples, vigilante groups in Mexico and Colombia have become powerful criminal organizations in their own right. Despite these warning signs, the Caracas communities are far from alone in believing citizens should fill the gap left by state failures, and vigilante justice is proving popular in countries around the region that are plagued by insecurity and have weak and ineffective state institutions.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Top 5 Heists by Security Forces in Latin America. From stealing chickens to hiding millions discovered in remote jungles, security forces in Latin America have been involved in a number of high-profile thefts. InSight Crime counts down the top heists committed by police and military in the region. This examination of security force theft was prompted by recent revelations that 22 police in Honduras stole $1.3 million dollars seized from a drug trafficking family and used the money to pay for prostitutes and buy cars and houses. 5. Venezuela Amid widespread food shortages, police in Caracas have been accused of stealing food from Food Ministry trucks. According to one driver responsible for a haul of 100,000 bolivares worth of poultry, the Caracas police stopped him as he was driving through the Venezuelan capital, then stole crates of chicken after he refused to pay a bribe. According to Venezuelan news website La Patilla, the driver filmed the incident, and later said that while he was at the police station, the police boasted that they charge all food distributors fees to move throughout the city and ""confiscate"" their merchandise if they refuse to comply. The truck driver also said that the Caracas cops claimed they'd pulled over some vegetable sellers so many times they'd driven them to the point of bankruptcy. 4. Peru At least 14 anti-drug police in Peru -- including the commander of the anti-drug unit in the northern city of Tarapoto -- have been accused of seizing coca base and reselling it to Peruvian and Colombian drug traffickers. Despite the fact that the anti-drug unit was assigned to one of the country's major coca production areas and had not reported any drug seizures in 2014, senior police officials did not order an investigation until an informant told authorities about what had happened. In addition to selling coca base, the corrupt cops also allegedly stole money from drug traffickers. On one occasion, police officers allegedly held the owner of a hotel hostage while they searched for two Colombian drug traffickers who were staying at the establishment so they could steal close to $500,000 dollars from them. 3. Honduras In an October 2014 operation that resulted in the arrest of two members of the Valle Valle drug trafficking family in Honduras, police discovered $12.5 million dollars buried in a plastic barrel. The police only reported the seizure of $11.2 million dollars, which were turned over to the agency in charge of seized assets. The 22 police officers then divided the remaining $1.3 million between themselves. Some of the police spent their bounty on prostitutes, while others purchased cars and houses. However, they aroused the suspicions of police intelligence agents with their sudden acquisition of luxury goods. They also gave themselves away thanks to Facebook: one of the suddenly-wealthy police officers wrote, ""thank you God for this gift and for taking me out of poverty"" on his profile wall. 2. Guatemala It's one thing to keep money seized during a police operation, and another to steal shipments of drugs and cash from active criminal groups. Although often carried out by rival drug traffickers, this type of activity -- known as a tumbe -- is sometimes perpetrated by corrupt police officers. In one such case, a police official in Guatemala allegedly stole a shipment of drugs and money from a criminal group in June 2013. A few days after the tumbe , thirteen hired assassins burst into the local police station and massacred eight police officers who were eating dinner there. The official who allegedly orchestrated the tumbe was taken hostage and pieces of his dismembered body were found a week later. The killings were attributed to Eduardo Francisco Villatoro Cano , alias ""Guayo Cano,"" the owner of the stolen drug shipment, who allegedly had ties to the Zetas. 1. Colombia In 2003, a group of 147 soldiers on a mission to rescue kidnapping victims stumbled across at least $20 million in cash buried in an abandoned Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) camp. There were so many bills in the buried containers that the soldiers used them to make bonfires and bet enormous sums of money on card games to entertain themselves. The soldiers used their new-found wealth to buy luxury goods and spend large quantities on prostitutes. Some of the soldiers attracted suspicion by resigning from the military, while others offered over $2,000 to whoever would cover their shifts in the army kitchen. One soldier even used his money to pay for a sex change operation. The millions attracted unwanted attention from more than just government officials, however. By the time the soldiers were finally sentenced in 2013, at least five had been killed and others had had their family members kidnapped. Only 86 are now serving time in jail, because authorities were unable to locate the remaining 56. The incredible story has served as the basis for a movie (see the trailer below) and a television series."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

"Guatemala VP Controlled, Influenced Media: Witness. A former vice president of Guatemala allegedly used her majority stake in two newspapers to try to influence their coverage of her administration, a stark reminder of the way in which direct control over media forms part of many political strategies. During her time in office under the administration of Otto Perez Molina (2012 - 2015), then Vice President Roxana Baldetti allegedly controlled 70 percent of the media group Corporacion de Noticias, reported La Prensa Grafica. Corporacion owns the dailies Siglo21 and Al Dia. The revelations came as part of a testimony offered by Salvador Gonzalez Alvarez, alias ""Eco,"" a former government functionary during the Perez Molina administration who on May 31 testified in a case known as ""Capture of the State"" ("" Cooptacion del Estado ""), which involves a series of pay-for-play schemes. The witness also claimed Baldetti used her power to ensure Siglo21 and Al Dia provided favorable coverage of the vice president and the government. As reported by La Hora , Eco said that in January 2015, Baldetti allegedly instructed Siglo21 to publish a supplement to congratulate the government for its third-year results. ""As the government published its third reportI asked the production team [at Siglo21] to give me some time because Baldetti wrote me saying she wanted us to publish a supplement congratulating the government for its third year in office,"" Eco was reported by La Hora as saying, adding that the former vice president seemed annoyed at the fact that he had not come up with the idea before. ""She sent me a message saying that we were those that should have come up with this sort of stuff, not her."" Baldetti and Perez Molina resigned and were arrested in 2015 after authorities discovered they were running a customs fraud network. Each of them is currently under investigation for three distinct corruption cases. The case is a powerful illustration of the ability of Guatemalan elites to co-opt different institutions in an effort to increase and sustain their power. It is certainly not rare in a region where elites routinely purchase parts of or create their own media. The interesting thing is that it works the other way as well. Media mogul Angel Gonzalez, who owns several television and radio stations in Guatemala, also allegedly gave significant campaign contributions to Baldetti's party and others as part of a quid pro quo between himself and the political elites to secure government contracts, favorably legislation and licenses, according to the same government investigation."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Officials Fear Increase in Violence After Gulf Cartel Leaders Death. Officials in the Mexican government fear an increase in violence in the northeastern border region, following the death of Gulf cartel leader Ezequiel Cardenas Guillen, alias Tony Tormenta, reported Mexico's El Nuevo Diario. After he was gunned down in a firefight with Mexican police, other drug trafficking organizations such as the rival Zetas may be emboldened to encroach on the Gulf cartel's operational territory in the region. Alejandro Poire, National Security spokesperson, stated in an interview that the government did in fact see a potential for increased violence. ""In the longer run, it does generate an instability among organized criminal groups,"" Poire said, ""but in the short term, it pulverizes them."" Ultimately, the spokesman classified Cardenas' death as a part of a broader strategy of organizational decapitation: ""The capacity to generate leadership is not infinite, and these organizations never remain perfectly intact after taking a hit of this magnitude.""

"As Nicaragua Violence Soars, Doubts About Those Responsible Disappear. Civilian protestors continue to be targeted in Nicaragua by police and government-backed paramilitaries as doubts disappear about who is behind the killings. Police and armed pro-government groups known as ""parapolice"" in Nicaragua killed at least 10 people during several clashes in various cities over the weekend amid the latest round of violence since protests against the administration of President Daniel Ortega began in April, according to La Prensa. The most documented of these assaults began July 13, when parapolice groups armed with high-powered weapons carried out a 15-hour attack on some 200 students and others trapped inside a church near the campus of the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Nicaragua - UNAN) in the capital Managua, Nicaraguan journalist Ismael Lopez, who was among those pinned down, reported for the BBC. Two students were killed and at least 10 others were injured in the siege before medical personnel could reach them the following morning. Over the next two days, parapolice groups deployed across the country to carry out several other coordinated attacks and targeted kidnappings. At least eight others -- including a 10-year-old girl -- were killed in these attacks while several others remain disappeared, according to La Prensa. The latest bloodshed comes after at least 20 individuals were killed July 8 by parapolice groups in western Carazo department. Since April 18, the Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights (Asociacion Nicaraguense Pro Derechos Humanos - ANDPH) has recorded at least 351 deaths, more than 2,000 injuries, nearly 330 kidnappings, hundreds of disappearances and the possible presence of clandestine graves. The Nicaraguan government has issued blanket denials about its responsibility, pointing the finger instead at ""terrorists"" who it says are targeting police. ""This is a country that knows how to overcome great tragedies,"" Ortega's wife and Vice President Rosario Murillo said in a statement issued by the government. ""We have grown in patience, prudence, wisdom and faith. We know that God is just and that evil cannot prevail over what is good. This is why the actions of a small group of terrorists will not prevail over the will of the vast majority of the people."" But the government is standing alone. Indeed, if there were doubts surrounding who is responsible for the hundreds of killings in Nicaragua in recent months, they have been completely washed away. In recent days, Human Rights Watch issued a statement condemning the government for its role in the killings and naming the top officials in the police who it says is responsible. Following a visit to Nicaragua in May, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) also wrote a report strongly criticizing the Nicaraguan government for "" the excessive and arbitrary use of police force, [and] the use of parapolice forces or shock groups with the acquiescence and tolerance of State authorities."" As InSight Crime previously reported , parapolice groups working in conjunction with the national police were thought to be the primary forces implicated in the killings. International observers have for months now denounced the use of parapolice groups and demanded that Ortega dismantle them in order to put an end to the repression. As the violence continues to escalate, there is a growing risk that these groups may soon become criminal organizations engaged in other illicit activities."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Mexico Journalists Face Violence From Both Officials and Crime Groups: Report. Mexico continues to be one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists, according to a new report that highlights how corrupt government officials as well as organized crime groups are responsible for the majority of threats and attacks against journalists. In a recently published report , press freedom organization Article 19 documents the high levels of aggression toward journalists in Mexico and emphasizes the role that the government plays in the persistence of these crimes. According to Article 19, Mexico is the most dangerous country in Latin America for journalists, with levels of violence comparable to countries at war. In fact, Mexico is second only to Syria as the country with the most journalists killed. Since the start of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's term in 2012, Article 19 has documented nearly 2,000 cases of aggression against journalists, including 41 murders and four disappearances. Each year has been more violent than the last, with violence against journalists reaching its highest point in two decades in 2017, when 507 cases of aggression against journalists, including 12 murders, were documented. Although organized crime groups have borne the brunt of blame for violence against journalists, Article 19 clarifies that a large share of the blame also lies with corrupt government officials. Of the 1,986 cases of aggression against journalists documented in the last five years, 8 percent are thought to have been committed by members of organized crime groups, while 48 percent are attributed to government officials at the local, state and federal levels. The report did not specify the actors suspected in the remainder of the cases. When it comes to targeted killings of journalists, Article 19 estimated in 2012 that 75 percent were likely committed by organized crime groups. But in 2017, the organization estimated that organized crime likely accounted for only 21.9 percent of all journalist murders, while government officials were likely responsible for 19.5 percent. Mirroring patterns of violence in Mexico more generally, attacks on journalists have spread to new areas of the country. In the early 2010s, aggression towards journalists was heavily concentrated in states with a strong presence of organized crime groups, such as Chihuahua, Guerrero and Sinaloa. However, these attacks are now more generalized across the country, taking hold even in states that were once relatively safe for journalists, such as Baja California Sur, San Luis Potosi, Guanajuato and Quintana Roo. While journalists covering crime, security and justice issues were previously the most at risk of violence, those writing about corruption and politics are increasingly under threat, particularly in the capital Mexico City. Attacks against women journalists in particular are also on the rise. During former President Felipe Calderon Hinojosa's 2006 to 2012 term, an average of 32 women journalists were attacked each year for a total of 192. Throughout Pena Nieto's term, an average of 86.7 women journalists have been attacked annually. While organized crime groups are often assumed to be the main perpetrators of violence against journalists in Mexico, Article 19's recent report highlights the role of the Mexican government in committing, condoning and ensuring impunity for these crimes. Violence is used to silence both the journalists targeted and those in whom it incites fear. The states of Veracruz, Tamaulipas, Oaxaca, Guerrero and Chihuahua are now dubbed ""zones of silence"" because targeted killings are increasingly fostering fear and leading to self censorship and at times mass displacement. For example, in Veracruz, which is considered the most dangerous state in Mexico for journalists, at least 30 journalists fled seeking safety following the 2012 murder of crime reporter Regina Martinez. The former governor of Veracruz from 2010 to 2016, Javier Duarte -- who has been jailed on charges of colluding with crime groups while he was in office -- once admonished journalists to "" behave "" if they wanted to stay safe. Like most crimes in Mexico, virtually every instance of attacks on journalists remains in impunity , and family members seeking justice often face revictimization and criminalization by government institutions. According to Article 19, Mexico's impunity rate of 99.6 percent for crimes against journalists is likely due to the fact that almost half of all cases of aggression towards journalists are allegedly committed by government officials who have no interest in improving the mechanisms for holding perpetrators to account. As the organization put it, ""Silence derived through violence is convenient for political power."""	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Narco-Mom Takes Charge of Tijuana Cartel. The capture of Tijuana Cartel leader Fernando Sanchez Arellano has left his mother in charge of the Mexican drug trafficking group, a change that could herald a shift towards semi-legal business operations and less violence. After the arrest of Fernando Sanchez Arellano , alias ""El Ingeniero,"" on June 23, his mother Enedina Arellano Felix, alias ""La Narcomami"" (the narco-mom), has been left in command of the Tijuana Cartel, reported 24 Horas. Enedina is the sister of the Arellano Felix brothers who originally headed the organization. With her former husband, Enedina allegedly ran several businesses -- including a chain of pharmacies and a real estate company -- used to launder the cartel's money. Sources cited in 24 Horas said Enedina oversaw the cartel's development from an extremely violent gang to a ""pseudo business,"" favoring alliances with other organizations , including Colombian drug traffickers, over violence. The Tijuana Cartel, also known as the Arellano Felix Organization, dominated the drug trade from the Tijuana area into California for close to 20 years. The organization also profited from taxing other criminal activity in the region, including contraband and human trafficking. The Tijuana Cartel suffered a series of blows between 2002 and 2008 as the Arellano Felix brothers were captured or assassinated one by one, causing a leadership vacuum that led to the division of the organization. One faction allied itself with the Beltran Leyva Organization while the other formed ties with the Sinaloa Cartel, leading to a violent turf war in Tijuana that began to die down in 2010 amid speculation Fernando Sanchez Arellano had reached an agreement with the Sinaloa Cartel. Although she has kept a lower profile than other cartel leaders, Enedina has been on the US Department of Treasury's list of drug traffickers since 2002. Given her previous role as the cartel's financial chief and reportedly less violent management style , her leadership could mark a shift in the organization's tactics. If speculation that the Sinaloa Cartel controls the Arellano Felix clan's operations proves true, however, the change in leadership will likely have only a minor impact on the organization's activities."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"35 Veracruz Police Arrested for Ties to Zetas. The Mexican Navy has arrested 35 Veracruz state police for alleged ties to the Zetas , in an indication of the government's reliance on federal troops in the face of corrupt local forces. Marines arrested 19 of officers in the city of Xalapa on September 22, and the other 16 at an airport in the state of San Luis Potosi, Excelsior reported. The arrests were ordered by the unit of the Attorney General's Office dedicated to organized crime. Veracruz Government Secretary Gerardo Buganza Salmeron said that the state would keep training new police officers under the Creditable State Police project, and that 1,600 had already graduated from the academy, reported Milenio. Buganza said that the arrests were carried out as part of the ongoing Operation Safe Veracruz. The Zetas took control of Veracruz in 2010 after splitting from the Gulf Cartel. However, in the last couple of years its dominance has been challenged by the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG), causing murders related to organized crime to increase four-fold in the first nine months of 2011. The authorities have taken drastic action in their efforts to clean up Veracruz's police. In October 2011, 980 officers, more than 10 percent of the state force, were fired after failing tests designed to root out corruption. At the time, state Security Secretary Arturo Bermudez Zurita said that the government was committed to creating a ""100 percent"" trustworthy state police force. There have also been problems with the municipal police. In December last year, the city of Veracruz fired its entire police force , made up of 800 agents and 300 administrative staff, replacing them with the marines. This, and the recent arrests by the marines, indicate how much the Mexican authorities are relying on federal forces to supplement and keep in check corrupt local police. In October last year, the government deployed federal troops to the state as part of Operation Safe Veracruz. The fact that it is still ongoing, and that police continue to be accused of ties to crime despite the government's promises, indicates that cleaning up Veracruz's security forces could be a long job.

"Mexico Prison Massacre Linked to Zetas Takeover Allegations. At least 13 people have died in a prison mutiny in north Mexico that some witnesses claim was a backlash against an attempted takeover of the prison by the Zetas, highlighting the criminal control and corruption that are pervasive in the penal system. Trouble at Cadereyta prison in the state of Nuevo Leon erupted when inmates took three guards hostage on October 10, reported AFP. The situation deteriorated into rioting, with around 250 inmates burning rubbish and mattresses and taking to the prison roof with banners denouncing alleged links between prison director Edgardo Aguilar Aranda and organized crime group the Zetas, reported EFE. Authorities confirmed that at least 13 inmates died in the clashes, with at least 8 more injured, two of them police officers. However, other reports suggest the number of injured stands at least as high as 25, while the number of dead could also rise. The authorities responded by sending in 60 police patrols to restore order and state Interior Secretary Manuel Gonzalez Flores to negotiate with the inmates, according to EFE. Gonzalez told media that the rioting broke out over prison conditions. However, family members of the inmates say prisoners took action over a plan by the prison director to bring in Zetas members to assert control over the prison, a claim supported by a banner strewn across a wall declaring ""We don't want a Z director,"" stated AFP. According to EFE's report, the prisoners behind the violence were connected to the Zetas' former parent organization and long-time enemies the Gulf Cartel. The incident is the second deadly prison riot of the year in Cadereyta, with four dying in disturbances in March. Mexico's prison system, like many in the region, is underfunded and overpopulated, a situation that has led to prisoners themselves controlling the insides of up to 60 percent of institutions, according to some experts. When prisoner rule is combined with rampant corruption, the conditions are ripe for organized crime to assert dominance, extorting inmates and controlling the flows of contraband. The Zetas in particular have proven adept at setting up internal criminal networks within prisons, most notably in the case of a penitentiary in the state of Coahuila, Piedras Negras. Investigations have revealed how the Zetas allegedly turned the prison into a base of operations. They used it to dispose of the corpses of an estimated 150 victims, and broke out over 130 inmates. They also manufactured uniforms, bulletproof vests, and modified cars inside the prison to hide drugs and weapons, all in complicity with state authorities. In another case, prison authorities at Gomez Palacio prison in Durango allegedly allowed Zetas inmates out of prison to carry out murders, including the massacre of 17 people in 2010. Former inmates speaking to Vice earlier this year detailed how Cadereyta has not previously been subjected to organized crime rule. However, following the protests in March, which were reportedly against new security measures, it is easy to see how striking a deal with the Zetas would be a tempting proposition for the prison director, allowing the authorities to bring new levels of control over unruly inmates, as well as providing riches to the corrupt officials that facilitate their activities."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Mexico Government Counts Almost 700 Kidnappings in 2011. The number of kidnappings and instances of violent crime reported in the first half of 2011 in Mexico has increased compared to 2010, according to recently released government statistics. Between January and June 2011 a total of 692 kidnappings were reported in Mexico, representing an increase of six percent from the same period last year, when 652 kidnappings were registered. According to Excelsior , the statistics were compiled by the Secretary General of National Public Safety, known by its acronym SESNSP. Homicide and robbery saw similar rises, while the only ""high impact"" crime that saw a drop in 2011 is extortion, the agency report says. The northwestern state of Chihuahua, where 87 kidnappings were reported in the first half of this year, is still regarded as the most insecure of Mexico's 32 states. The western state of Michoacan registered the country's second-highest kidnapping rate, with 70 cases reported so far this year. A study recently released to Mexico's lower house in Congress found that kidnappings have increased 317 percent since President Felipe Calderon took office. "	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Claims that El Salvador Street Gangs Control Drug Routes Remain Unfounded. Authorities in El Salvador have identified a number of international drug trafficking routes and warned of the increasing involvement of the country's street gangs in the drug trade, although similar concerns in the past have yet to be substantiated. In a press conference on June 30, El Salvador's Anti-narcotics Division (DAN) chief, Marco Tulio Lima, said Salvadoran gangs were ""mutating"" into ""narco-gangs."" He also stated that one of the international drug trafficking routes identified by the DAN -- from Ecuador to Guatemala -- is run by local gangs, reported La Prensa Grafica. Lima pointed to a growing percentage of drug related arrests involving local gang members as evidence for these claims. Whereas only 23.9 percent of those arrested last year on drug charges were gang members, a total of 898 gang members have been arrested for drug trafficking in the first six months of 2014 -- close to 45 percent of the total. So far this year, the DAN has identified at least 11 international drug trafficking routes passing through El Salvador, including routes from San Salvador's Monsenor Romero airport to the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Italy, Spain and Egypt. Additionally, the DAN discovered six routes for moving money during the same period, three of which are to Panama, two Colombia and one Ecuador. Warnings from Salvadoran authorities of the country's powerful street gangs -- such as the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 -- morphing into drug traffickers with links to international cartels are nothing new. In the past, however, fears about Salvadoran gangs becoming transnational drug trafficking organizations have proven largely unsubstantiated. In October 2012, when the US Treasury Department designated the MS13 as a transnational criminal organization, many law enforcement agents questioned this classification and several law enforcement officials told InSight Crime the gang did not have the capacity or contacts to be classified as transnational. A 2013 report identified collaboration between factions of the MS13 and Mexico's Zetas criminal group and stated that the gang had evolved from providing security for cocaine shipments to moving the shipments through El Salvador themselves. But the group did not appear to play a significant role beyond the country's borders. The growth in arrests of gang members on drug charges cited as evidence of their increasing role in drug trafficking is instead likely representative of the gangs taking over micro-trafficking networks and street level drug sales within El Salvador."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Cartel Lieutenants Capture Could Bring Tijuana a Step Closer to War. The arrest of Armando Villareal Heredia, alias ""El Gordo,"" is a blow to the weakened Tijuana Cartel that could increase the likelihood of conflict with the Sinaloa Cartel in the region. According to a 2010 U.S. indictment , Armando Villareal Heredia was a top-ranking lieutenant of the group, reporting to organization boss Fernando Sanchez Arellano, alias "" El Ingeniero ."" He operated from Guadalajara and was in charge of logistics for drug shipments from Mexico's Pacific coast to the border region of Baja California. Villareal Heredia was arrested on July 9, and is likely to face extradition to the United States given that he is a U.S. citizen, born in San Diego. At 33 years of age, Villareal Heredia represented the ""new generation"" of Tijuana Cartel leadership as depicted on a DEA wanted poster released in 2009. The group, also known as the Arellano Felix Organization, was referred to in the indictment as the Fernando Sanchez Organization or (FSO). This allowed federal prosecutors to claim victory over the AFO, whose first generation of leadership is now largely behind bars. The new generation of leaders has followed a much lower profile business model which attempts to avoid drawing attention through the excessive or public use of violence. Villareal Heredia gave instructions to Mario Escamilla, a San Diego gang ""underboss"" who organized courier drug trafficking and assassination operations for the capo operating from ""Zapopan/Guadalajara"" Jalisco. The indictment cites Villarreal for a number of crimes, including the theft of 50 pounds of methamphetamine being transported on a bus in Mexico. The indictment also refers to conversations, intercepted by the U.S. government, in which he apparently arranged the cross-border transport of small quantities of methamphetamine. The most damning charges against Villareal Heredia involve conversations between him and a government informant, in which he ordered the informant to kill an FSO member in the United States, who had ""disrespected"" the ""Senores in Tijuana,"" (the FSO leadership). Armando Villareal Heredia ""communicated directly"" with FSO boss Fernando Sanchez Arellano, according to the indictment, and thus his capture will be a significant blow to the group. It is another in a long string of arrests of top level FSO leadership which could weaken the cartel's control over the lucrative Tijuana ""plaza,"" or drug trafficking territory. It's not clear how far the group currently controls the Tijuana plaza, as InSight Crime has set out in previous investigations. The FSO has had an acrimonious relationship with Sinaloa Cartel's head Joaquin Guzman, alias ""El Chapo,"" since the Tijuana-based group became independent traffickers in the early 1990s. But with the arrest of the first generation of leadership of the AFO, the two groups have achieved some form of rapprochement. What is known about the new relationship is that the Sinaloa Cartel and the FSO have achieved a level of peace which has avoided the large scale homicides and widespread kidnappings seen in the civil war within the Tijuana Cartel from 2008-2010, when lieutenant Eduardo Teodoro Garcia Simental, alias ""El Teo,"" broke off from the group. Garcia Simental formed an alliance with the Sinaloa Cartel in 2008, but this had broken down by 2010. Since his arrest in January 2010, the Sinaloa Cartel has preferred peace with its rival. It is not known for certain how the balance of power now stands between the two groups, though some observers believe Sinaloa currently holds the upper hand. The Familia Michoacana is also a major presence in Tijuana, which they use to traffic methamphetamine, but is not considered a major controller of the plaza and likely pays ""piso,"" or taxes, to the FSO. Now that the Familia has split and many members have followed Servando Gomez, alias ""La Tuta,"" into his offshoot group the Cabelleros Templarios, the Familia's current status in Tijuana is not clear. It should also be noted that the Arellano Felix brothers of the first generation, (now all dead or arrested) hailed from Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state. Their connections in their home region may have provided a salve and an opportunity to build bridges with the Sinaloa Cartel leaders. The Sinaloa Cartel is also deeply involved in a conflict for Ciudad Juarez with the Juarez Cartel , also known as the Vicente Carillo Fuentes Organization, and its armed branch La Linea. The Sinaloa Cartel may prefer to avoid conflict on other fronts as long as this struggle continues. InSight Crime's interviews with Tijuana businessmen, who wished to remain anonymous due to security concerns, indicate that the fear in Tijuana is that if the Sinaloa Cartel continues to increase in power and the FSO continues to decline, at some point Sinaloa will attempt to eradicate its weaker rival, causing violence to surge in the city. The arrest of Villareal Heredia is another blow to the FSO that could help make that scenario a reality. However, the Sinaloa are unlikely to try to strike a death blow against the FSO so long as they remains embroiled in conflict in Juarez. Thus, Juarez's loss may be Tijuana's gain. "	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Crime, Conflict, Illegal Mining Fuel Ecuador Arms Trafficking. Illegal mining, Colombian armed criminal groups and common crime are the three main markets for Ecuador's illegal arms trade, according to authorities, as the black market continues to be a headache for both that country and its neighbor Colombia. During 2013 and the first three months of 2014, Ecuador's Armed Forces seized 4,530 illegal firearms, and 457,310 rounds of ammunition, reported El Comercio. An unnamed top police official told the newspaper that some of the weapons entering the country illegally come from the army stores of other countries, while others enter via Ecuadorean ports. According to the report, the distribution and sale of weapons on Ecuador's black market is largely managed by local illegal groups, which sell rifles for up to $5,000 each. Firearms, ammunition and explosives destined for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) are also trafficked into Colombia via clandestine routes along the border, according to police intelligence sources cited by El Comercio. In January, Ecuador made what was reportedly its largest ever seizure of arms destined for Colombian rebel groups, reported ANDES. In a more recent operation , Ecuadorean police seized handguns and high-caliber weapons belonging to 10 individuals suspected of involvement in assaulting armed vehicles used for money transfer and financial institutions. In 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, around 60 percent of the country's 2,097 registered murders were committed using a firearm. The main buyers of the illegal arms that move through Ecuador are believed to be the 29th and 48th fronts of the FARC's Southern Bloc, which are active along the shared border. In addition to getting cheap arms supplies , including explosives , from Ecuador, the Colombian rebels also use the neighboring territory as a weapons production center. Colombian criminal groups known as the BACRIM (from the Spanish abbreviation for ""criminal bands"") have also expanded their influence in Ecuador in recent years, and likely participate in the arms trade. If, as the police suggest, a main destination for arms is illegal mining in Ecuador, this raises the possibility that armed groups such as the guerrillas, the BACRIM or even homegrown organized crime groups are involved in these operations, which have been indentified near the Colombian border. As noted by the police, a common source of weapons is corrupt members of the security forces. The spokesperson laid the blame on foreign institutions, but there have also been cases of army members from Ecuador caught arms trafficking."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
The Year in Which Mexico Will No Longer Live in Danger. An alleged document containing targets for the incoming Mexican government outlines Enrique Pena Nieto's goal of reducing the country's homicide rates by 50 percent in his first year, a target which analyst Alejandro Hope notes will be extraordinarily difficult to achieve. Reforma newspaper published an article a few days ago discussing a document supposedly produced by Enrique Pena Nieto's (EPN) transition team. According to the article, the document told the same old story, proposing the target of a 50 percent drop in the number of homicides and a 30 percent drop in the number of kidnappings during the first year of government (it seems like this is based on numbers from 2011). I haven't seen the document, only the articles that highlight it. Given the degree of generality in the listed proposals, it looks like a working document. Even still, it is surprising that the transition team is thinking about committing to such an ambitious reduction in violence. The goal is laudable, but is it possible that violent crime rates could improve so much in so short a time? It's possible. It's also extraordinarily difficult. A few numbers illustrate the complexity of the task: According to the article, EPN's team proposes reducing the homicide rate from 24 to 12 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2013. This suggests they are using [government statistical agency] INEGI's mortality statistics. Let's do the calculations based on this. Taking demographic change into account, a rate of 12 per 100,000 will equal approximately 13,800 intentional homicides in 2013. According to INEGI, in 2011 there were 27,199 homicides. Given current trends (using Executive Secretary of the National System for Public Security (SESNSP) numbers as reference), this year will see some 25,000, an average of 2,083 homicides per month. To reach the proposed target, the monthly average will have to drop to 1,150, a level not seen since 2008. Let me put it another way: the difference between the monthly average is equivalent to all the homicides committed in Michoacan in the past year. That is to say, reaching the goal would be equivalent to erasing a Michoacan every month. Things get trickier when considering that, no matter what they are thinking about doing, the results aren't going to be seen immediately. A couple of months will pass while the new officials take office, come into agreement over a new strategy and get it off the ground. Let's say three months to be optimistic. We will assume that in January and February there will be inert results (some 1,800 homicides per month), but March will already see the effects of the new measures (whatever they may be). Afterwards, the average monthly number of homicides will need to be 1,020 after March. This is equivalent to erasing a Federal District every month. Now, this doesn't mean the goal is totally unreachable. In individual cities, there are examples of accelerated drops in violence. We don't have to go very far to find them: Tijuana , just like Ciudad Juarez , both experienced an 80 percent reduction in the number of homicides in two years. But nationwide, the examples are scarcer. Dropping homicide rates by 50 percent took four years in Colombia (and at the time was considered almost miraculous). In the United States, it took 19 years (1991 to 2010) to achieve a similar reduction. The few cases which occur to me, for the most part, are countries that entered a peace process after a civil war ( Iraq , Bosnia). I don't think they're much of a guide for how this can be achieved in Mexico. The only relevant case which occurs to me is El Salvador. As I've commented in previous posts, the Salvadoran government , along with the Catholic Church and a few legislators, managed to establish a truce last March between the two principal gangs or maras: Mara Salvatrucha ( MS-13 ) and Barrio 18. The arrangement required a non-trivial concession from the government: the main mara leaders were transferred from a high security prison to a normal prison. Nevertheless, the results have been notable: the daily average of homicides dropped 60 percent in the first two months that followed the beginning of the truce, and these low levels have been maintained since then. This doesn't mean that the only way to rapidly reduce violence is to start negotiating with criminal gangs. Nevertheless, it does imply that if dramatic results are wanted, probably non-conventional measures are needed, in which the impact doesn't require long periods of maturation. Unfortunately, nothing listed by Reforma as possible measures of the Pena Nieto administration approach this definition. There is talk of creating a national gendarmerie , doubling the number of elite troops in the Federal Police, creating a scientific police force, deploying patrols and modern surveillance teams to the federal highways, and establishing emergency and immediate response systems in the states. These ideas could be very good, but they have a basic defect in terms of the proposed objective: none of them can be done in the short term. Establishing a working gendarmerie, for example, would require several legislative changes, rules and manuals of operations, the purchasing of uniforms and equipment, authorization of installations, etc. All of this will take several months, optimistically. Consequently, the impact of this new force on crime rates during the government's first year will be, in all probability, close to zero (and this is obviating the small inconvenience that, as described in the Reforma article, the gendarmerie will be made up of military personnel already involved in the fight against organized crime. So there will be the same number of elements, doing more or less the same thing, probably in the same places, but with a different uniform. Unless the new uniform is magical, I don't understand why the results would be very different from the current ones). The rest of the list is hardly mold breaking. There is nothing there that could cause a dramatic drop in criminal violence levels during the first twelve months of the government. As mentioned before, it's possibly that the document highlighted by Reforma is no more than a working document with a few preliminary ideas. Maybe some short-term proposals will be included in later documents. We can hope: the country will breathe easier if the goal is met and bodies are no longer piling up with the speed of recent years. But you can be sure this won't be achieved by magic. If the strategy of today, with a few adjustments, continues, the results are going to be like today's, with a few adjustments. It will be that easy and that inevitable.

"Hunting Drug Planes in Perus Jungles. In an examination of Peru's drug flights, IDL Reporteros Director Gustavo Gorriti takes an in-depth look at how trafficking by air is organized, how lacking resources hamper authorities' efforts to combat the phenomenon and how regional cooperation is helping to fill the technology gap. Where can you see unidentified flying objects? That depends. If you are looking for the ones that supposedly took off from Ganymede, the place is (or rather, was) Peru's Chilca desert. Good luck. But if you are not hoping for anything more than to see unidentified flying planes that come, rather modestly, from Bolivia, the results will not be esoteric, but they are guaranteed. Neither in Pichis Palcazu nor in the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valleys (VRAEM) can you miss it. You will hear them flying and you will see them flying, the lords of the sky, sometimes alone but more often in pairs and even in fleets of four or five planes. If the observer is in possession of a radio scanner, he or she can enrich this experience by listening to the conversations of the pilots, who speak with an unmistakable Bolivian accent, to the people who are waiting for them below. Where do I land? Here, or in the next one? Are there ""ventiladores"" (""fans"" - code for security force helicopters) nearby? This article originally appeared in IDL Reporteros , and was translated and reproduced with permission. See the Spanish original here. The VRAEM and Pichis Palcazu are now among the most intensely trafficked air corridors in Peru. The difference with other regions is that in both of these, virtually all of the flights are illegal and all have the objective of carrying coca paste (300 kilos per flight) to processing laboratories in Bolivia where, without losing any of this weight, it will be converted into cocaine hydrochloride. The frequency of the flights has increased in intensity since last year, when some police intelligence reports registered around 30 flights flying over barracks or police precincts over five or six days, in just one part of the VRAEM. Now, they calculate that there are between three and six flights daily in just the Valley, and slightly less in Pichis Palcazu. The increase in flights, which in a few months has significantly changed the form in which drug trafficking operates in the region, has been possible for a paradoxical reason: the VRAEM, the region with the highest concentration of security force operatives in the country (police and armed forces), has a totally unprotected air space. The pilots, who are almost always Bolivian, have nothing to fear as long as they are in the air. They can fly over, and they do fly over, barracks, precincts, posts and bases, before undertaking the only uncertain and dangerous part of their journey: landing on one of the various closely positioned runways (most of which are not far from the military bases - see IDL Reporteros map). These are chosen at the last moment by the group waiting for them below, in order to prevent ambushes on land and to load the 300 kilos of drugs with which the plane will return to Bolivia as quickly as possible. How can doves be hunted without hawks, shotguns, or even slingshots? By trapping them when they are on the ground. For Peru's anti-drug police, an impotent bystander in the face of the untouchable drug flights, the only way to hunt them has been in the few vulnerable moments when the planes descend, taxi, open their doors while the land-based drug traffickers approach with their load and stack it neatly in the plane before the pilot closes the cabin, head toward the end of runway, pick up speed, and take off on the return flight. Those are the most dangerous moments for the drug traffickers. They end disastrously when the narcos suddenly hear the shouts and gunshots that announce a police ambush, and the police contingent that managed to hide in the thicket and awaited the right moment to act emerges. When that happens, the possibilities of escape for the narcos are next to none. Nonetheless, sometimes they try, and fail. For this reason, the local drug traffickers try to be unpredictable and to carefully examine the areas surrounding the landing strips and the access roads. In addition, they frequently receive information from locals, who benefit from their presence. For the police, this makes it very difficult to plan, organize and execute a successful ambush of the drug planes. Nonetheless, they have managed to do it on various occasions. There is another way to capture drug planes: when they land badly, or on a badly prepared clandestine airstrip, they crash, and the plane cannot take off again. Sometimes they burn, and sometimes, when the damage is reparable, they are hidden, but on other occasions the police seize them. How worthwhile is nabbing four or five luckless planes among hundreds of successful flights? Very worthwhile, to tell the truth. For the anti-drug police, especially the intelligence units, each plane captured is an information treasure trove, a fascinating tale that allows them to discover how the drug traffickers operate, who they are and what their methods are. The Old Man Who Couldn't Flee Slightly before 12:45 on December 11 last year, the plane CP-2683 landed on a clandestine runway situated in the Codo del Pozuzo jungle. Minutes later, among threatening shouts and gunshots, the whirlwind police ambush unfurled. The pilot did not try to take off, as his reckless Bolivian comrades -- for whom being a pilot is frequently associated with accidents and fatality -- perhaps would have. This one had sufficient experience to know that, whatever he did, the game was over. The 63-year-old Brazilian pilot, Carlos Alberto Paschoalin, had various years of experience, the majority of them dedicated to drug trafficking. Nearly all of his flights had been successful, but there had been occasions in which this was not the case, and the documentation of these failures left an interesting stamp on an uncommon biography. Fifteen years earlier, on October 25, 1999, Paschoalin was captured by the Brazilian police in another landing area, at the Valle de Gorgulho ranch in the state of Para, while he was piloting a twin-engine plane (PT-VKJ) with 849 kilos of cocaine on board. Although he was included in a federal process in Para (Ndeg 99390113678), all evidence indicates that he did not spend much time in prison, because he was sentenced, as a free man, on July 11 last year to three years in prison -- a sentence which was immediately appealed. Thus, in liberty, the old pilot decided to make one more flight, to the Codo del Pozuzo. Each flight represents, according to police information, a payment of $25,000 for the pilot that successfully completes the mission of exporting the drugs. For Paschoalin, now being held in Piedras Gordas, the Pozuzo flight could have easily been his last job as a narco-pilot. Although he is a veteran of many drug transport flights, it is most likely that Paschoalin will not write about his memories, which would be fascinating, while jailed in Piedras Gordas, but rather, will quietly grow old inside the prison. In certain lines of work, silence is considered the best form of expression. Spanglish or Portunol? For the special intelligence units of the Peruvian anti-drug police, the resurgence of the narco-flights created new operational and investigative challenges. Throughout nearly the entire history of the so-called ""war on drugs,"" the path of drug trafficking pointed from south to north -- from the jungles of the Upper Huallaga Valley and from Chapare, in Bolivia, to the cities of the United States. Anti-drug cooperation primarily involved agreements with the US government. It was -- and continues to be -- a cooperation that is highly subsidized by the ""gringos,"" which signifies receiving the means (from helicopters to money for investigations and the use of electronic intelligence equipment) in exchange for ceding control over investigations and a degree of sovereignty in managing and carrying out operations. The police that worked, and continue to work, in joint operations with US forces, for example, are all polygraphed by officials from that country. The United States controls the use of the helicopters they provide to Peruvian police. The anti-drug bases, also subsidized by the gringos, have employees who audit the use of the helicopters based on what has been established in the contracts. In the majority of cases, the preferred use of the helicopters is for the eradication of coca plantations and not for other types of interventions, although they can also have a direct importance in anti-drug operations. It is a clearly dependent relationship that involves an uncomfortable degree of subordination (from what I know, it has not occurred to anyone to suggest a Brazilian style agreement here), but which undoubtedly has certain advantages. The polygraph has served, despite the abuses and shortcomings, to maintain the operative units relatively free of corruption. The electronic intelligence apparatuses, such as legal phone wiretaps, have been greatly useful in investigative work both against drug trafficking and against the Shining Path guerrillas. But the new air bridge does not, according to anti-drug sources, fall into the gringos' sphere of interest. The main reason is that the flights are not headed north, but rather, south, to Bolivia, and then to Brazil. The anti-drug police units who took up the fight against this new and very threatening phenomenon were primarily intelligence agents. Without being able to count on the support the United States could have provided, they had to look for other kinds of international police cooperation in a battle they cannot undertake alone. It helped them that, for at least the past few years, cooperation between the DIRANDRO (the anti-drug police) and the Brazilian national police had markedly increased. Trained under the same model as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Brazilian federal police developed a rapidly growing cooperative relationship with the DIRANDRO, in much more horizontal terms -- more ""south-south"" -- than that with the United States. It also meant less technology and resources, though not less ambitions. The DIRANDRO's special intelligence units also established collaborative contact with their Bolivian anti-drug counterparts, the FELCN. And, facing a lack of latest generation technology, they looked to apply the classic art of a good investigation in this tripartite alliance: obtain, analyze and process the pertinent information in the most accurate and opportune manner possible. Clues, traces, and personal information helped them answer questions such as: what is the history of the drug trafficking planes and their pilots? For most police, this was and still is a question without an answer. Day after day they see the planes flying high in the sky over the VRAEM and Pichis Palcazu. Sometimes, they take a snapshot with a cell phone camera from their barracks or a military or police base, when the flights come very close. But they arrive and depart from what seems to be an information gray area that they have not managed to crack open. But the DIRANDRO investigators managed to get some clear and valuable information from inside that haze. For example, the airplane CP-2782 told a story that was as eloquent as it was silent. On October 18 last year, CP-2782 was found in a clandestine landing area. It was parked in the middle of the runway, covered by leaves and weeds in a somewhat clumsy attempt to camouflage it, and its rear undercarriage was torn. The plane was a Cessna model C-206. It had been purchased some months earlier, that past February, in Miami, and was flown from there to Bolivia via Manaus, in Brazil. That city is one of the mandatory stopover points for planes headed to Bolivia. There have been around 900 planes that have reached Bolivia from the United States -- the majority via Manaus. No less than that. In Bolivia, the airplane was registered with the plates CP-2782. Its flights within that country were legal. Its final trip, which would end in an accident on the clandestine landing strip in Ayacucho, began legally, with an official flight plan to Bolivia. As a destination, the plan had marked the Maravilla airport in the Beni province. That airport had also been declared a destination point for other flights that ended up in Peru. Airplane Number CP-1800 On November 24 last year, the Bolivian plane CP-1800 landed on a clandestine airstrip in Pichis Palcazu, where it was awaited by a hidden contingent of special operations police. There was no surrender, but rather, a shootout in which the pilot, Angel Roca, was gravely injured, and died shortly thereafter. Along with him, police captured two other people and seized various firearms, satellite phones, VHF radios and two GPS systems. And 300 kilos of cocaine, which had apparently already been stowed away and was ready for takeoff. Angel Roca, the pilot who was killed, had a long criminal record. His first registered arrest took place in August 1993, in a joint operation between the Bolivian rural patrol unit UMOPAR and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which at the time had a strong presence in Bolivia. A total of 18 people were detained -- two Colombians and 16 Bolivians. Among these was Roca, who was in charge of the aerial transport of the drugs. Years later, in 2001, Roca was arrested in the state of Goiais in Brazil, and accused by the federal justice system of international cocaine trafficking and illegal arms possession. By 2013, however, he had regained his freedom, and was again involved in the aerial transport of cocaine. With this goal, he headed towards his destination, which turned out to be his final destination: the Peruvian jungle. Airplane Number CP-1959 The history of this plane was reconstructed based on the remains from a fire, seen for the first time from a helicopter flying over Pampa Hermosa, Puerto Inca, in Huanuco, on November 26 last year. The plane had been burned after, according to locals, an attempted landing ended in an irreparable accident. Not much remained, except for a piece of the tail with the Bolivian flag painted on it, and a scorched identification tag from the plane's manufacturer, where the serial number could be made out. Using this information, the FELCN in Bolivia was able to provide the registration information of the plane and its owner. It was the Cessna CP-1959, whose owner, Carlos Botero Barbery, had a police and court record for drug trafficking. He had been detained in December 2010 with cocaine and precursor chemicals. Apparently, he was back out of custody at the time his drug plane crashed on the clandestine landing strip in Huanuco. The Capture of the CP-1847 If the narco-pilots choose their landing point at the very end of the journey, after coordinating with the group on the ground, which is carrying the drugs and is in charge of security, how do the police manage to ambush the planes? With good intelligence. The landing strips have to be located close together, so that the groups on the ground can easily move from one to the other, without the plane having to spend much time on the ground. This is what happened with the group of police that, on March 29, captured the Bolivian airplane CP-1847 near the town of Santa Rosa. The plane was carrying 300 kilos of cocaine and was protected by an armed security contingent at the time the police operation was carried out. That time, the operation was a joint action by the DIRANDRO's special operations division in the VRAEM, reinforced by the tactical actions group of the same force, the not very euphonic but effective GOATJ. The contingent responsible for the operation was very small, in order to be able to successfully infiltrate the area with little risk of detection. The infiltration began, according to well-informed sources, on the night of March 26. During the following three days, the group concealed itself in the areas surrounding the landing strip that they believed would be used by the drug traffickers. At 10am on the 29th, the Bolivian airplane landed. As they came nearer, the operatives, without being discovered, saw a group of 10 people loading the plane with drugs. The intervention group sprang into action, and became engaged in a shootout with the men in charge of security for the flight. Minutes later, the situation was brought under control. Near the airplane, they found Ezequiel Guinea, who had been hit in the knee. In the plane was the Peruvian national Hugo Quiroz, and another person who was mortally wounded, the Bolivian national Julio Jimenez, who died shortly thereafter. In and around the plane, there were a number of bags of cocaine that brought the total to more than the 300 kilos of drugs that would have made up the complete load. After another short round of shooting, another helicopter arrived with reinforcements from the VRAEM Special Command. This allowed them to effectively secure the area and finish their legal tasks. What Is the Business? Why do the VRAEM narco-traffickers export washed coca paste to Bolivia, when in the recent past they had developed simplified methods to produce cocaine hydrochloride in the VRAEM itself? According to police intelligence sources, one of the reasons is the quality of the final product: in the VRAEM they use acetone to make the cocaine hydrochloride, while in Bolivia they commonly use ether for the same process. Moreover, the variety, price and quality of the precursor chemicals available in Bolivia are advantageous for the drug traffickers. A kilo of coca paste in the VRAEM costs $900. In Bolivia, this rises to $1500. This difference covers the basic costs of drug exportation, and explains the earnings: The rental cost of a clandestine airstrip fluctuates between $10,000 and $15,000 per flight. An experienced pilot makes $25,000 per flight. At the other end of the spectrum, a novice can make as little as $10,000. Training academies for pilots have proliferated in Santa Cruz: where once there was one, now there are seven. The price of the course has also multiplied by seven. The rental cost of the airplane for each narco-flight is around $70,000. When the airplane is about to take off from the VRAEM, its 300 kilo load of drugs is worth $270,000. When it lands, hours later, in Bolivia, the same load is worth $450,000. In addition to the individual flights, authorities have registered various cases of fleets of four or five planes that approach the clandestine landing strips in the VRAEM at the same time. One interesting case illustrates the combination of caution and recklessness with which the Bolivian narco-pilots approach their most dangerous point in the journey. A fleet of four planes nears the landing strips designated to be used to pick up the drugs in the VRAEM. The pilots speak amongst themselves using the pseudonyms Cris, Primo, Bigote and Uri. Cris tells Primo that he is not going to land, but rather, is turning around because the people on the ground have told him ""The Law"" is there. Uri says that he is turning back as well, since they have also told him ""The Law"" is waiting below. The conversation continues among the four men to determine where the ""ventiladores"" (security force helicopters) are. When they are certain they have seen them nearby, above a river, the four men decide to go back. But, despite the notably professional work of the anti-drug police's intelligence teams, which have successfully used the limited information from previous captures to investigate and reveal a good part of the drug trafficking organizations' structure, methods and routes, the reality is that the numbers are still overwhelmingly in favor of the drug traffickers. Just a dozen flights have been captured on land, after being ambushed or suffering accidents. It is possible that there are various other cases of accidents that have not been reported. Every day between three and six narco-flights reach Bolivia just from the VRAEM. This means more than 20 per week, and more than 80 per month. The number could be greater, or it could be less, but it is evident that the interdiction that occurs is minimal, meaning that the cost is more than acceptable for the drug traffickers and absolutely unacceptable for Peru.

"Are Police-Run Militias Spreading Across Brazil?Warnings that militias made up of police may have been responsible for dozens of murders during recent police strikes in Bahia, north Brazil, draw attention to the spread of these illegal groups beyond Rio de Janeiro. State police in Bahia went on strike in February to demand better pay. At least 3,000 officers joined in, initiating a 12-day stand off with federal forces, who began policing the streets. Some 181 people were killed in greater Salvador, the state's capital, in the ensuing chaos, which is more than double the city's murder rate for the same period in January. A disturbing pattern emerged in the killings: some 45 of the victims were bound and shot in the head with high-caliber weapons. Despite recent assurances to the contrary by the state's public security secretary, an official from the state's civil police, the investigative arm of law enforcement, suggested militias could have taken advantage of the strike to kill with impunity. The civil police has opened an inquiry into the issue of militias in Bahia. A widely-cited 2011 report by Rio newspaper O Globo * identifies Bahia as having one of the most serious problems with militias, who control 12 neighborhoods of Salvador. According to the*O Globo report, the Salvador militias ""exploit alternative forms of transportation and the distribution of Internet, cable television, and gas services. The modus operandi is similar to Rio's paramilitary groups."" The vast majority of coverage of Brazilian militias deals with Rio de Janeiro. However, the Bahia police strike has drawn attention to militias elsewhere in the country, with some reports suggesting that militias are spreading throughout Brazil.*The O Globo report found that militias -- ""paramilitary groups armed and led by public agents of the security forces"" -- are present in 11 of Brazil's 27 states. This trend mirrors shifts in patterns of violence in the country, with crime rates falling in Sao Paulo and Rio, the historical centers of crime, and rising in traditionally more peaceful places, according to a 2012 study by Sao Paulo think tank the Sangari Institute. Many of the states mentioned in O Globo's report saw huge jumps in homicide rates between 2000 and 2010. These included Bahia, which saw a rise of 300 percent, Para with 252 percent, Alagoas with 160, Paraiba with 150, and Piaui, Minas Gerias and Ceara all with more than 60. In this same period, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo's homicide rates dropped 57 and 80 percent, respectively. While militias will not be the only driver of the rise in violence in the states listed in the report, these illegal groups are known to be responsible for a high percentage of murders in cities where they have a presence. One recent report found that militias were responsible for more homicides in Rio than any other category, for example drug trafficking, or crimes of passion. A large part of the falling murder rates in Rio and Sao Paulo is connected to security drives against militias -- Rio authorities have cracked down on corrupt police as well as drug traffickers, arresting more than 600 in the last five years for suspected ties to militias. Rio was the birthplace of innovative policing models like the Police Special Operations Battalion and the Pacifying Police Units (UPPs). Another factor that may be important is pay rates for police. Sao Paulo, Brazil's wealthiest state, gave its police a 30 percent pay hike in 2011, which could play a part in discouraging them from illegal activity. Bahia, on the other hand, has not promised a comparable payhike. With the exception of Pernambuco, those states with large increases in violence in the 2000s were those with lower levels of wealth. While Brazil's richest cities saw improvements in safety, its poorest saw homicide rates rise. Poverty is clearly a major driver of all types of violent crime, but could also spur militias by driving down police morale, with meagre salaries pushing those in poorer states to join militias. While these militias likely do not form national networks (their money-making operations appear to be concentrated at the local level), they share common traits like a focus on extortion, and ties to the security forces. There is some evidence of militia groups being active outside their home cities. In 2011 a man who testified against militias in Rio De Janeiro survived an attempt on his life in Minas Gerais, some 200 kilometers away. Due to militias' infiltration of law enforcement, cracking down on them presents big challenges across the country. Superior Court official Eliana Calmon said corrupt police could be responsible for the bulk of violence against judges in Brazil. Judge Patricia Acioli, a longtime opponent of Rio militias, was gunned down outside her home in August last year. While at least two dozen policemen have been arrested in connection with the incident, this brutal killing serves as a warning for judges -- and others -- willing to challenge militias.

Peru Sets Record Coca Eradication Target for 2014. The Peruvian government has set a target of 30,000 hectares of coca crops to be eradicated in 2014, a more than 30 percent increase on the record eradication registered in 2013, perhaps hoping to lose its recently acquired position as the world's number one cocaine producer. The target was announced on January 4 by the government's National Commission for Development and Life without Drugs (Devida) and follows the eradication of 23,600 hectares of coca crops in 2013 -- exceeding the 2013 target of 18,000 hectares by more than 30 percent, reported Los Tiempos. Much of the success seen in 2013 came as a result of large-scale eradication in the Upper Huallaga Valley, a key coca growing region. However, in announcing the new 2014 target, Devida's president Carmen Mesias acknowledged that it could only be achieved by entering the VRAEM , the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valleys, an inhospitable collection of river basins which is the last remaining stronghold of the country's Shining Path guerrilla insurgency. Peru is now the world's primary producer of coca and cocaine , something Peruvian President Ollanta Humala may be seeking to redress through such ambitious targets. His government -- which came to power in mid-2011 -- initially received strong criticism for its poor performance fighting drug production, with Humala's original drug czar, Ricardo Soberon, attracting criticism from US officials for halting eradication efforts, until he was removed in January 2012. Humala's government has since won praise for its aggressive eradication efforts , which have been boosted by the apparent demise of the Shining Path in the Upper Huallaga Valley, allowing more effective government efforts in the area. Overseeing eradication in the VRAEM poses a more significant challenge, with the Shining Path faction exercising considerable control over cultivation and trafficking. Peru does not allow aerial fumigation, as has been the mainstay of eradication in neighboring Colombia, placing manual eradicators at risk of attack from the guerrillas. Peru's outstanding eradication performance in 2013 came at the same time Colombia failed to hit its targets, after aerial fumigation was halted by guerrilla attacks. Nevertheless, Colombia still eradicated more than 70,000 hectares over the course of the year, meaning Peru will face an uphill challenge shaking off its status as the world's primary coca producer should Colombia begin aerial fumigation again.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Killings of Venezuela Security Forces On the Rise Amid Crisis. A bloodstained weekend marked the latest chapter in a year of increased violence against Venezuela's security forces, a trend that is expected to continue as the country's political and economic crisis deepens. According to Venezuela's Foundation for Due Process (Fundacion para el Debido Proceso - Fundepro ), 163 police officers, military officials and bodyguards were killed during the first five months of 2016, a 14 percent increase from the same time period last year, reported El Nacional. Fundepro's study found that only 11 of the 163 killings have been resolved in court. In 80 percent of the cases, the attacker also stripped the security officer of his weapon. An unidentified source within Venezuela's investigative police force, the CICPC, told El Nacional that the officer's weapon was only recovered by authorities 3 percent of the time. This past weekend was a particularly violent one for the country's security forces. On Saturday, June 4, a group of assailants shot and killed a member of the Bolivarian National Guard (Guardia Nacional Bolivariana - GNB) while he was conducting a routine patrol in the northern state of Miranda. Two other officers were wounded, while one of the assailants was killed in the ensuing shootout. On Sunday, a group of police officers in Miranda were attacked after they arrived at a food distribution center that was being plundered by bandits. Although no officers were injured, the thieves reportedly made off with 25 tons of food. That same day, a group of individuals ganged up to beat with sticks a member of the CICPC homicide division, after the agent was reportedly seen committing a robbery at a gas station in Caracas. One of the agent's family members, who was allegedly involved in the robbery, was shot and killed. Earlier in the week, on June 2, a retired GNB officer in the state of Aragua was killed by six men wielding shotguns as he went to meet with local authorities. As the Fundepro study shows, the majority of assaults against police or military are rooted in attempts to rob the agents of their firearm. This suggests criminal gangs are behind a great deal of the attacks directed at security forces, since they need weapons to mete out violence and protect themselves from their rivals. But anecdotal evidence from this weekend, as well as from previous weeks and months , indicates the violence against security forces is becoming more generalized. If this is indeed the case, this trend is likely linked to Venezuela's worsening crises on the political, economic and security fronts. Amid runaway inflation, chronic food shortages and falling approval ratings , President Nicolas Maduro finds himself increasingly relying on the country's security forces to maintain some semblance of law and order. Last year the government launched a massive security offensive dubbed Operation Liberation of the People (OLP) to combat crime in the country, which regularly ranks as one of Latin America's most violent. The president has also stationed troops at supermarkets and food distribution points in an attempt to prevent looting. This is not only stretching police resources, but it also puts the security forces in more direct conflict with ordinary citizens who are growing restless as the lines lengthen and more food products disappear from the shelves. It's not just food that is running out. In late April, Maduro shortened the work week to two days for public sector employees in order to save on electricity. A shortage in medical supplies has also caused a public health emergency, with reports of infants dying in hospitals on a daily basis. The recent death of an 8-year-old boy diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, who had become the symbol of Venezuela's health care crisis, drew outrage across the country. Widespread corruption within the security forces, especially those stationed along the Colombian border, is another source of public frustration. During recent field research in the border area InSight Crime was told by a Colombian intelligence agent that members of Venezuela's National Guard are threatening to kill smugglers of gasoline and other contraband products if they do not agree to a pay a protection fee to the authorities. Covert networks of military officials, collectively known as the Cartel of the Suns , are also believed to be heavily involved in the country's lucrative cocaine trade. As public resentment builds against a corrupt force, acts of violence directed at the security forces -- such as the one last weekend against the CICPC agent -- could become more common. Venezuela's precarious political situation is another ominous indication that things could get worse for the security forces before they get better. The political opposition has collected 1.8 million signatures -- it only needed 200,000 -- petitioning the government to set up a referendum on whether to depose Maduro from power. Electoral authorities, however, have yet to approve the petition or set a date for the recall vote. As political scientist Ian Bremmer points out at Time Magazine , this delay could be a ploy to push the referendum into next year, when the vice president -- a party loyalist -- would automatically assume the presidency if Maduro gets ousted. So while Maduro is fighting for his political life, it appears his party is already scheming to stay in power until the official end of the president's term in 2019. The end may or may not be near for Maduro, but Venezuela's ongoing turmoil -- and the attendant violence against the country's security forces -- is unlikely to subside any time soon.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Plaza Publica: The Ghost of the Zetas. The state of siege had not yet ended and they had already returned. ""Did you hear a cardamom seller was killed? Well, it was them,"" said a civilian intelligence agent, who was waiting for me in Coban. The businessman was Boris Humberto Pinot, age 44. On the morning of February 17, he, who always participated in Coban's half marathon, was training on a runners' track in Jose Angel Rossi stadium, when two men showed up on a motorcycle. They made two circles around the track, and during the third circle they shot him, from less than a meter away. When the agent speaks of ""them,"" he means the Zetas. Are they really Zetas? I ask. ""The leaders are Mexican, three or four. They bring people they trust over from Mexico, and there are Guatemalans too, most of them Peones. But call them J's, M's, L's, whatever you want, they're still violent,"" explains the agent, selected by the security forces to track the movements of the group after the state of siege that started in December 19, and ended February 19. He didn't have to wait long. On February 25, a group of men arrived at a car shop, six kilometers outside of Coban. They opened fire for three minutes with their automatic weapons, and later set fire to five vehicles. The shop's security guard said it was strange how they yelled, ""We've arrived, you sons of bitches."" What does the murder of the businessman and the car shop burning have in common? ""Well, there's infomation that the businessman had problems with them because they wanted some of his land. The fire is more serious, but we're still not sure,"" said the agent. No Nightlife Everyone warns that the Zetas have returned. Walking around after eight o'clock at night gives the sensation of visiting a city in a coma: a small group of people eat meat tortillas in the corner of a park. Afterwards, nothing. Silence. ""Before it was lively. There were places openyou kept an eye on people on motorcycles, but not now,"" says a hotel employee. The Zetas came back. But no longer with their double traction vehicles or their guns with 30-round magazines or their Norteno ballads sung in tuneless voices and the pricey sound equipment in their cars set to maximum volume. Now they move in sedans. They try, in their own way, to go unnoticed. ""They're here,"" asserts a university professor, motioning his head in a semicircle. ""But they're no longer here with their money. They can no longer open up the businesses they bought out."" The nightlife in Coban is over. It left with them. Because they bought out those businesses, the professor says. ""Everybody knows it. I had one student who sold, and they killed him,"" he says. Finding someone who talks on the record about the Zetas is complicated in this place: not the police, not the mayor's office, not the universities, not the NGO's. Nobody. For five days, I heard phrases like these: ""But you can't use my name""; ""I'll deny that you talked to me""; ""I'll say that you lied""; and ""You could have my life in your hands, watch it."" ""There are three barsand they changed owners. And since the state of siege they've been shut down,"" says an independent journalist who used to frequent those places, places to celebrate life and relax like what happens anywhere else in the world. They were places that had life. ""There was a time when they wanted to pay for everything with Mexican pesos or U.S. dollars - can you believe it?"" says the journalist, who fled to the capital years ago looking for peace. For two nights I walked around these bars. I asked neighbors, and they said they didn't know if they'd be opening again soon. ""They came here. They asked me how much I wanted for the business. I said it wasn't for sale, and ha I almost had to beg them to let me stay because it was sell or they'd kill me. Finally, I had to serve them meals on the house whenever they wanted to eat,"" says a restaraunt owner. He says they offered him a million dollars in cash. ""That's how they bought land in Cahabon, Fray Bartolome de las Casas, Chisec, and Playa Grande, Quiche. They use the land for stores and training campsNot even the military goes in there,"" says someone who knew what information was being shared before it came out in WikiLeaks. The Ex-friends who Took over Coban ""They fled to Coban, they fled to Coban,"" the police repeated insistently by radio, the day in March 2008 when drug trafficker Juan Leon Ardon , alias ""Juacho Leon,"" was killed in Zacapa. That was the first time that the name ""Zetas"" was heard in the country. They'd been present in Guatemala since 2007, but under the name of the Gulf Cartel , according to the anti-drug prosecutor's office of the Public Ministry. In 2008, the Zetas began to split from the Gulf Cartel. The authorities had information that Juan Leon Ardon worked for the cartel. According to a cable sent from the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala, published by WikiLeaks, the accused drug trafficker Walter Overdick had his base in Alta Verapaz and invited the Zetas into the country to take over a drug trafficking route from northern Honduras to Mexico, passing through Izabal, Alta Verapaz, Quiche, and Peten. Leon Ardon was an ""obstacle"" for Overdick and the Zetas because he had contacts in Honduras and moved drugs via the route they wanted. That was why they killed him, according to the final accusation presented by the Public Ministry in the trial against six Mexicans and eight Guatemalans, who were sentenced last September to a combined 313 years in prison for the massacre. For months, the prosecutors asked, why would a drug trafficker (Juacho Leon) leave his fiefdom and turn himself in to this rivals? The answer, they found out, was that Juancho Leon already knew some of his killers. Some time ago they worked together, before the Zetas split from the Gulf Cartel. The way they betrayed Juancho Leon was how they betrayed Walter Overdick, after he invited them into Alta Verapaz. ""They kicked him out his farm, him and 'Loco' Turcios (Ottoniel Turcios),"" says the source, who'd also worked as an informant for the authorities. Loco Turcios was a drug trafficker who'd come into power after the arrest of Jorge Mario Paredes, alias ""El Gordo,"" who was sentenced to 31 years of prison in the U.S. ""Everything was going well until they started giving orders and killing here in Coban without discussing it. Drug dealers died who didn't want to sell to them, people who laundered money because they wanted to launder more [because they thought it was insufficient]. [They killed] innocent people who looked at them wrong or because of an altercation on the streetIt was chaos,"" the source explains. And, he adds: ""The government found out that even Overdick and Turcios were affected. And the cardamom businesses and the African palm. Because otherwise they would not get involved."" Too Late Investigations show that Guatemala is very important for the Zetas. The first who arrived to lead the group was Daniel Perez Rojas, alias ""El Cachetes,"" and Flavio Mendez Santiago, alias ""El Amarillo."" The two are part of the first group of Zetas in Mexico and both were bodyguards for the top leader of the Gulf Cartel, Osiel Cardenas Guillen, arrested in 2003 and extradited to the U.S. in 2007. They were hard guys. When Cachetes was captured the Zetas sent in new people. Among them, Raymundo Almanza Morales, alias ""Ray"" or ""Commander Gori."" He was arrested May 2009 in Monterrey. Now, according to authorities, the leader of the group is Miguel Trevino Morales , alias ""Z-40,"" the second-in-command of the Zetas in Mexico. The Zeta Corridor According to the investigation by the Prosecutor General and information from Guatemalan intelligence, the Zetas achieved almost absolute control of drug trafficking from nothern Honduras and Guatemalan's Caribbean coast. Meanwhile, they started a war in Chiquimula and Huehuetenango to control drug shipments. Documents found in safehouses indicate that control of the drug route began in the city of Tela, Honduras. A list was found of collaborators and their respective jobs. Also found was receipts for boatmen for up to $12,000, for picking up the drugs at sea and transferring them to stores. There are also stores in the city of Omoa, where the director of the group is a man called ""Zelaya"" with the phone number (504) 95316157. The shipments are transferred by land to Izabal. Some use boats to take the drugs into Guatemala via Estor municipality, and afterwards by the Cahabon river. That is why it's important for the Zetas to take control of Izabal and most of all Alta Verapaz, the natural distribution point. From here drugs can be sent to Peten, Quiche o Huehuetenango. Depending on the difficulty. The principal contact in Mexico was identified as Margarito Mendoza Lopez, who is identified in notebooks and archives as ""Z-50"" and is based in Palenque. He was arrested last year for transporting weaponry. A Circular Business According to data found in a safehouse (notebooks keeping track of drug shipments and sales) between February and September 2009 one Zetas cell managed at least $110 million (some 880 million quetzales). The shipments arrived to Izabal from Honduras and left to Mexico moving through Sayaxche and Playa Grande, Quiche. Some 8,000 kilos of cocaine was transported and an unspecified amount of heroin. Each kilo of cocaine was valued at $12,200 and heroin, up to $17,500. There are also notes of purchases of AK-47 rifles at $1,900 and bulletproof jackes at $800. Grenades were bought at $200 each and explosives (TNT) at $450. The Alta Verapaz group is made up of 100 people.

"Spain Dismantles Collection Office Run by Colombians. A network of hired assassins led by three Colombians has been dismantled in Spain in what authorities called the biggest operation to be carried out against a ""collections office"" in that country. As part of an operation that began nine months earlier, Spanish police broke up a network of ""sicarios,"" or hired assassins, dedicated to collecting drug trafficking related debts. Those arrested included 15 Colombians and one Spaniard. The system the network used to settle debts was the ""amarre"" (tying up), or kidnapping, of the victim until they or a family member paid the amount owed, reported EFE. The group also extorted the victims, threatening to take action if they did not pay, including the kidnapping or murder of relatives of the victims who were often in Colombia. According to authorities, the killers usually worked by assignment, and charged the person who contracted them 50 percent of the money collected, although they also sometimes worked for themselves. The dismantled ""collections office"" or what is known in Colombian underworld lingo as a ""oficina de cobro"" -- a localized organization that controls debt collection and extortion and carries out assassinations -- was headed by men Spanish authorities called the Upegui brothers. In addition to performing kidnappings and extortion, the network was also involved in drug trafficking and, apparently, money laundering, according to Europa Press. Although Spanish authorities say this has been the biggest operation carried out against an ""oficina de cobro"" in that country, it is not the first time that an organization of this type has been dismantled in Spain, nor is it the first time that selective homicides related to drug trafficking debts have been committed. In March 2012, a network known as ""Los Senores del Acido"" (The Lords of Acid) was broken up, which worked as an assassin network in Madrid for the Colombian criminal group the Rastrojos. However, what is new in this case is that, unlike other Colombian organizations taken down in Spain, the Upegui brothers' network did not appear to work for any one organization in particular. This could be due to the growing fragmentation of criminal groups, which has allowed small criminal organizations to gain more autonomy and become involved in more of their own criminal activities."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Mexican Cartels Recruiting US Soldiers. Drug cartels in Mexico are recruiting US soldiers as hitmen, illustrating both the all too common overlap between organized crime and security forces, and the ongoing militarization of the drug trade. A new report by Fox News looks at three recent cases of US military personnel offering their services as contract killers and military trainers to Mexican cartels. On July 25th, 22-year-old army private Michael Apodaca received a life sentence in an El Paso court after he was found guilty of assassinating a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency informant in 2009 on behalf of the Juarez Cartel. The case follows the arrest of two other soldiers last year as part of a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sting operation. Kevin Corley and Samuel Walker offered DEA agents posing as members of the Zetas military training and arms stolen from the US army, and entered into negotiations to carry out assassinations and steal drug shipments. Late last year, Corley admitted to a range of charges, while Walker was found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire. The report also notes that the recent hit on a former Gulf Cartel lawyer in Southlake, Texas, raises suspicions of military involvement because of the professional military-style tactics used. Gang activity within the US military has been an issue for some time, although it is more frequently linked to US-based gangs, which have even reportedly enlisted members in the military specifically so they can receive, and later share, military training. The trend is reflected regionally, with the most famous example being Mexico's Zetas, whose founding members were from a Mexican Special Forces unit. The overlap between crime and security forces is not just limited to the military. In countries such as Honduras and Brazil, police are often contracted as hitmen by criminal groups looking to exploit their military training, or even operate as criminal gangs themselves. It is not a new phenomenon either. In Colombia, connections between security forces and organized crime groups have long been common, especially in the paramilitary movement and in the now defunct Norte Del Valle Cartel, whose original leadership was made up almost entirely of former security forces personnel.	0	1	0	1	0	0	0
"Mislabeled Meth Chemicals Smuggled into El Salvador. Smugglers in El Salvador are importing chemicals used to produce methamphetamine under different names, and using shell companies, posing a challenge to customs and law enforcement officials. On October 5, Salvadoran officials raided a warehouse registered to a fake company in Ciudad Merliot and seized 17 barrels of ethyl phenylacetate, a chemical used in the production of methamphetamine. La Prensa Grafica reports that the barrels had been part of a larger shipment which entered the country in October 2010 and were falsely identified as methyl salicylate, a compound commonly used to make ointments. The rest of the shipment, some 40 barrels, had already been sent to Guatemala by the time of the raid. Chief counternarcotics investigator Jorge Cortez told the paper that by disguising the true contents of the barrels, smugglers were able to pass the cargo off as legal and avoid official scrutiny. Normally, shipments of ethyl phenylacetate and other meth precursors are subject to strict controls and regulation. Prensa Grafica reported that, according to police, smugglers have been ""mislabeling"" chemical compounds in order to sneak meth precursors into the country for years, and there is little they can do to monitor it. An uptick in shipments of salicylic acid into the country from 2010 to 2011 (from 301 to 52,140 kilos) may have been due to precursor chemicals being mislabled as this product. El Salvador and neighboring Guatemala have struggled to improve security on their maritime borders, but corruption and a lack of resources make this extremely difficult. Drug trafficking networks have taken advantage of this, moving massive quantities of meth precursors into both countries and setting up ""import/export companies"" to serve as cover. The demand for precursors has grown particularly sharply in Guatemala, where groups like Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel are increasingly operating large-scale meth producing facilities. Much of this has to do with a crackdown on meth production and access to precursors in Mexico, which has caused groups to shift south."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Indicted Minister: Venezuela is Free of Drug Trafficking. Venezuela's new minister of Interior and Justice touted the country's drug interdiction bona fides just weeks after the US government announced he had been indicted on drug trafficking charges. Minister Nestor Luis Reverol said Venezuela was responsible for 4 percent of all drug seizures worldwide between 2008 and 2010, when he served as the country's top anti-drug official, reported Panorama. He added that Venezuela seized more drugs than any other country during that period. Reverol also said that the acquisition of special planes to intercept drug flights has enabled Venezuela to gain control over its air space and effectively end the illicit drug trade in the country. ""We are a country free of drug trafficking,"" Panorama quoted Reverol as saying. In early August, the US government unsealed an indictment against Reverol and one other Venezuelan official accusing them of protecting drug traffickers in exchange for bribes. The next day, President Nicolas Maduro promoted Reverol to Interior minister. Both Maduro and Reverol pointed to the country's supposed success in combating drug trafficking as evidence that the US allegations were false. ""How am I going to be a drug trafficker if I have spent 30 years fighting drug trafficking and searching for capos?"" Reverol said earlier this year in response to previous reports of a US indictment. The idea that Venezuela has eradicated drug trafficking flies in the face facts and reason. To be sure, the lack of official crime statistics, and transparency in general, has made it difficult for observers to assess the current security situation in Venezuela. But Reverol's claim -- which has also been peddled by other high-level Venezuelan officials recently -- smacks of a political agenda overshadowing honest appraisal of the facts. Contrary to the Interior minister's remarks, there is abundant evidence that drug traffickers with airplanes continue to use Venezuela as a launching pad for cocaine shipments to other parts of Latin America and Europe. In addition, cells of corrupt military officials known collectively as the ""Cartel of the Suns"" are heavily involved in the country's illicit drug trade. The US State Department has called Venezuela one of the top drug trafficking routes in the region because of its ""porous western border with Colombia , weak judicial system, sporadic international counternarcotics cooperation, and permissive and corrupt environment."" Reverol's unrealistic discourse is representative of Venezuela's growing isolation from the international community. An increasing number of high-level officials accused of drug trafficking by the US government have either remained in positions of power or have even been promoted. And the head of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, recently said the sentencing of political opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez marked the end of democracy in Venezuela."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Despite Colombia Accord, a New Rebel Threat Emerges. Colombia's ELN rebel group is reportedly moving in on territory abandoned by the FARC guerrillas as part of their peace deal with the government, drawing attention to an inconvenient truth: the ELN stands much to gain from continuing its armed struggle. In the remote region of Catatumbo and the mining town of Anori in the department of Antioquia, locals say rebel fighters continue to charge extortion fees, euphemistically known as ""vaccines."" But the uniforms, they say, have changed: the armbands worn by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) have been replaced by those of the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN). Similar reports have come from southern Cordoba department, which has long been a breeding ground for Colombia's various guerrilla and neo-paramilitary groups, but not the ELN. Instead of extortion, locals say the ELN is offering to buy up farmers' supply of coca leaves at a higher price than was paid by the FARC. These actions signal the ELN's attempt to stake its claim on the criminal booty that the FARC is presumably abandoning as part of its peace agreement with the government, which was announced in August and is scheduled to be signed in late September. The ELN has also bolstered its presence in the coca-rich town of Tumaco, Narino, from just 30 men to over 100, according to Colombia's Attorney General's Office. The area has traditionally been under control of the FARC's Daniel Aldana column, which has deep links to the illicit drug trade. Furthermore, indigenous leaders reported earlier this year that the ELN has already occupied FARC territory in the departments of Valle del Cauca, Cauca and Choco, a presence also noted by intelligence sources. In addition to its incursions into FARC territory, the ELN is showing off its military strength. The rebel group i s currently carrying out a 72-hour armed strike that went into effect on September 12 in six departments of Colombia: Arauca, Boyaca, Casanare, Norte de Santander, Santander and Vichada. The strike marks the 36th anniversary of the Domingo Lain Front, the ELN's most formidable fighting force that counts 500 soldiers and 1,500 militias in its ranks. As a result of the strike, the governor of Arauca temporarily shut down the school system there, businesses closed their doors, and the public transportation system was paralyzed. One police officer was injured by an explosive device. Less than a month prior to the strike, the ELN kidnapped four rice farmers in Arauca. Two of the hostages, who were reportedly being held in Venezuela, have since been freed. Colombia is on the verge of ending over 50 years of armed conflict with the FARC. But the possibility of the ELN reaching a negotiated agreement with the government appears to be as remote as ever. The two sides were engaged in preliminary peace talks for almost two years before announcing this past March they were ready to begin formal negotiations. But the talks have yet to get off the ground in part because the ELN has refused to renounce kidnapping , a precondition for negotiations set by the government. Perhaps an even more important motivating factor for the ELN to continue its insurgency is the potential financial and territorial windfall the group could see following a FARC demobilization. According to Ariel Avila, an investigator at Fundacion Paz y Reconciliacion , the ELN are only present in 99 of Colombia's more than 1,100 municipalities; the FARC have a presence in 242, or more than double that of their rebel cousins. The FARC also control up to 70 percent of all the coca grown in the country, while the ELN's role -- and profits -- in the illicit drug trade are much smaller. It comes as no surprise then that the ELN and neo-paramilitary groups known as ""bandas criminales,"" or BACRIM, are all looking to appropriate this valuable criminal real estate. Another potential gain for the ELN is in personnel and criminal know-how; in southern Cordoba, for instance, local authorities and military officials suspect that the supposed ELN presence is actually due to FARC members who have switched sides, or at least uniforms. ""I do not believe that [the FARC] have left so quickly, and I'm afraid that what is happening is that some have changed armbands,"" said a mayor in the region. Likewise, the ELN fighters who appeared in Anori reportedly already knew how much to charge each of their extortion victims, an indication the hand-over of responsibilities from the FARC to the ELN had been planned. Finally, the ELN leadership structure is not unanimously in favor of peace talks. InSight Crime field research found that the newest member of the ELN's Central Command (Comando Central - COCE), Gustavo Anibal Giraldo Quinchia, alias ""Pablito,"" is opposed to negotiations under the current conditions. There even seems to be division over the COCE's stance towards the October 2 national referendum on the FARC's peace agreement. In an August 26 open letter to the FARC, the ELN's top commander, Nicolas Rodriguez Bautista, alias ""Gabino,"" wished ""the best successes"" to the rebel group as it prepares to exit the conflict. But community leaders in Arauca who are campaigning for the agreement to be approved have reported coming under pressure from the ELN leaders in the area. ""Gabino may have said that they are not going to involve themselves in the process, but here, until 'Pablito' speaks, nothing is set in stone,"" one community leader told Colombian media outlet La Silla Vacia. The FARC peace agreement is an historic achievement for Colombia, and the de-escalation of the conflict with the country's principal rebel group has already saved thousands of lives. But the forces conspiring to keep the ELN on the battlefield and away from the negotiating table ensure the armed conflict will outlive the FARC's looming demobilization. And as before, the violence will be greatest in the areas where Colombia's illegal armed groups and criminal economies are strongest. A resident of southern Cordoba told La Silla Vacia that when the ELN announced their presence in the zone he closed his eyes and thought: ""Looks like we are in for more killing."""	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Weekly InSight: US Finances El Salvador Police Implicated in Abuses. In our May 31 Facebook Live session, InSight Crime Senior Investigator Hector Silva Avalos and Managing Editor Josefina Salomon analyzed a recent report that accused the United States of financing El Salvador police involved in human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings. The investigation , published by CNN, reported that the United States sent ""significant US funding"" to the Special Reaction Force (Fuerza Especializada de Reaccion - FES) of El Salvador's National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil - PNC), despite its alleged responsibility for the execution of 43 people suspected of belonging to gangs during the first six months of 2017. At the beginning of 2018, the FES was replaced by another specialized police unit. However, according to the investigation, some FES members joined the new unit and continue to receive funding from the United States. During their conversation, Salomon and Silva, who has investigated these reports, discussed the failed ""iron fist"" or zero-tolerance strategies utilized by Salvadoran authorities to mitigate the growing presence of gangs such as the MS13, as well as the United States' history of ignoring reports of abuses. They also talked about the possible impact of the next report that United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions Agnes Callamard will publish following a visit to El Salvador. During her recent visit to El Salvador, she strongly condemned abuses allegedly committed by security forces. Watch the complete Facebook Live discussion in Spanish below:"	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Gulf Cartel Boss Exploits Turmoil in Northeast Mexico. The shifting balance of power in northeast Mexico has been bad news for the Gulf Cartel , which has seen its influence decline, but a new report from Proceso suggests that one Gulf leader, known as "" El Coss ,"" has benefited from the changing landscape. The 2010 split between the Gulf Cartel and their erstwhile armed wing, the Zetas , has triggered hundreds of killings in the northeastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon, which the two groups previously ruled as, essentially, a single organization. The Zetas, whose expansion and violent tactics made them notorious even prior to the split, emerged with a larger share of the territory. Furthermore, as the maps below demonstrate, they have since expanded, now operating in far-flung states like Jalisco, and have even popped up in Sinaloa. Much of the territory in the northeast is disputed by the two gangs, however. In addition to fighting with the Zetas, the Gulf bosses have also been battling among themselves. As the Proceso article indicates, Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez, alias ""El Coss,"" was piqued at being only the third-ranking member of the group following the arrest and extradition of former leader Osiel Cardenas in the 2000s. According to an anonymous source, Costilla Sanchez has since focused on setting his rivals up to be arrested or killed by government forces, allowing him to emerge as the overall leader of the group. While the Gulf Cartel is a diminished force, it retains control of a number of significant border regions, most notably Reynosa and Matamoros, and continues to battle it out with the Zetas in other cities around the region, such as Monterrey and Tampico. Indeed, while its territory has been reduced, the Gulf's level of control in the areas that remain under its dominion seems to have hardened, despite the ongoing battle with the Zetas. According to Proceso , this is due to the links between Costilla Sanchez and high-level elements in the military. The anonymous source whose account was the basis for the story says that, in exchange for millions of dollars, army and marine commanders essentially give Costilla Sanchez free rein to operate in Mexico's northeastern region, and attack his enemies as needed. Under Costilla Sanchez, the Gulf Cartel's previous ruling clique has been displaced, thanks in large part to military pressure. Most notable was former leader Ezequiel "" Tony Tormenta "" Cardenas, Osiel's brother, who was killed in a shootout with marines in 2010. However, the fact that the entire article rests on the version of a single anonymous source, and has not been confirmed by any independent voices speaking on the record, raises suspicions. The idea that Costilla Sanchez's rise would be fueled by corrupt military officers is certainly not implausible, but if his enemies were looking to make life difficult both for him and for the military units operating in Tamaulipas, feeding falsehoods to reporters would be an easy way to do so. The following is an InSight Crime translation of extracts from the Proceso article. Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez, ""El Coss,"" has stealthily managed to remain outside Felipe Calderon's ""war on drugs"" and, entrenched in Tamaulipas along the US border, he has watched as the Cardenas Guillen clan has fallen apart. Betrayals and internal purges in the Gulf Cartel during the past year have little by little given him control of the group, which is now in alliance with Joaquin "" El Chapo "" Guzman, of the Sinaloa Cartel. His old allies accuse El Coss of betrayal, and of having handed in to the marines and the army the main members and collaborators of the family that turned the Gulf Cartel into one of the foremost criminal organizations in the country. The incorporation of elite army deserters who turned into the Zetas, as an armed wing, played a huge part in this achievement ""He has bought the protection of the federal government and has handed the Cardenas Guillen families and its closest collaborators over the marines"", the source said. In various meetings with this reporter, he explained that with the fall of Osiel Cardenas Guillen -- detained in 2003 and extradited four years later -- the leadership of the Gulf Cartel fell onto the shoulders of his brother Antonio Ezequiel, ""Tony Tormenta."" He was supported by Samuel Flores Borrego, ""El Metro 3,"" the second man in the criminal structure, who was made plaza boss in Reynosa. Although he was a confidant of Cardenas, Costilla Sanchez ended up third in the hierarchy. ""El Coss betrayed the Cardenas Guillens and El Metro 3 with the goal of taking over the Gulf Cartel. He made a deal with the commanders from the marines and the army in exchange for them not touching him and gave them, as a reward, houses with a lot of money,"" he says. And he warns that ""a war is coming"" for control of the Gulf Cartel. Costilla Sanchez, who since 2008 is facing two drug trafficking indictments in the United States under the aliases of ""El Coss,"" ""El Double X"" or ""Double Ex,"" is now identified by his old allies as ""El Judas."" According to the witness' version, the conflict began in 2010, when Costilla Sanchez sought an alliance with Nazario "" El Chayo "" Moreno Gonzalez, then the boss of the Familia Michoacana. El Coss sent his brother-in-law, Ezequiel Campos Ramos, alias ""El Chacho,"" and his nephew, ""El Pato"" Campos, to carry out the negotiation. The pact consisted of El Chayo -- who was killed by marines in December of that year in Apatzingan -- sending gunmen to Reynosa to combat the Zetas in exchange for allowing the Familia Michoacana to pass drugs through a highway known as the Riberena. Tony Tormenta and El Metro 3 did not go along with the plan. The Riberena is crucial to the passage of drugs in northeastern Mexico. It connects Reynosa to Nuevo Laredo, to the entrance to Texas, and movement toward southern and central Mexico. The communities that surround cities like Diaz Ordaz, Miguel Aleman and Camargo, in the path of the Riberena, have turned into enclaves for organized crime, particularly the zone known as Brecha de Lucio, near Diaz Ordaz, which lies along the route to Monterrey. [El Coss] has brought men from the Guatemalan regions of Peten, Alta Verapaz, and Coban, who work for him as hitmen and ""cooks"" to disappear enemies. But above all, the source says, he counts on the support of the armed forces, especially the marines, to do away the Cardenas Guillens. In one of the meetings, the witness said that last August, El Coss had handed over 30 million pesos, equivalent to one month of salaries for his criminal structure, so that the marines and the army would carry out faked patrols and their troops would avoid passing by the sites where drugs cross to the other side of the Rio Grande. According to this version, the payment was in exchange for informing El Coss about the operations of soldiers and marines so that his men wouldn't run into them. When the payment was made, the witness added, on the radios that the organization provides you could hear the irritation of the gunmen because they did not receive their salary that month. As a consequence, kidnappings and robberies increased in the region. Payments like this allow the capo to move around Matamoros without anyone doing anything to him, according to information from the source. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Colombia Cartel Laundered European Profits Through Ecuador. Colombia 's Norte del Valle drug cartel has been laundering money through a network in Ecuador, according to the Ecuadorian authorities. This was discovered through the Spanish Police's operation ""Espejo"" (Mirror), which has been in progress for the past two years, reported Ecuadorian newspaper El Comercio. The Norte del Valle Cartel is generally considered defunct. Those involved in the laundering ring could be former Valle operatives acting independently, or perhaps members of the Rastrojos , a gang which started as an armed force for one faction of Norte del Valle, before taking over much of the group's old territory. According to the report, money from drug sales in Europe was sent to Ecuador through remittances and internet transfers to front companies. It was then distributed among in different bank accounts to be withdrawn in quantities below $30 by various individuals, who would physically take the cash to Colombia and deliver it to cartel members. The Ecuadorian Money Laundering Unit said that between 2007 and 2010, the organization transferred about $4.5 million through the Internet and sent 2.1 million euros disguised as remittances in 2010. The investigations was carried out in six municipalities of Ecuador, and has found four front companies and 470 people involved in the operations in that country. There is an arrest warrant for all suspects, but most have not been found, an officer told El Comercio. "	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Shadow of Perrones Looms over El Salvador Mayors Arrest. The arrest in El Salvador of a mayor suspected of drug trafficking has raised new questions about politicians' complicity with organized crime groups in the Central American country. Jose Carlos Ramirez Umanzor, mayor of the small eastern town of Pasaquina and member of the opposition party ARENA, was arrested by Salvadoran authorities on May 31, reported La Prensa Grafica. Ramirez Umanzor has been accused by the country's Attorney General's Office of leading a drug trafficking network in the eastern part of the country close to the border with Honduras and Nicaragua, through the Gulf of Fonseca. According to anti-drug police, the criminal group included another municipal official from Pasaquina as well as Santos Ernesto Luna, brother of the late drug trafficker Jose Natividad Luna Pereira, also known as Chepe Luna, who was one of the key leaders of the Perrones drug trafficking group by the beginning of the 2000s. During the last decade Pasaquina served as a key center of operations for the Perrones, one of two criminal organizations that a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said flourished in El Salvador thanks to the complicity and support of local politicians. Pasaquina is connected to blind spots along the border with Honduras through a highway and rural paths, to the Gulf of Fonseca's mangroves and to the Panamerican Highway through the neighboring cities of Santa Rosa de Lima and San Miguel. Thus, it has long been a perfect crossroads for the smuggling of cocaine by go-fast boats leaving South America for El Salvador. Already by the mid-2000s, police and news reports had linked another ARENA mayor from Pasaquina, Hector Odir Ramirez, with Chepe Luna. During his time in office, authorities believe Ramirez provided Luna with some allegedly irregular birth certificates. One of the key advisors to former President Antonio Saca Gonzalez (ARENA, 2004-2009) and Mauricio Funes (2009-2014), Herbert Saca Vides, has also been linked to the Perrones. Saca Vides shared the same lawyer with one of the gang's leaders, and also received money transfers from another member of the criminal group who came under investigation for drug trafficking in the 1990s. Several high-level police chiefs were also investigated by the police internal affairs unit in 2010 for their alleged links with Luna and the Perrones, but the investigations were halted under the Funes administration. Pasaquina, Luna and the Perrones gang are legendary names in El Salvador's underworld. The arrest of the mayor of Pasaquina, one of the crucial centers of operation for the gang, and that of Chepe Luna's brother raise several questions about the ability of Salvadoran drug traffickers to recycle themselves and take up arms, thanks largely to the protection guaranteed by political elites. In January 2012, Salvadoran authorities sentenced Reynerio Flores Lazo, another leader of the Perrones, to 80 years in prison for four counts of drug trafficking. According to police reports carried out in those years, Flores Lazo and the Perrones smuggled at least 2.4 tons of cocaine between Costa Rica and El Salvador in 2004 alone. Following his capture, the arrest of other leaders and the assassination of Chepe Luna in Honduras, it was widely assumed that the Perrones had disappeared from El Salvador. However, after 2011, new evidence emerged suggesting drug traffickers in the eastern regions of the country were still smuggling drugs. That year, intelligence reports by the police showed that former members of the group were purchasing land in El Salvador and Honduras, and were still trafficking cocaine. According to police sources quoted by La Prensa Grafica, the organization led by the arrested Mayor Ramirez Umanzor also smuggled cocaine from Costa Rica. Another individual captured during the operation was Darwin Rodriguez Estrada, a Guatemalan national whom authorities have linked with two kilograms of cocaine smuggled from Costa Rica. On the same day of Mayor Ramirez Umanzor's arrest, authorities captured Jorge Mario Marroquin Fuentes and four other people in a boat carrying 840 kilograms of cocaine on Salvadoran waters. Marroquin is the brother of Carlos Alberto Marroquin, mayor of Moyuta, a city in Guatemala's southern department of Jutiapa, another city the Perrones have used for their drug trafficking operations. The capture of Pasaquina's mayor, Chepe Luna's brother and the Guatemalan nationals linked with Jutiapa highlight how old criminal transport groups, aided by the authorities' complicity, are still active and continue to manage the region's drug trafficking routes.	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Guatemalas President says Business Proposal for Emergency Measures ""Positive"". Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom said a private business group's proposed ""states of emergency"" in violent and crime-ridden regions of the country was ""positive,"" according to a report in Guatemala's daily La Prensa Libre. Last week, t he Guatemalan Chamber of Industry (CIG) called for increased security cameras and ""special forces"" along highways to protect transport trucks, among other capital. The frustration of the CIG is part of the growing discontent about the continued lack of security in the country. According to the US Department of State , Guatemala is one of the most violent countries in Latin America, in which eighteen people die every day in crime-related deaths. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Seeks to Contain Extortion by Doubling Sentences. Colombia, suffering explosive growth in extortion demands, is seeking to almost double sentences for those convicted of the crime. In a legislative project to be brought before Congress, the Colombian government plans to almost double the maximum sentence for extortion from 18 to 32 years. The minimum sentence for those convicted of extortion would jump from 8 to 16 years. Some estimates have put the annual criminal income from extortion at over $1 billion. According to the specialized anti-kidnapping and anti-extortion unit of the police, the GAULA, small businesses pay between $250 and $2500 a month, depending on their earnings. Even many street vendors have to pay extortion fees of up to a dollar a day to be allowed to operate. If the law is passed, it would bring the sentencing for extortion into the same range as that for murder. The average conviction for premeditated murder in Colombia is around 25 years. Extortion used to be the preserve of Marxist rebels, who targeted the big national and multinational corporations. Today, while the rebels are still deeply involved in extortion, they have been overtaken by the new generation of drug trafficking groups, known as the BACRIM (from the goverment's description of the groups as ""bandas criminals""). The profile of the victim has also changed dramatically. The extortion of big companies and multi-nationals has actually fallen, while ""micro extortion"" has undergone explosive growth, with most victims now local shop owners and small businesses. Broadly speaking, the rebels impose most of their extortion demands in rural areas, or the smaller urban centers, although there are indications that the guerrillas are seeking to expand their extortion activities into the major cities. However in the top three urban centers of Colombia -- the capital Bogota, Medellin and Cali -- extortion rackets are predominantly run by local street gangs or the BACRIM. The introduction of this legislation is perhaps a knee-jerk reaction by the government, which is fighting the general perception that the security situation is worsening, even as it engages in peace talks with the Marxist insurgency. What is clear is that crime, particularly in the urban centers, is increasing, and extortion is leading the charge."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Paraguay Police Cmdr Charged as Corruption Scandal Grows. The commander of Paraguay's national police has been charged in connection with a corruption scandal involving money siphoned from the agency's gasoline fund, a rare indictment in a country where few corrupt officials are prosecuted. On May 19, President Horacio Cartes removed National Police Commander Francisco Alvarenga from his post for his alleged connection to a growing gas scandal involving several police officers, including Alvarenga's son, reported ABC Color. The following day, Interior Minister Francisco de Vargas announced that both Alvarenga and the administrative director of the national police, Carlos Jara, had been charged with ""breach of trust"". Six police officers have been implicated in the scandal for allegedly withdrawing around $230,000 from gasoline cards that were intended to refuel police vehicles, according to ABC Color. The officers reportedly purchased flashy cars and expensive houses with the money. Alvarenga's own ties to the scandal are tenuous -- the indictment faults him for negligent conduct for failing to actively prevent the scam -- but his son, Francisco Alvarenga Rotela, has been charged with illicit enrichment for allegedly aiding the supposed leader of the corruption network. At a press conference announcing the charges, Vargas stated that the legal proceedings amount to ""one of the few times a sitting commander has been charged with a crime."" Police corruption is a major problem in Paraguay, which is ranked by Transparency International as the third most corrupt country in the Americas, after Venezuela and Haiti. There have been numerous cases of police corruption in recent years, especially in the provinces that border Brazil, which are home to marijuana producing areas. In one recent case, an investigation implicated a network of police in Paraguay's Canindeyu province who reportedly accepted bribes from drug traffickers, and passed money along to their superiors. The police are far from the only government agency affected by corruption in Paraguay. In October 2014, the murder of a journalist who was reporting on the country's drug trade also exposed ties between politicians and drug traffickers. Shortly afterwards, the head of Paraguay's anti-drug agency expressed concern about drug traffickers purchasing protection from politicians, military, and judicial officials. While few of the politicians exposed by the narco-politics scandal appear to have faced legal action, the recent charges against high level police officials are a welcome change from the country's normally high levels of impunity. However, shuffling the top leadership is unlikely to curb misconduct in an agency in which corruption appears to be endemic."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Weekly InSight: Narco-Terrorism in Latin America, How Real Is the Threat?In our August 10 Facebook Live session, Senior Editor Mike LaSusa spoke with Simon Fraser University Research Associate Benoit Gomis about the myths and realities of the threat of ""narco-terroism"" in Latin America. The conversation began with LaSusa asking Gomis about his analysis of the threat posed by terrorist groups like Hezbollah and the Islamic State in Latin America and the Caribbean. Gomis explained why he believes that the threat posed by these groups -- though it is real -- has often been inflated, typically for political reasons, and how this has at times distracted from more pressing security concerns. LaSusa and Gomis also discussed the threats posed by other terrorist groups in the region -- such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN), and Peru's Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) -- and how militaristic policy approaches have often failed to address underlying factors sustaining these groups' activities and driving recruitment.

"Car Bomb a Hint that Colombias Guerrilla Tactics Spreading to Ecuador. Authorities are blaming FARC dissidents for a car bomb near the Colombia-Ecuador border, a sign that former rebels may be looking to expand their presence in this porous border region. The bomb, which exploded January 27 in front of a police station in the strategic port town of San Lorenzo in Ecuador's coastal Esmeraldas province, injured 28, El Universo reported. Ecuador officials said the attack was carried out by dissidents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), El Universo reported January 29. Shortly after, Colombia Attorney General Nestor Martinez also linked the car bombing to a ""FARC dissident of Ecuadorean origin, alias 'Guacho,'"" El Universo reported separately. Officials in Ecuador declared a state of emergency in San Lorenzo after the explosion, and have since reinforced security along the country's northern border with Colombia, according to two Defense Ministry press releases. The FARC have long had a presence in Ecuador, and the guerrillas' 48th Front used northern Ecuador as a key logistical center for the rebels' Southern Bloc in the past. The authorities' conclusion seems quick but correct: a car bomb, aimed at a police station is the rebels', or in this case, former rebels' modus operandi. Ecuador has long served as a transshipment nation for cocaine trafficking given its geographic location between Colombia and Peru, two of the world's main coca-producing countries. But recent multi-ton cocaine seizures and the arrest of Washington Prado Alava, alias ""Gerard"" or ""Gerald,"" -- often referred to as Ecuador's "" Pablo Escobar "" -- suggest that the country's role in the drug trade is evolving. With Colombia's criminal world fragmented and criminal economies now up for grabs following the FARC's demobilization , the recent violence along the Colombia-Ecuador border suggests that FARC dissidents are trying to take hold of this strategic border region in an effort to solidify their control over the cross-border drug trade. Following the demobilization of the FARC in 2017, dissident members of the guerrilla group started to form criminal groups in Ecuador to continue with illegal activities previously controlled by the rebel group, primarily drug trafficking. The dismantling of a drug lab along the Colombia-Ecuador border in June 2017 provided further evidence that dissident rebels were maintaining drug trafficking activities in the border region. Expect violence like this to continue. Guacho, the FARC dissident allegedly behind the car bomb, has been linked to other bloody confrontations in areas strategic to the cocaine trade in the past. *This article was written with assistance from Sergio Saffon."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Army Captures, Kills More Criminals than Rebels. Colombia's army has reported the capture, surrender or death of 4,637 criminals and insurgents in the first six months of 2013, with the breakdown in figures offering a snapshot of Colombia's changing criminal landscape. According to Ministry of Defense figures , 2,480 of the total number belonged to ""gangs,"" 630 to criminal bands (""bandas criminales"" or BACRIM), 1,221 to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas, 82 to the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels, and 202 were drug traffickers. The Armed Forces arrested 3,896 people, while 528 surrendered voluntarily, and 213 -- the overwhelming majority guerrillas -- were killed in combat. The army also reported the seizure of over 1,500 firearms, over 2,000 grenades and over 800 vehicles -- including motorcycles, boats and cars. In addition, the army reported destroying 35,409 hectares of coca crops -- 4,459 manually and 30,950 by aerial spraying -- and 727 illegal cocaine laboratories, as well as seizing 4.8 tons of cocaine and 21.4 tons of marijuana. Individuals the Defense Ministry labels as ""members of criminal organizations"" account for over half of the total of those ""taken out of combat,"" pointing to the increasing prominance of criminal groups in the Colombian conflict. For their part, Colombia's police reported dismantling over 700 gangs in 2012 , but the revelation that the army too has spent considerable efforts in tackling ""criminal organizations"" is surprising, and raises questions over where to draw the line between crime and Colombia's war. Still, such classifications can also be misleading. The influence of larger criminal organizations, especially the BACRIM, spreads far, and many of those labelled as common criminals may well be operating with or on the behalf of more powerful groups that once had political motives and remain large scale armies in their own right. In some areas, such as Medellin and Cali, gangs carry out most of the violence, but do so on behalf of their BACRIM paymasters who, like the guerrillas, often wear camouflage and operate as an insurgency would."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Reports of Army Human Rights Abuses Plummet in Mexico. Authorities in Mexico say complaints of human rights abuses perpetrated by the army decreased dramatically over two years, but a recent massacre carried out by Mexican soldiers indicates that the data may not tell the whole story. At a commemoration of Army Day on February 19, Mexico's Secretary of Defense Salvador Cienfuegos said the number of army abuses reported to the country's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) dropped by over 60 percent between 2012 and 2014, reported Milenio. In 2012, the CNDH received 1,450 complaints of human rights abuses by members of the army, compared to just 570 last year (see graph below). Cienfuegos also noted that only four -- or 0.2 percent -- of the complaints against the army reported during the last two years were verified by the CNDH, reported Informador. At the event, President Enrique Pena Nieto stated that ""the honor of our armed forces is above any suspicion or doubt."" At first glance, the remarkable drop in complaints of abuse lodged against the Mexican army would suggest that authorities are finally reigning in the excessive use of force by security personnel during the country's drug war, which began in 2006 under former President Felipe Calderon. Maureen Meyer, Senior Associate for Mexico at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), told InSight that after taking office in December 2012, Pena Nieto withdrew military forces -- a principal source of abuses in Mexico -- from some areas of the country, and also put a greater emphasis on respecting human rights. However, it is unlikely Pena Nieto's security reforms were sweeping enough to cause such a dramatic decrease in human rights abuses by the army. The CNDH's findings that soldiers massacred at least 15 individuals in June 2014, as well as allegations that the Mexican army may have been involved in the disappearances of 43 students who went missing last September, suggest military abuses remain a major concern under Pena Nieto's administration. What's more, the CNDH may not have sufficient autonomy to accurately report the number of abuses perpetrated by security forces. The former Ombudsman of the CNDH, Raul Plascencia, has been hesitant to criticize Pena Nieto on human rights, according to Meyer, who said, ""this drop [in reports of abuses] may have less to do with a change on the ground and more to do with how the CNDH was registering cases or certifying complaints."" An unknown number of human rights abuse cases went unreported due to a lack of trust in the CNDH to conduct a thorough investigation or because victims were pressured by the military not to file the report, Meyer added."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Town Outside Medellin Sees Murders Rise Then Drop. The tense calm that had persisted for six years in the town of Bello, near Medellin in Colombia, has been shattered in 2019, as homicides have spiked by 175 percent in the first half of the year. Between January and June of 2019, Bello saw 105 deaths, up from just 38 recorded during the same period in 2018. This rise is due to an escalating conflict between three local gangs: Los Pachelly, Los Mesa and Niquia Camacol, all of which vying for control of the town in the Valle de Aburra, according to a warning issued by the Ombudsman's Office in September. SEE ALSO : Colombia News and Profile It also warned that residents were threatened through social network posts and through printed pamphlets, and that they were also forced to leave their homes. Gangs were also recruiting youths. The violence has taken place in at least 13 neighborhoods, but has largely been concentrated in northern Bello in the areas of Bellavista, Altos de Niquia, Niquia and Suarez. Colombia's President Ivan Duque announced at the end of June that an army battalion would be sent to these communities to stop the violence and to crack down on the criminal gangs. A reduction in violence during the past two months, however, has been attributed to a new truce among the gangs, Verdad Abierta reported. The gangs announced an August 27 ceasefire via WhatsApp, seemingly aware of the official attention the violence had drawn to them. The truce could also involve larger criminal gangs, according to Verdad Abierta. The Oficina de Envigado and Urabenos are reported to have brokered the truce, but InSight Crime was not able to confirm this. The truce in Bello is a positive step, given the level of violence that preceded it. But the town's strategic location in the Valle de Aburra and the criminal profits it holds means the truce is likely to only be temporary. For almost 15 years, much of Bello has been under the control of Los Pachelly, a gang hailing from a neighborhood of the same name. Their senior leader, Albert Henao Acevedo, is believed to be one of the main drivers of the violence impacting the town as his gang's dominance is threatened. Los Pachelly have ruled through connections to politicians and institutions in the region, which granted them protection and the ability to expand. But that expansion came at a cost. As Los Pachelly's ambitions have expanded, especially into illegal gold mining in other parts of Antioquia, it turned over portions of local criminal economies in Bello to trusted lieutenants and allied smaller gangs, such as Niquia Camacol and Los Mesa, according to information from the Ombudsman's Office. Both Los Mesa and Niquia Camacol emerged in parts of Bello over three decades ago, first serving as local links in the drug trafficking chain controlled by the Oficina de Envigado in the 1990s. More recently, they served in a similar capacity for Los Pachelly. But disputes arose concerning how criminal profits from extortion, illegal mining and drug trafficking were being distributed, as confirmed by El Colombiano. These differences came to a head in February 2019, when a lieutenant of Los Pachelly was gunned down allegedly by a dissident faction within the group, which allied themselves with Niquia Camacol and Los Mesa. SEE ALSO : For Medellin's Oficina Capos, the Shuffle is Part of the Game The 2019 war has been fought over the main criminal economies in Bello: drug trafficking, microtrafficking and extortion. Bello is positioned along a key drug trafficking route along the Valle de Aburra. Coca cultivated in parts of Colombia's central and San Lucas mountain ranges enters the Valle de Aburra through the municipality of Barbosa where it is processed. From there, the cocaine makes its way to Bello, a key stop on drug routes to Colombia's northwest, especially the Gulf of Uraba and the Pacific Ocean. Extortion is also prevalent. Extortion fees , known locally as ""vacunas,"" are demanded from public transport operators, street salesmen and even residents going to the market. More recently, real estate developers and construction companies have also been targeted , as Bello has seen an increase in land speculation. Mauricio Soto, a researcher at the Instituto Popular de Capacitacion (IPC) think tank in Antioquia, said that the truce could stabilize Bello through the end of 2019, but that it would be very difficult to sustain in the long term. ""It is surprising that this peaceful process came from the gangs. A deal like this calms the situation and happens mainly due to the high costs of maintaining a war. But any criminal pact can be easily broken,"" he told InSight Crime."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Mexico Launches Official Vigilante Unit in Rocky Legalization Process. Hundreds of vigilantes have joined Mexico's new ""Rural Defense Force"" as part of a move to legalize self-defense militas, creating a potentially critical rift between militias prepared to be absorbed by the state and the many more that remain outside the law. On May 11, the state of Michoacan's security commissioner, Alfredo Castillo, officially launched the ""State Rural Defense Force"" with the creation of a 450-strong unit made up of members of the state's self-defense militias, reported El Universal. Among the first officers of the new force, which officials presented with arms, uniforms and vehicles, was the new official spokesperson for the General Council of Michoacan Self-Defense Forces, Estanislao Beltran, alias ""Papa Smurf."" Beltran told reporters, ""We are legal now and we are committed to this, we are part of the government."" The new force will begin operating in the municipalities of Tepalcatepec and Buena Vista Tomatlan, with the scheme slated to be later rolled out across the state. Over 3,000 of an estimated 20,000 members of the self-defense militias applied to join the new force ahead of the registration deadline, although many did not pass exams or basic training. Animal Politico reported that among the new recruits there was uncertainty over what their role was to be, and over other issues such as pay, benefits and working hours and conditions. The launch of the first Rural Defense Force marks the implementation of an agreement between vigilante groups and the government signed in Janaury this year. The pact was an attempt by the government to get a grip on a situation that had rapidly spiraled out of control, and to strike a balance between helping citizens fight back against organized crime -- which they claimed they were doing as a result of state failings -- and preventing unchecked vigilante justice. There are numerous obstacles facing the Rural Defense Force strategy in this regard, including the lack of clear definitions over members' roles and relationship to state forces, and their long term place in regional security structures. However, perhaps the greatest concern is the thousands of militiamen who remain outside the process. Some of these already work for militias believed to be linked to criminal groups, and even those that do not could be tempted to abuse or profit from their power, or work for criminal interests, now that they stand on the wrong side of the line drawn by the government."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Jailbreaks Just the Most Obvious Problem of Mexicos Prisons. Seventeen inmates in the northeastern Mexican state of Tamaulipas tunneled out of a prison in Reynosa, offering another glimpse of a system that is struggling to keep up with the demands placed upon it by President Felipe Calderon's aggressive anti-crime strategy. While jails across Mexico are vulnerable, escapes in the state of Tamaulipas in particular have become an all-too-common occurrence. According to El Universal , five of the eight documented jailbreaks in 2010 took place in the state, which has become ground zero of an ongoing territorial battle between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. Almost 300 inmates escaped from the state's jails in last year, with 141 of them slipping out of a prison in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas in December. Mass flights from prisons outside of Tamaulipas have also earned notoriety. The most famous was the escape of 53 alleged Zetas from a prison in Cieneguillas, Zacatecas in 2009; the prisoners' collaborators on the outside showed up to the prison dressed as Federal Police agents, and marched the convicts out the front door. The escapes are just one of a number of problems in Mexican prisons, all of them indicating a lack of governmental control over the jails. Roughly at the same time as the most recent Reynosa escape hit the news wires, the government in Chihuahua announced the discovery of a full bar in a low-security prison outside of the state capital, complete with several hundred bottles of tequila, vodka, and beer, as well as multiple pool tables. While the bar example was extreme, stories of powerful inmates running roughshod over the ostensible prison bosses are legion. During his time in the maximum-security Puente Grande, from which he escaped in a laundry bin in 2001, Sinaloa kingpin Joaquin Guzman alias "" El Chapo ,"" enjoyed dalliances with prostitutes and numerous other trappings of life on the outside. A few yeas later, former Gulf boss Osiel Cardenas spent almost four years inside of the maximum-security facility known as La Palma. While there, he continued to direct his organization and lead a vicious battle with Guzman's group. Violent deaths inside prisons have also become quite common. In May alone, prisoners have died in Nuevo Leon , Mazatlan , Cancun , and Durango. Frequent attacks against staff , from wardens on down through the hierarchy, have left prison personnel cowed. In one of the most notorious incidents, inmates at a prison in Gomez Palacio, Durango, were being allowed to leave during the night so as to carry out executions of their rivals. Part of the problem stems from the increased size of the prison population, thanks in large part to Calderon's aggressive crime policy. The tens of thousands of new inmates arrested on charges related to organized crime have overwhelmed the prison system; Mexico 429 prisons collectively suffer from 25 percent overcapacity. Furthermore, in an attempt to compensate, many prisoners arrested on federal organized crime and drug charges have been diverted to state and local prisons. As a result, many of the most dangerous criminals are doing their time in the facilities that are least capable of adequately controlling them. While improving the prison system is thankless work -- especially compared to the photo op-laden efforts to arm the police with new helicopters and firepower -- a comprehensive fix to Mexican security without a concomitant effort to eliminate the criminal sanctuary inside the prisons is virtually impossible. The current pattern after a major jailbreak or riot is to send in federal troops to calm the situation and, where complicity is evident, arrest the warden and members of his or her staff. However, this amounts to little more than putting out fires; Mexico has not carried out an thorough examination of the fundamental drivers of the chaos in the nation's prison system. As in Mexico, many of the penal systems in Latin America have been overwhelmed by inmate populations far larger than maximum intended capacity. As a result, the ostensible authorities are unable to exercise control over the prisons, ceding it in many cases to the gangs organized behind bars. This, in turn, means that prisons are not centers for rehabilitation, but rather finishing schools for crimes. Indeed, the problem is even worse elsewhere. Whereas in Mexico prisons have failed to interrupt gang activities, in Brazil and Central America, prisons have actively fostered the creation of new gangs and ensured the strengthening of existing groups. The ""Primeiro Comando da Capital"" (PCC), or First Capital Command, was founded by eight prisoners in a Sao Paolo prison in 1993. The group grew in potency both within the prison system and without, culminating in a series of violent acts in May 2006 which left 141 people dead. The PCC, which is now one of the principal criminal groups in the country, has carried out assassination of law enforcement personnel, judges, and other public officials. The maras in Central America have also used stints in jail to further their power. The quantity of members of the two principal Central American gangs, MS-13 and Barrio 18, behind El Salvadoran bars spiked in the early 2000s thanks to the ""mano dura,"" or firm hand, policies of President Antonio Saca. But because rival gangs were initially housed in the same jails, which were now overflowing with inmates, the facilities suffered periodic explosions of violence. In response, El Salvador separated the members of MS-13 and Barrio 18 into separate jails, and left them to their devices. This had the perverse effect of actually facilitating their activities. They were safer in their single-gang jails than they were on the street, and had more time to plan out new criminal enterprises. The maras began to branch out into kidnapping and extortion, with the illegal schemes largely controlled by the members of the gang in prisons. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Calderon Offers Conflicting Statistics on Fall in Mexicos Homicides. President Felipe Calderon declared that Mexico's homicide rate fell seven percent in the first half of 2012, contradicting earlier claims that it had fallen by as much as 20 percent in the same period. Speaking at the 33rd session of the National Public Security Council on August 2, President Calderon announced that Mexico's homicide rate fell seven percent in the first six months of 2012, in comparison to the same period in 2011. He also reported that homicides ""presumed to be related to criminal rivalry"" fell 15 percent, and that his administration had killed or captured 22 of the 37 ""most dangerous criminal leaders"" in Mexico. He declined to give specific figures about the number of murders. Calderon added that over the course of his time in office, organized criminal groups in Mexico have transitioned away from fighting only for control of trafficking routes to the US and towards developing a domestic market for drugs. The president noted that in order to consolidate control over these markets, known as ""narcomenudeo,"" or ""micro-trafficking,"" groups coerce citizens and authorities into working with them, often through the threat of violence. Calderon's assertion that homicides dropped seven percent is curious in light of recent announcements regarding the fall. On June 13, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Calderon stated that drug-related murders were down 12 percent in the first half of 2012 while on July 15, he told Spanish newspaper El Pais that violent homicides had declined between 15 and 20 percent over the first six months of 2012. Calderon explained that his refusal to cite specific figures stemmed from criticism from human rights groups that his administration pre-judges whether homicides are related to organized crime without waiting for verdicts from the judicial system. The conflicting numbers and methodologies used by different government branches, newspapers, and NGOs makes drawing conclusions on official figures for Mexico's violence difficult. The most recent official report, released in January by the Attorney General's Office, counted 12,903 crime-linked homicides in 2011, bringing the total number since December 2006 to 47,515. Many observers, however, have expressed scepticism over these numbers; Molly Malloy, a researcher at the New Mexico State University Library who maintains an exhaustive tally of Mexico's drug casualties using a variety of sources, places the total homicides from December 2006 to June 2012 at 99,667. As analyst Alejandro Hope noted in January, drug violence does seems to have stabilized since 2010, with homicides in 2011 increasing at a much slower rate than in the three preceding years. But even with this improvement, Mexico will not return to the 2007 homicide rate until 2018. Regardless of whether the number of homicides has stabilized or decreased, other forms of drug-related crime continue to rise. Due to gang fragmentation and the transition Calderon mentioned towards domestic drug markets, the number of kidnappings, cases of extortion, and violent robberies increased in 2011. By some estimates , the rate of extortion has more than doubled over the course of Calderon's presidency. "	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Mexico Cyber Criminals Kidnapping Business Computer Systems. Hackers in Mexico have found a profitable illicit enterprise in extorting businesses by hijacking computer systems, another dimension in the country's large and growing cyber crime industry. Speaking at a security conference in Mexico City, the head of Mexico's Scientific Police Division, Ciro Humberto Ortiz Estrada, described how hackers remotely ""kidnap"" the computer systems and databases of businesses, reported La Jornada. The criminals then demand payment -- usually between $2,000 and $3,000 -- for the user to regain access to the system. The individual or company is normally forced to pay by electronic transfer into national or foreign bank accounts. Small and medium sized businesses are the most vulnerable to these attacks, as they often do not have the sophisticated protection systems of larger companies, according to Ortiz. Ortiz warned cyber crime in Mexico was growing rapidly: while criminals made an estimated $2 billion from cyber crime in 2012, this increased to $3 billion in 2013, he said. Over the course of 2013, Mexico's Federal Police registered 23,543 cyber crime cases. Mexico's high internet connectivity and abundance of criminal groups have made it a growing hub for cyber crime -- which more commonly takes the form of hacking, scams, fraud and theft. Reports of cyber extortion in Mexico are not new, with a 2011 McAfee survey of electricity infrastructure executives revealing that up to 80 percent of Mexican participants had been subject to cyber extortion. However, the extortion reported by McAfee was principally based on threatening to bring down networks with distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS). The strategy of holding systems for ransom described by Ortiz suggests the crime is evolving. Elsewhere in the region, less sophisticated forms of extortion that make use of the internet are also taking hold. In Colombia, for example, extortionists track down personal data online and use it to blackmail victims. Mexico is now taking steps to address the problem of cyber crime. In 2012, the country created the National Cyber Incident Response Center (CERT-MX) , and according to Ortiz, the federal government is currently evaluating a legal reform that will establish penalties for specific cyber crimes. However, as illustrated by the latest reported extortion techniques, the challenge is not limited to establishing new judicial and institutional mechanisms for tackling cyber crime, but also involves keeping up with a rapidly evolving criminal sector."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Guatemalan Officials, Lawyers Accused Of Using Child Prostitutes. In a scandal that highlights official tolerance of illegal sex, authorities in Guatemala have dismantled a child prostitution ring allegedly involving high-ranking officials. Five people accused of selling children for sex and six suspected clients have been captured, including the son of a Supreme Court magistrate, lawyer Cesar Barrientos Aguirre, reported Prensa Libre. The arrests follow the rescue of various victims in the southwestern department of Suchitepequez last December, alongside three suspected human traffickers. Barrientos was defending two of those three suspects during a court hearing in January when he was apparently recognized by one of the child victims. It is alleged that ""exclusive"" clients -- including doctors, senators, and other government officials -- paid between $75 and $255 for sex with girls aged between 13 and 17, reported Prensa Libre. The children received $12 to $24 for each ""activity,"" said prosecutors. Two Suchitepequez mayors were also among the clients, according to Leonal Dubon , the director of a children's refuge who was named one of the US Department of State's Trafficking In Persons 'Heroes' in its 2011 report. Prosecutors requested that the case involving the three suspected human traffickers arrested in December be moved to a court in Guatemala City; however, their petition was denied, with critics claiming it was because of Barrientos' relation to the Supreme Court magistrate. Prostitution is legal in Guatemala, but all forms of trafficking are prohibited. All prostitution involving minors is also illegal. However the United Nations Special Rapporteur on child trafficking Najay Maalla M'jid warned last year that child prositution was still a significant problem in the country, exacerbated by an inefficient judical system and high levels of impunity.

"Beltrames Last Lap: An Audience With Rios Top Cop. Rio de Janeiro State's Public Safety Secretary Jose Mariano Beltrame -- who has led Rio's efforts to modernize its police force through the creation of Police Pacification Units (UPP), among other projects -- laid bare the results of his tenure, as well as the challenges ahead for the project, at a recent public event chronicled by Rio-based blogger Julia Michaels. Beltrame trudged up the stairs of the Osteria dell' Angolo restaurant. Getting to the top, he leant heavily against the doorframe, as if in great back pain. Minutes later, however, he was animatedly discussing almost seven years of highs and lows, spent between favelas and his Being John Malkovich-ish headquarters atop Rio's central train station. This article originally appeared on the Rio Real blog. See original article here. ""You have to put the police into the twenty-first century,"" he said. ""But you don't have boots or radios. That is this country's problem."" Rio Police Now Busier with Demonstrators than Anything Else Beltrame said he expects public demonstrations -- which center on social inequality and decades of failed government policies -- to continue, and murmured that he'll soon implement a new strategy on this count. Though Rio de Janeiro state Governor Sergio Cabral's administration will be well on its way out by the time of the June-July 2014 World Cup, with a gubernatorial election next October, the Cup final and six other games will be played in Rio de Janeiro, which saw violent protests during the recent Confederations Cup. Beltrame also announced the creation of an ombudsman's office in Rocinha -- Rio's largest favela -- to hear complaints about police abuse. This is the favela where police officers allegedly tortured a laborer to death in July ; ten officers have been arrested in conjunction with Amarildo de Souza's death and 13 more are expected to be indicted. Meanwhile, another favela resident has died in suspicious police-related circumstances , in Manguinhos favela. Everyone, including the public at large in the OsteRio debate -- one of a series of public debates on the future of the city -- and Institute of Religious Studies' ( ISER ) Pedro Strozenberg, who hosted it, took care to contextualize criticism amid praise for the achievements of Rio's pacification program, which began in 2008. No one asked about the much-proposed unification of Rio's military and civil police forces , and Beltrame didn't directly answer specific queries about police abuse or the expressed need for increased dialogue with security forces. Beltrame was also diplomatic with his own criticisms, pointing the finger above all at ""society"" and calling for ""structural change."" Still, it was clear that the secretary faults the Brazilian judiciary and Rio's municipal government for many of the difficulties he's faced over the years. ""You go to a birosca (small bar) to seize a caca-niquel (illegal slot machine), and you find that the owner uses illegal hookups for electricity and water, that he has no building permit, that no one is inspecting the joelhos and pasteis (snacks) he's selling,"" Beltrame complained, adding that most of the Police Pacification Unit ( UPP ) offices still function in containers because of lawsuits preventing the police from constructing more permanent offices, onsite. In the Pavao-Pavaozinho favela, he added, he must increase the number of police officers patrolling the area because residents are building skywards, despite city regulations to the contrary. Beltrame praised the work of the city's Pereira Passos Institute president Eduarda la Rocque (who was present) with the Social UPP, but said he'd like to see more integration with city agencies. ""Public administration doesn't function in an integrated manner,"" he lamented. Asked about police action against "" milicias "" (violent paramilitary groups operating mostly in the West Zone, extorting residents and shopkeepers, monopolizing key resources), he pointed out that the lack of legitimate businesses offering bottled gas and cable TV, for example, leads to the return of such groups, even when arrests occur, using stepped-up investigation and a new federal law that typifies paramilitary crimes. Beltrame also mentioned the difficulties favelas have with polluted rivers and sewage, a responsibility of the state concession, CEDAE. He said that police officers deal with issues he considers beyond their responsibility, because other institutions aren't meeting residents' needs. At the same time, Beltrame said, the Brazilian judiciary is perhaps overdoing its job. Most of those arrested last week after a teachers' demonstration downtown have been released by court order. ""Those who do the monitoring have more power than those with executive functions,"" he said. Uncertain Future The cordial tone of last night's debate is probably due to the fact that the gubernatorial election campaign is informally already under way, giving rise to fears for the future of pacification. Rio's state election is very much up for grabs; Governor Cabral's alliance with city mayor Eduardo Paes has fallen apart, and the one with President Dilma Rousseff (herself up for reelection) is also shaky. Her Workers' Party is bent on fielding its own candidate, Senator Lindbergh Farias, instead of supporting Cabral's party's choice, Vice-governor Luiz Fernando ""Pezao"" de Souza. Meanwhile, other candidates have joined the fray, making the most of Cabral's fragility. Beltrame helped Cabral to an easy reelection in 2010. But now, in light of continuing street protests, his achievements are more vulnerable to criticism. Continuity is surely at risk. But last night, for most of those present, the value of the secretary's work was clear, as he enunciated his accomplishments: Entry exams for public safety workers, with 400 new recruits being produced a month. Reformulation of the police academy and its curriculum, particularly to reflect respect for and information about human rights. 8,600 pacification police, with officers circulating between the academy, the UPPs and normal police work. (These officers are part of a total force of about 50,000 military police. Rio's civil police force, above all responsible for investigative work, comes to 12,000 officers. The total of 62,000 officers stands in contrast with the 34,526-person -- as of 2010 -- New York City police force, serving a population of 8 million. According to Beltrame, the narrow alleys of Rio's favelas require higher police density.) Increased police reports, as favela residents turn away from drug traffickers to resolve conflict, with, for example, a fourfold increase in numbers of citizens seeking help at the 15th precinct, in Gavea (near Rocinha). Increased arrests and fewer bullets being shot. In the 16th Battalion, in Bonsucesso (northern Rio), the police used 56,000 bullets in 2009. Last year, they used 2,000. 35 police pacification units, with only about four or five left to install, directly affecting about 500,000 residents -- a number which jumps to 1.5 million when residents of areas contiguous to pacification units are included. A formal redefinition of police work, away from warmongering, towards peacekeeping. Beltrame, who sees himself now ""shifting into fifth gear,"" noted that his strategic plan reaches beyond the end of Cabral's term, laying the groundwork for his successor. The question is who, if anyone, will use it. While OsteRio attendees, mostly South Zone residents, are willing to consider the subtleties of pacification in light of the chaotic policy that preceded it, this may not be the case with most of the state's voters. ""The UPP isn't a solution, it's a possibility,"" noted ISER's Pedro Strozemberg. ""It's a watershed."" *Reprinted with permission from Julia Michaels, a reporter who has lived in Rio for over a decade and writes a blog, Rio Real , in English and Portuguese.

"What an Ex-General Wants to Teach Honduras Police: Interview. Retired military General Julian Pacheco, who began serving as Honduras' new minister of security this year, faces some big challenges in the Central American country, the most violent in the region. But even with his military background, in an exclusive interview with InSight Crime, Pacheco says he is ""not here"" to teach Honduras' police ""war tactics."" Pacheco is the first non-civilian to serve as security ministry since the department's creation in 1998. The ministry oversees law enforcement and policing in the country, and the selection of Pacheco -- who is the former head of an anti-crime, multi-agency task force known as FUSINA, and who also once worked in military intelligence -- formed part of a wider pattern of military appointments in civilian posts. This prompted some concerns that Honduras was leaning too heavily on its military when it came to citizen security issues. InSight Crime recently talked with Pacheco in Honduras about his priorities as security minister, how he sees the state of organized crime in the country, and his views on how to best strengthen a police force that has long struggled with corruption. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Click on the highlighted sections throughout the article to hear Pacheco speak. What is your list of priorities in the security ministry? The first is resolving the issue of criminal investigation, which is a problem that the country has, not the police. So we need to strengthen the criminal investigative police and that's priority number one. The second priority is the system of police intelligence, and more human resources for police intelligence. The third important issue is the logistical side of the police: more vehicles, more technology so that they can do their job. And the last would be a reclassification of their personnel. Those are the four priorities we've established. There's been some high-level drug trafficking cases [in Honduras recently]. How have you managed to achieve what previous governments weren't able to do? What you have done differently that you haven't done before? When it comes to security, political decisions are a big factor. You can have an institution that's very well equipped, very trained, very capable. But if there's no political will to resolve a strategic, national problem like drug trafficking, you're not going to go anywhere. That's why it's been the decision of this president to say, ""We're going to fight these criminal bands because they're generating a lot of violence and a lot of bloodshed in the country."" Have you encountered any resistance, any problems? What's been the most difficult part of attacking these high-level groups? Firstly, it's been the vulnerability of security institutions: the police, the attorney general, the [Supreme] Court, the courts. It's not news or surprising to anyone that in regions like the west (of Honduras), the prosecutor or the judge or the police officer who maybe doesn't act in favor of the interests of these groups, they would be too afraid to do so. Because these groups have so many resources, they can be sure to take revenge for any kind of harm that a prosecutor or judge could do to them. ""If the drugs are going to go through, it's going to go through, but we don't want this country to be a stage for drug trafficking."" So that was why [the position of] the federal-level prosecutor was created. A prosecutor based in Tegucigalpa who has the power to act in the west. The federal judges as well. So these [criminal groups] could buy off the local authorities, but they didn't have the national ones. And that unbalanced them, and they began to lose control, and that's what has permitted us to achieve the things that we have. And alongside that, the US government is supporting us with a lot of information, and that was also a political decision, to accept that aid. Have you seen any changes in the dynamics of the underworld in the last 18 months? Yes. The number of narco-flights arriving in our country have been noticeably reduced. The amount of drugs arriving by sea, by land, have been reduced as well. We know that drugs are moving through, we don't presume to defeat organized crime. What we want is to establish order in the country. And in establishing order in the country, we're going to push them out to find out routes. If the drugs are going to go through, it's going to go through, but we don't want this country to be a stage for drug trafficking, either nationally or internationally. Gangs and Violence How can you confront the gang issue in Honduras? Well, we've created special units. The country has an anti-gang unit run by the national police. There's an anti-extortion unit that specifically combats extortion, which is the main source of funding for the gangs. But on top of that we've created special units for prevention. So we're going down two paths: undermining their control of physical spaces where they control the population, and also undermining popular support for these gangs, because it's also important to reduce the social base where they can recruit new members. Have you been able to establish whether these same gangs have become more sophisticated in the past few years? Do they have better weaponry? ""The gang issue isn't one we're going to resolve in a year."" We don't think so, because we've taken down much of the logistical capacity they once had. We've fought them hard. We've fought the issue of arms trafficking, the issue of car robberies, and also the issue of gangs occupying civilian infrastructure in some parts of the country, we've recuperated whole areas. It's still a problem, because the gang issue isn't one we're going to resolve in a year. It's a process that will maybe take several administrations, but this administration has started it. Do you think gangs are responsible for the majority of homicides in the country? A great deal. The other is the issue of drug trafficking and gang rivalries, the infamous ""tumbes"" [robberies] of drug shipments, the infamous lack of loyalty among gangs that brings about the infamous massacres. But then there's also [violence] generated by gangs specifically related to the drug issue - the control of territory for dealing drugs. What's the relationship between gangs and transnational organized crime? Well, more than anything it's one of high-impact assassinations. That's where you going to see the participation of a group of gangs - gangs that already have a certain amount of training and experience -- who become involved with drug trafficking gangs, or other criminal groups not necessarily involved in drug trafficking. And [the gangs] are paid to kill someone off, in what's known as sicariato. Police Reform and Militarization of Security One primordial, ongoing issue is police reform. Honduras has been working on this issue for nearly two decades, and they just haven't been able to do it. Well, I think I've been lucky enough to identify a group of police officials who want to recuperate their police force, because I'm a retired officer of the armed forces. And these institutions [police and military] can only recover from these problems if the will comes from within - the commitment to do it. From outside it's impossible - why? Because these are hierarchal institutions that have a structure, internal codes that only they understand, and sometimes the people on the outside don't understand them. Why? Because this is a career. The police officer who enters the police academy knows he has 35 years of service ahead of him. So he fights for that. The military man is the same. So what I've done is identify a group of officials who want to work with the Ministry on this issue of strengthening the police, saving the police, and recuperating the image of the police in the public eye. ""Why do presidents use ex-military on these issues? Because it's an issue of knowledge, experience, and loyalty to the country."" One debate right now is that there's a lot of military and ex-military in leadership positions when it comes to citizen security. How do you see this, from the inside, when there's talk of the militarization of citizen security? Looking at the police issue - why do presidents use ex-military on these issues? Because it's an issue of knowledge, experience, and loyalty to the country, and presidents see a military man as a technocrat, a technocrat in his work, in the specific areas that they want to improve. So I see this as an opportunity to serve the country in a transitional phase. Possibly in one, two, three administrations, the minister of security will be a police general. Perhaps you're bringing broader experience than others, but the concern is that you're also bringing a military mentality. The idea that there should be more focus on prevention or occupation of territory rather than the investigative part. So the concern is that a military mentality will be imposed upon the police, which maybe needs a different mindset to confront the country's problems. I do come with a technical mentality, that's true. In three ways - the first is the mentality of fomenting a hierarchy in the police, given that a hierarchy lets you foment discipline, institutional commitment, and solidarity between those very police. The second is creating connections between the base-level police officers, and the higher-ranking officers. So you're creating a connection between these ranks, so that there's a responsibility of leadership. So we are trying to recuperate the leadership of the police in such a way so that there's a link between the police general, and those who are out in the streets, because that hasn't existed before. And the other issue we want to look at is planning. There's a lot of inefficiency when it comes to police planning long-term planning, planning of operations, and tactical planning too. So if you don't know how define your objectives, you don't really know where you're going. But if you can define objectives, then you have an order - an order for employing your human, financial, logistical and legal resources. So that's what we're trying to teach [the police] - I know they already have an order, but it needs to be structured. ""A policeman isn't a soldier I'm not here to teach them war tactics."" And the other issue is one of logistics - how to adequately manage logistics in order to be functional, and so that your operations are successful. For example, this can involve things as basic as knowing vehicle maintenance -- as basic as knowing how much munitions the police need for training this year, how many weapons, what kinds of weapons they need. They don't need weapons of war because a policeman isn't a soldier. He's a civilian dressed in uniform who goes around with a rifle, with a badge, to serve the citizenry I'm not here to teach them war tactics, or operational tactics, or aerial transport tactics, or special forces. Nevertheless, the police need special forces, but special forces with other characteristics, not the special forces that a military structure has. You say that this is a transitory era, but at the same time there's talk of putting the military police in the constitution. So I don't know if those two things are compatible. That's a political decision of the current president, but I'm going to give you an example. In Spain, there are three police bodies: there's the civil guard, which is a militarized police, there's the national police, and there's the investigative bodies. The civil guard is practically an army in Spanish. Argentina has one too, in the Gendarmerie. Brazil has its military police. Having just one institution in charge of public security, we run the risk that what happened to our police over the past decade will happen again. [We need] another institution as a counterweightAt the end of the day what the public is interested in is that we give them security, that there's someone to look after them, someone to call during an emergency that will help them. If it's military police, a citizen isn't really interested - what he's interested in is getting a response when he wants help. You used to manage FUSINA, you had a hand in intelligence, now you run the Ministry of Security. You also had access to phone wiretaps. Some from the outside might see pretty strong concentration of power here. How do you see it from the inside? I don't think that's something worth worrying about. I don't have as much power as people credit me with because it's not true. Plus the only power I can have is the experience I've managed to accumulate over a 35-year career. "	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"The Familia Responds to Death of Top Leader. The Familia Michoacana -- the criminal syndicate whose battles this week with authorities in their western stronghold from which they take their name has left them without a leader following the death of Nazario Moreno -- has issued a statement directed at the Mexican government and the Michoacan people, which InSight Crime has translated. The statement, published on the Blog del Narco website, which receives and publishes posts about the drug war in Mexico, and could not be independently verified, threatens Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who is from Michoacan, and his family. It also says more battles with authorities may be coming, telling Michoacan residents, ""Do not go to hospitals, do not go shopping, watch TV and stay at home please."" Full version: Beware Felipe Calderon, pray to the Holy Ghost, because we bring the blessing of our God. Nazario our God, may God rest his soul. This is not over until the Familia Michoacana dies. And the Pumas, the Bravos, the Leones, the Resistencia, the 5-5, the Elites, the LF, the CHAYITO, the Machitos, the Beast, the X, the A's, and many more will not die. We will come for Calderon and his whole fucking family, we know they're in Michoacan and recognize that Cheran, Capacuaro, Cheranastico, La Arantepacua, La Mohonera, Nuevo Morelos, are with us. This is not narco-terrorism, this is a guerrilla war, and it is the war for peace and the federal forces of Michoacan, Don Juan de Arantepacua has his people and we will give our lives for all, salutations. MESSAGE TO MICHOACAN Do not panic, try not to go out on the street so the federal pigs can't disrespect you and to stay clear of stray bullets and more stray bullets. Do not go to hospitals, do not go shopping, watch TV and stay at home please. Atte. La Familia Michoacana, Phantom 6 and Bravo 6.

So they have all the facts, we tell them who the leaders of the Familia are, so they don't mislead people and tell more lies. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Bolivia Targets Brazilian Prison Gangs Cocaine Trafficking Network. Anti-narcotics police in Bolivia have revealed that Brazil's PCC prison gang controls cocaine trafficking routes throughout the country, and are now on the hunt for a man they claim is the PCC's chief contact in Bolivia. According to Gonzalo Quezada, head of Bolivia's Special Anti-Narcotics Police (FELCN), the Sao Paulo-based gang known as the First Capital Command (PCC) obtains much of the cocaine it sells in Brazil via a network of drug flights based out of Bolivia. Quezada told La Razon newspaper that drugs originating in Peru are loaded onto small planes and transported to eastern Bolivia, before being flown to Brazil. Quezada also claimed that Bolivian authorities had identified the PCC's Sebastiao Spencer as the individual behind the gang's ""air bridge."" Although Spencer has been arrested several times, he has consistently been released under suspicious circumstances, according to La Razon. The last time he was arrested, in November 2011, he walked free despite being caught red-handed attempting to smuggle 150 kilograms of cocaine into Brazil along with four companions. The PCC's presence in Bolivia is the latest indication of the group's growing influence in the region. Officials in Brazil have said that the gang, which began in Sao Paulo prisons, now has active cells in 22 of Brazil's 27 states. The revelation that it is also involved in a relatively large-scale transnational drug trafficking operation spanning three countries is another illustration of the PCC's sophistication and oranizational capacity. Quezada's announcement highlights just one side of Bolivia's importance to the Brazilian drug trade. Even though the Peru-Bolivia-Brazil route is becoming increasingly popular among drug smugglers, eastern Bolivia, -- particularly the province of Santa Cruz -- is emerging as a major drug trafficking hub in its own right. In fact, Brazilian government officials claim that just 38 percent of cocaine sold in their country can be traced back to Peru originally, while 54 percent comes from Boliva."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Zetas Boss Only Identified After Body was Stolen. Mexican officials didn't identify Heriberto Lazcano, alias "" Z-3 ,"" until after they had killed him and his body had been stolen, in a testament to the low profile maintained by the Zetas leader. On October 10, navy spokesperson Rear Admiral Jose Luis Vergara told local press that Lazcano had only been identified after his death , and that authorities initially believed him to be a low-level criminal. This explains why his body and that of an accomplice were left in a funeral parlor in Progreso, Coahuila, where the shooting took place. The Coahuila state attorney general said that a group of armed men then broke into the building hours after Lazcano's death and forced the funeral parlor's director to drive the bodies away in a hearse. It was only after the bodies had been snatched that police matched fingerprints and photos of one of the corpses to Lazcano, and the government announced the Zeta boss' death. It is not altogether surprising that Lazcano was not identified until after his death. There were few known images of the Zetas boss, and the Mexican marines who killed him were responding to a tip about armed men attending a baseball game in Progreso. A well-known Zetas commander, it was thought that Lazcano had been taking refuge overseas, with rumors that he had spent time in Guatemala , so finding him in Coahuila was unexpected. Lazca's small entourage was also uncharacteristic for a major drug cartel leader. Officials say he was with only two accomplices when he was killed. As InSight Crime reported in February, Lazca had prepared a lavish tomb for himself , a tacky modernist structure in Hidalgo state (see photo, above). His remains, however, do not seem to have been laid to rest there. Quinta Columna reports that the cemetery where the tomb was built had not received any requests for burials."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"El Chapos Wife Gives Birth in Los Angeles. The wife of fugitive Mexican Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquin Guzman, alias ""El Chapo,"" gave birth to twins at a hospital in Los Angeles County, California. The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that Emma Coronel, a former beauty queen, crossed the border into California in mid-July and gave birth to daughters on August 15 at a hospital in Lancaster before returning to Mexico. U.S. authorities tracked Coronel, who holds U.S. citizenship, as she traveled from Mexico to the United States and back. She has no pending criminal charges against her, however, and was not arrested. Coronel is believed to be the third wife of Guzman, who is one of the world's most wanted criminals and has been on the run since escaping from a Mexican jail in 2001. The couple were married in an elaborate ceremony in 2007 in the north-central state of Durango, on the day of her 18th birthday. On the birth certificates of the twins, Coronel is named as the mother, but the space for father was left blank. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"UN Chastises Guatemala on Militarization of Security. The United Nations has criticized Guatemala's increasingly militarized approach to combating insecurity, a rebuke that could easily be applied to other countries in Central America's Northern Triangle region. The military has taken on a larger role in citizen security in Guatemala, but ""this has not resulted in visible improvements,"" according to the UN Human Rights Council's annual report on Guatemala ( pdf ), released in January 2015. ""The persistent insecurity in the country is worrying,"" UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Flavia Pansieri, stated on March 25 while presenting the report, according to EFE. ""It is unfortunate that the government's response has been focused until now on the militarization of public security."" The report noted how attempted homicides have increased in two areas of Guatemala City by 38 percent and 5 percent, respectively, despite the deployment of joint military and police task forces to these areas in 2012. Prior to the deployments, murder attempts in these zones were on the decline. The report also stated the use of army squads for public security has expanded from just two to 12 out of Guatemala's 22 departments over the past two years. President Otto Perez increased the role of the armed forces in fighting crime soon after assuming office in 2012. Two years later, the national homicide rate increased for the first time since 2009, feeding concerns that this military deployment could have contributed to the uptick in violence. While homicides subsequently dropped nine points in 2014, the UN report suggests that it is unlikely that Guatemala's use of the military contributed to this. Guatemala has also expanded the military's role in fighting organized crime by installing three military bases in major drug trafficking border zones. The government also replaced police with a specialized military brigade in San Marcos province, the country's most prolific poppy-growing region. The other Northern Triangle nations -- Honduras and El Salvador -- have also relied on a militarized, aggressive approach to combating organized crime. Since taking office in January 2014, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez has increased the number of troops in the country's military police force, and attempted to enshrine the unit into the constitution , despite concerns these measures could lead to greater human rights violations. In El Salvador, security forces have responded to rising violence following the breakdown of the country's 2012 gang truce with increasingly aggressive tactics ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Messi Latest Soccer Star Embroiled in Drug Trafficking Scandal. The father of Argentina and Barcelona soccer star Lionel Messi is under investigation for laundering drug money, in the latest scandal offering evidence that ties between organized crime and soccer have spread from Latin America to Europe. The Central Operations Unit (UCO) of Spain's Civil Guard has opened an investigation into allegations Jorge Messi, father and finance manager to one of the world's most prominent soccer players, is on the payroll of Colombian drug traffickers reported El Mundo. Jorge Messi stands accused of laundering money by staging major charitable events and manipulating so-called ""Row Zero"" tickets, whereby people paid for tickets without the intention of attending because the money was for charity. According to El Mundo, the sale of such tickets was carried out in a manner impossible to track. Jorge Messi is accused of taking a cut of between ten and 20 percent of the money being laundered. The events include the recent ""Messi and Friends"" tour, which saw the superstar visit international locations to play in charity matches alongside other world famous players, reported El Mundo. The Messi and Friends tour passed through Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami, as well as the Peruvian capital Lima, and Cancun in Mexico, before ending in Colombia's second-largest city, Medellin, during the summer of 2013. The Medellin game followed a similar match in Bogota in 2012, however organizers reported major financial losses due to poor attendance. Four current players for FC Barcelona -- Messi's club team -- have been questioned as part of the investigation: Messi himself; Javier Mascherano; Daniel Alves; and Jose Manuel Pinto. Should the investigation into Jorge Messi bring legal action and possible conviction, it would send shockwaves throughout the soccer world. However, it is not the first such case to surface recently. Jose Luis Perez Caminero, a former Spain international and current director of Atletico Madrid, is also subject of a money laundering investigation, and stands accused of having links to Mexican and Colombian organized crime. Such links between organized crime and soccer have long been common in Latin America -- just earlier this year, clubs in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile were raided and accused of being used as money laundering hubs. With two high profile scandals now hitting Spanish soccer in quick succession, this could be an indication Latin American organized crime is now also establishing a presence within one of the most highly regarded soccer leagues in the world, which would help launder the proceeds from the European drug market -- a revenue source of growing importance."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Brazilian Police Arrested After Murder of Sao Paulo Teens. Eight Sao Paulo military police have been arrested following the release of video footage showing the murder of two adolescents, in what appears to be an example of the type of extrajudicial killings that have provoked conflict with Brazil gangs and caused controversy throughout the country. The video, picked up by CCTV security cameras on March 16, shows the 14 and 18-year-old boys being shot from behind more than ten times by helmeted men after rasing their hands in surrender and facing the wall. A third youth is shown escaping the scene. (See video below; warning: extreme violence depicted; minors should not watch unaccompanied by an adult.) Seconds later, a military police car is seen speeding by. But a second camera shows the car was parked on the corner, within meters and viewing distance of the attack. Authorities believe the killers to have been police, based on the positioning of the police car and testimony from a person who was on the phone with one of the victims at the time of the attack, reported the BBC. Extrajudicial police killings are an ongoing concern in Brazil, where police are widely distrusted. According to Human Rights Watch , Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo police combined are responsible for over 1,000 ""resistance"" killings per year, in which they murder victims and later report that they were resisting arrest. In July 2012, a series of killings by police appeared to be revenge for police murders by Sao Paulo's First Capital Command (PCC), which is engaged in an ongoing conflict with police."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
New Police Unit to Tackle Drug Dealing in Mexico City. Mexico City's police are set to launch a new special unit dedicated to combating drug dealing in the capital, in an effort to clamp down on the country's biggest domestic drug market. According to a spokesperson from the Federal District Secretary of Public Security (SSP-DF), the group will be composed of 200 officers, who are still being trained, reported El Universal. The unit will work in conjunction with Mexico City's Attorney General's Office, gathering intelligence and searching homes that are suspected to be involved in small scale drug dealing. Officials said that intelligence would be used to construct a map of properties used to store and move drugs, reported Milenio. InSight Analysis Mexico City has so far been spared the high levels of drug-related violence seen in other parts of the country. As InSight Crime has noted previously , the city is the base for the federal security forces as well as the home to the country's elites, who are unlikely to allow violence to rise in their home city. It also benefits from a de facto truce between cartels, allowing some cartel leaders to live in the city peacefully. When announcing the launch of the new unit, officials said there had been no reports of cells linked to organized crime currently operating in Mexico City. However, in 2011, a police report obtained by the Mexican press suggested that seven cartels, including the Sinaloa Cartel, the Zetas and the Familia Michoacana, had established a presence in the city and were involved in drug dealing and trafficking, extortion, contract killing, synthetic drug production and human trafficking. As the country's biggest domestic drug market -- which has grown rapidly in recent years and represents a significant revenue source for criminal groups -- the city is a lucrative proposition for criminal groups. While the new force may be focusing on small time drug dealing, it could face more powerful adversaries if it is true that the cartels are already present in the city.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Ex-DEA Official Details Zetas Texas Border Gun Smuggling. A former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) official has said that Mexican drug gang the Zetas buys weapons in Dallas and flies them to El Paso, before taking them over the border into Mexico. According to The El Paso Times , Phil Jordan, a former head of the DEA's El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) and CIA operative, revealed details of the group's arms trafficking operations. ""They are purchasing weapons in the Dallas area and are flying them to El Paso, and then they are taking them across the border into Juarez,"" the former DEA agent told the paper. Jordan, who works as a consultant but reportedly still has contact with active law enforcement officers, also noted that the arrangement was ""ironic,"" because the same airport used by the cartel, the Alliance Airport, is also the site of the DEA's Aviation Operations Center (see map below). View Zetas Smuggling Weapons Across U.S. Border in a larger map This claim was echoed by Robert Plumlee, a former contract pilot for the CIA, who said that the Zetas have purchased property in the Columbus-Palomas border region in New Mexico which they use as a safehouse for weapons and other illicit goods. Plumlee also said he had attended a June debriefing with U.S. Border Patrol agents, in which they discussed concerns that the Zetas may have bought weapons through a U.S. government program. ""From the intel, it appears that a company was set up in Mexico to purchase weapons through the U.S. Direct Commercial Sales program, and that the company may have had a direct link to the Zetas,"" said Plumee. The U.S. State Department's Direct Commercial Sales program was set up to oversee private weapons sales to foreign firms. According to the defense monitoring website Just the Facts , the program provided $416.5 million in equipment and services to Mexico in 2010. These allegations came just two weeks after a captured Zetas commander claimed that the group obtains all of its weapons in the United States. In an interview recorded by Mexico's Ministry of Public Safety, Jesus Enrique Rejon, alias ""El Mamito"" told officials that his group used to take weapons across the U.S. border through checkpoints, but a security crackdown forced them to smuggle arms across the Rio Grande. He also said that the Zetas' rivals in the Gulf Cartel have an easier time bringing weapons across the border. ""It got harder, but we can still get them,"" Rejon said. ""Those in the Gulf Cartel get them a lot easier; we don't know why. It's impossible to buy them and smuggle them in a vehicle trunk, but they do it. There must be a deal somewhere. I don't know."" As InSight Crime has previously reported , U.S. law enforcement officials have become increasingly concerned about the Zetas' penetration into the country, especially in Midwest and Southeastern states. The Zetas are generally perceived as the most brutal of Mexico's drug gangs, due in part to the fact that they lack the criminal infrastructure to organize systemic large-scale drug shipments like many of their competitors. Instead, it is thought that the group obtains much of its profit through the more violent activities of kidnapping and extortion. So if Plumlee and Jordan's claims are correct, it could represent an ominous sign for U.S. law enforcement agents, who have long warned of ""spillover violence"" along the border. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
160,000 Mexicans Displaced in 2011, Most by Drug Violence: UN. A new report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees says 160,000 people were internally displaced in Mexico last year, most of them as a result of the drug war, an often-overlooked dimension of the country's public security crisis. The states that saw the highest rates of displacement were Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Durango, Sinaloa, Michoacan and Guerrero -- all among the worst hit by drug violence. The report estimates that 24,500 people fled Ciudad Juarez alone. The report criticizes the Mexican government's response to the problem, noting that its military approach to organized crime does not include a strategy to deal with internal refugees. The UN's High Commissioner for Refugees said in a press conference that the Mexican government had not recognised the existence of refugees displaced by the war on drugs, reports Frontera. Internal displacement is an impact of Mexico's drug war that is often overlooked. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Center said in a December 2011 report that refugees within the state of Chihuahua continued to face violence after uprooting, and that small business owners who fled to Veracruz from Chihuahua and Michoacan were still targeted by organized criminal groups there. The displaced have difficulty finding employment; in the central Mexican state of Queretaro, around 60 percent of job applications are reportedly made by refugees from the north. In addition to internal displacement, Mexico's high rates of violence have forced people to flee abroad, leading more and more to seek asylum in the US. From 2006 to 2008 the number of Mexicans seeking asylum in the US as a result of violence increased 50-fold. The vast majority are turned away. In fiscal year 2010, less than 50 of Mexico's 3,231 asylum seekers were accepted , according to the US Department of Justice's statistics. Still, despite the large number of people affected, Mexico has a long way to go before its level of displacement is anything like that of Colombia. Comparisons are often made between the two countries' struggles against drug trafficking. In the South American country, the internal conflict is thought to have displaced more than 10 percent of the population, compared to some 0.2 percent for Mexico. 	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Arrests Suggest Crooked Cops Are Aiding PCCs Expansion in Paraguay. The arrest of an alleged Brazilian crime boss, a purported collaborator and a policeman working as a bodyguard in Paraguay's capital city illustrates how police corruption and sophisticated tactics may be facilitating the expansion of Brazil's most powerful crime group. Paraguayan authorities arrested Eduardo Aparecido de Almeida, alias ""Pisca,"" an alleged leader of the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC), on July 18 in Paraguay's capital Asuncion. Paraguay's Attorney General's Office identifies Pisca as the second-in-command for the PCC's Paraguayan faction known as ""Raio X,"" while the country's National Anti-Drug Secretariat (Secretaria Nacional Antidrogas - SENAD) call him the group's "" regional boss ."" The two Paraguayan institutions collaborated with Brazil's federal police in the investigation that lead to Pisca's arrest. Lorena Ledesma, the Paraguayan prosecutor leading the investigation, told Paraguay's Radio 970 AM program that Pisca was living for at least a month in a ""very secure home"" in Asuncion with closed-circuit monitoring of the blocks surrounding the luxury property, which had been rented using false personal documents. These security cameras alerted Pisca to the arrival of authorities, but when he attempted to flee on foot, SENAD officials apprehended him. According to Ledesma, Pisca is an ""active member"" of the PCC in charge of ""coordinating the connections"" between the Brazilian group and counterparts in Bolivia and Paraguay for the trafficking of drugs. News outlet ABC Color reported that Paraguayan authorities suspect that Pisca may have been involved in dividing up the more than $11 million stolen by the PCC in a sophisticated commando-style heist in the border city Ciudad del Este last year. ABC's sources suggest that Pisca may have fled from Brazil with his family a few months ago seeking refuge in Asuncion after tensions exploded between PCC members over the distribution of the money. Paraguayan authorities quickly moved to extradite Pisca to Brazil, where he is wanted for his alleged involvement in crimes ranging from drug trafficking and criminal association, to kidnapping and homicide, as well as for escaping a Sao Paulo prison. And within the same day of his arrest, Pisca was turned over to Brazil's federal police. In addition, authorities arrested another Brazilian national identified as Ricardo Moraes Alves, described as a ""close collaborator"" of the alleged PCC boss. Carlos Alfredo Mendoza, a Paraguayan national police officer, was also arrested on accusations of serving as Pisca's personal body guard and ""providing his identification documents to the Brazilian so that he could move around the city,"" Ledesma told Radio 970 AM. Following Mendoza's arrest, the commissioner and deputy commissioner of his police unit were discharged pending investigation because Mendoza was scheduled to be on duty at the time authorities apprehended him. The arrest of an alleged PCC leader in Paraguay's capital far from the border with Brazil may indicate that the powerful criminal organization is deepening its penetration into the neighboring country with the help of corrupt police officers. The PCC have been battling in recent years to establish strongholds in towns like Pedro Juan Caballero and Ciudad del Este in Paraguay's eastern marijuana-producing region bordering Brazil, possibly by sub-contracting local groups as well as sending Brazilian members. But Pisca's arrest marks the first time Paraguayan authorities have tracked down a presumed PCC leader in the capital, which sits closer to the country's western border with Argentina. The seeming expansion of the PCC beyond the strategically important border region appears to have been facilitated by collusion with members of the country's national police force, which has a long history of corruption. According to Paraguayan authorities, Pisca was likely able to enter the country with false identification documents, rented an upscale mansion and moved around Asuncion with ease using his police partner's own identity. This is also likely how he evaded police attention for several months. It's unclear how Pisca's arrest will impact the PCC's operations in Paraguay, particularly because authorities are not clear what his exact role in the group was. However, if recent developments in Pedro Juan Caballero are any indication, new PCC crime bosses are typically ready to step in following arrests to maintain strongholds."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Chihuahua Attorney General Opens Juarez Human Trafficking Investigation. An anti-human trafficking coalition identified a number of possible prostitution recruitment centers throughout Ciudad Juarez this week, prompting the Chihuahua State Attorney General's office to launch its first-ever investigation of human trafficking in the city. The investigation is a direct response to a complaint filed Monday by a coalition of human rights organizations, including the State Commission of Human Rights, regarding the 2009 disappearance of 17-year old Jessica Terranzas (photo above). Terranzas left her home in December of 2009 to look for work, but was never heard from again. According to Ciudad Juarez's El Diario , human trafficking has long been a concern in the city, but advocates lacked concrete evidence to bring the matter to authorities. The complaint alleges that delinquents ""hooked"" teenage girls looking for work in the city's downtown area, posting misleading wanted ads in clubs, bakeries, internet cafes, and even schools. Human trafficking and child abduction are becoming increasingly common in Mexico, as drug cartels diversify their criminal portfolios. Human trafficking, kidnapping and extortion are on the rise as gangs look to increase their earnings as drug interdiction efforts by both the Mexican and United States governments are stepped up. Last month, the president of Mexico's Association of Missing and Stolen Children estimated that the country has more than 50,000 child abductees , referring to the country as the ""Bangkok of Latin America."" There are suggestions that human trafficking is now the third most lucrative industry in the world. Both the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels are currently fighting for control of Ciudad Juarez, which saw a record murder rate last year. According to testimony by Edgar Valdez Villarreal, alias ""La Barbie,"" arrested in August 2010 in Mexico City, the two organizations were once allied. In 2007, however, Sinaloa boss Joaquin Guzman, alias "" El Chapo ,"" broke his pact with Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, alias "" El Viceroy ,"" of the Juarez cartel and killed Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes, Vicente's brother. The resulting feud turned Ciudad Juarez into the most violent battleground in Mexico. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Central Americas Street Gangs Find Space to Grow in Milan. Milan is known the world over for its high-end fashion and design, but a new report brings attention to a much less favorable label the city has acquired as the European stronghold of Central America's hyper-violent Barrio 18 and MS13 street gangs. MS13 and Barrio 18 factions based in Milan are carrying out acts of violence and are becoming a public safety concern for the police and the Salvadoran expatriate community, reported El Mundo. Deidamia Calderon, who moved to Milan in the 1970s to work as a maid, told the newspaper how her community is changing as a result of the gangs. ""This year we were afraid to celebrate Independence Day in a park,"" Calderon said, adding that extra police presence was required for the September 11 festivities. ""The gangshave been introduced silently and no one knows how many of them are now around us."" According to El Mundo, there are currently 15 gang members being held in the Milanese Bollate Prison for murder, attempted murder, or aggravated violence. Much of the violence is directed towards other gang members. Salvadoran news outlet El Faro recounted one particularly bloody example from 2008, when a football match devolved into a violent battle between the two gangs. A young man was severely beaten and lost one eye. However, gang-related crime appears appears to be spreading outside the Salvadoran community. In June 2015, several gang members attacked a train inspector with a machete, reported El Mundo. The attack nearly left the man without his right arm. Anna Viola and Gianluigi Pino, a social worker and a psychologist who work with incarcerated gang members, say Salvadoran youths who struggle to adapt to their new settings are vulnerable to being taken in by a gang. ""They are young people who came to Italy when they were 13 or 14 years old through a process of family reunification,"" Viola said. ""Many did not want to come here and met an unwelcome environment: a mother whom they only knew from Skype, a foreign language and culture, and a cold climate."" ""These are guys who cannot find a place in society and seek to identify with something,"" continued Pino. ""The gang becomes their family."" Central American-based gangs in Italy is not a new phenomenon; according to Conte, the first evidence of MS13 members being active in Milan surfaced in 2005 or 2006. The gangs in Italy have mimicked many of the same cultural and organizational norms as their counterparts in El Salvador. Even the Barrio 18 split between the Surenos and Revolucionarios factions has been mimicked in Italy, albeit at a delayed pace. In both 2013 and 2015 , the Italian State Police launched raids against the MS13 in Milan, arresting over a dozen gang members in each instance. Italy is a natural landing spot and recruiting ground for gang members because of the large Salvadoran expatriate community there. With an estimated 40,000 Salvadorans living just in Milan and its surroundings, this represents the largest concentration of Salvadorans outside of the Western Hemisphere. According to El Mundo, Salvadoran women began migrating to Milan to work as domestic servants in the 1970s. Many decided to stay as their home country devolved into civil war. Eventually, they brought over their husbands, brothers, and sons, who were fleeing the war. Now, however, the migrants reaching Milan are often fleeing the gang violence that helped turn El Salvador into the most homicidal country in the world last year."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
US Busts Mexico-New Jersey Prostitution Ring. United States authorities have arrested 13 people accused of involvement in a network that forced Mexican women into sexual slavery in New York and New Jersey, underlining how the US remains a major trafficking destination for victims from Mexico and the region. Federal agents arrested the suspects and rescued the women upon raiding four brothels in Yonkers, Queens, Poughkeepsie, and Newburgh. According to prosecutors , the network exploited dozens of women, who were brought mainly from Tenancingo, in Tlaxcala state, near Mexico City. The women were allegedly enticed to the US with promises of a better life, but upon arrival were subjected to threats and sexual abuse and forced into prostitution. Some were brought to farms in New Jersey where they were forced to have sexual relations with as many as 25 farmworkers each day, while others worked in brothels in poor areas of New York City. Tenancingo is a major sex trafficking center, with approximately 1,000 of its 10,000 residents involved in the trade, according to BBC. The town's traffickers lure women from various parts of Mexico on romantic pretenses or with promises of a better life. Many women are initially trafficked to Mexico City and from there to the US, with Queens, New York one common destination. While human smuggling and migrant kidnapping have traditionally been Mexico's major problem in this area, human trafficking has also become a serious issue. In 2012, a Mexican congresswoman claimed that 800,000 Mexican adults and 20,000 children are trafficked each year for sexual exploitation, while a prominent human rights group identified 15 states in Mexico as human trafficking centers in 2011. A 2012 Congressional Research Service report stated that the US is one of five primary destination countries for Latin American sex trafficking victims, with Spain, Italy, Portugal, and Japan as the other four.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Are Northern Triangle Countries Narco-States?Mexico's and other countries' criminal organizations have increasingly solidified their presence in Central America's Northern Triangle, taking control of large swathes of land, co-opting officials and using front businesses to cover their illegal tracks, leading one prominent US researcher to ask the question: have these states given themselves up completely to criminal interests? In a draft paper for a National Defense University journal, former Washington Post reporter and International Assessment and Strategy Center (IASC) fellow Douglas Farah argues that Mexican transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) have consolidated in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, also known as the Northern Triangle, to the extent that they have become the de facto authority, making the state ""almost non-functional."" [ Read the paper here pdf. Disclosure: InSight Crime co-director Steven Dudley also contributed reporting to this paper. ] In Farah's view, this has the potential to turn the Northern Triangle countries into criminal, rather than simply weak, states. His key points include: 1. Real power now rests with the TCOs and their allies. Mexican criminal groups have co-opted already weak government structures in the three countries through contacts in corrupt security, justice and government bodies. This in turn has paved the way for the entry of other TCOs such as Colombian guerrillas from the FARC, the Spanish separatist group ETA, and even Hezbollah. ""There are virtually no 'ungoverned spaces' in the region,"" Farah writes. ""What has changed is that the authority is less and less often the state."" This is reflected in decreasing state resources and accessible to citizens, as well as citizen perceptions of state incompetence, Farah states. In contrast with the transport groups that existed in the Northern Triangle prior to the infiltration of Mexican criminal groups, the TCOs work to control territory, which they use to set up power bases and front businesses, including private security firms. According to Farah, territorial control is a key element of TCO power consolidation, allowing them to fulfill functions traditionally associated with the state. He notes that this is less true in El Salvador, where the street gangs, or ""maras,"" not the TCOs, have the most power. 2. The states themselves have allowed this power shift to happen. ""The state itself at times becomes a part of the criminal enterprise,"" writes Farah, adding that Central America's Northern Triangle is particularly attractive to criminal groups because TCOs are drawn to weak rather than failed states. While a failed state may have no real institutional structure to work with, weak state institutions provide the opportunity to co-opt security bodies, law enforcement officials, judicial officials, and politicians. Criminals work with the state through what Farah calls a ""transactional paradigm"" -- for example, police perform executions in exchange for money. According to Farah, this paradigm helps to explain ""anomalies"" present in these states, such as the persistence of extremely high homicide rates despite extremely high levels of incarceration. 3. The United States sees the risk, but is taking inappropriate measures. The United States recognizes that it will be affected by a loss of rule of law in Central America, not least because of the large amount of US-bound cocaine flowing through the region. However, the United States has continued to funnel money into anti-drug efforts in these corrupt, weak states, which are unable or unwilling to effectively use these funds, Farah says. The United States also lacks trustworthy public officials with whom to build relationships in these countries. Farah notes that the United States has helped directly contribute to the problem, deporting thousands of gang members back to these already weak and overburdened states. Meanwhile, Mexico and other Central American governments have increasingly shifted their focus to violence reduction over anti-drug efforts, a strategy which is arguably based on the assumption that large-scale criminal structures will always exist. The United States has also shifted policy somewhat, focusing more on economic and trade issues in the region. The question of whether the Northern Triangle nations -- particularly Honduras -- should justifiably be labeled ""narco"" or ""failed"" states has prompted plenty of debate. In 2011, a Costa Rican non-governmental organization (NGO) concluded that several Central American nations were at risk of becoming ""failed states"" -- with Honduras labeled the most at risk -- in an assessment based on the degree of economic insecurity and political turmoil within a given country. As noted by InSight Crime at the time, the very definition of what properly constitutes a ""failed"" state varies widely. It is clear that there are large sections of ""ungoverned spaces"" in Central America, where the state has lost its monopoly on the use of force. But as Farah argues, this is not the only problem: the governments in the Northern Triangle have already passed a ""tipping point"" in terms of controlling their territory. So great is the power of the TCOs that Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras are losing the ability to tackle their security problems in ways that strengthen the rule of law or the democratic process. Extremely low confidence in police and justice systems, evidenced by a proliferation of private security firms, is an indicator of the lack of state control in all of these countries. Up to 200,000 private security personnel are believed to be present in the Northern Triangle countries, significantly outnumbering police officers. In this context, the idea that TCOs use private security as a front business for illegal operations -- something previously noted by InSight Crime with regard to Honduras -- is troubling, and gives credence to the argument that it is not the government, but criminal groups, that exert the most influence over security issues. Farah's argument of a criminalized state is most plausible in Honduras, the country with the highest homicide rate in the world, where the police force has close links to organized crime , police investigate only 21 percent of crimes and even the country's attorney general resigned amidst calls for his impeachment over financial irregularities and incompetence. While Guatemala and El Salvador also face serious problems with corruption, the problem appears to be slightly less acute than in Honduras. One indicator of this is Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index , where Honduras ranked 133 out of 176 countries in 2012, while Guatemala scored 113 and El Salvador 83. There are small signs that all three Northern Triangle governments are making efforts to combat the wave of transnational crime, establish state legitimacy and reduce violence. In Guatemala, the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) has worked hard to tackle impunity and corruption, even opening investigations into 13 judges accused of issuing lenient sentences to drug traffickers. Honduras, meanwhile, is involved in an ongoing, if inefficient and problematic, police reform process , and in El Salvador, the truce between street gangs, despite its problems, is a bold anti-violence experiment. While these measures may not be sufficient, they should not be discounted completely. In the context of increasingly criminalized states, Farah recommends that the United States focus resources on understanding the new TCO paradigm and its economic implications, as well as reconsidering the nature of aid given to these countries. One possibility mentioned was focusing funds on the creation of small, screened, police units that communicate and cooperate effectively instead of sweeping reform. Regardless of the level of cooptation of Northern Triangle governments and security forces, the recommendation that the United States changes its aid paradigm is sensible. As noted by the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, much US technical assistance and equipment provided through the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) gets funneled into the countries' militaries, and the militaries are in turn being used to fulfill traditional police functions. This not only raises concerns related to corruption in the security forces, but also over human rights violations arising from the militarization of security. The question of whether the Northern Triangle countries can be considered genuine ""narco-states"" or ""failed states"" ultimately depends on the definitions used. However, what is clear is that these states are failing to provide citizens with even minimal levels of security and justice, and as the paper suggests, the biggest factor in this is the insidious and corrupting presence of organized crime."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Government Releases Plan To Reduce Violence. Several weeks after the El Salvador government announced it would not seek to restart talks of a truce between local gangs, a special security council released a 124-point action plan detailing how the government can act to slow the spread of violence in the country. The plan, which has not yet been released in full, would cost somewhere between $1.8 million and $2.1 billion and includes provisions to reduce youth unemployment, help victims of crimes, improve access to recreation and public spaces, and create reintegration programs for former prisoners. In all, nearly $1.5 billion would go towards crime prevention efforts, the government said. It also calls for $38 million in improvements in the penal system. Salvadoran prisons are chronically overcrowded, reaching a 325 percent occupancy level, according to the International Centre for Prison Studies. The special council, touted as an ""inter-institutional effort,"" is composed of members of the government and has some participation of civil society groups and multilaterals. Insight Crime Analysis The full budget for the plan, which is close to eight percent of the current annual GDP, would supposedly be raised from private and international sources, in addition to government funding. The question is where the money would come from. One of the plan's authors said that if financing could not be found, the special council would end up with ""good intentions, but no results,"" reported La Prensa Grafica. Historically, El Salvador has some of the lowest spending in social and education programs in the region. In 2011, government public investment represented 22 percent of GDP , while the Latin American average was 28 percent of its GDP. The action plan could be a response to the government's recent announcement to end negotiations to broker a truce between the country's two main gangs, the MS-13 and Barrio 18, and slow a surge in violence. The special council specifically recommended against allowing what one multilateral delegate called ""criminal elements"" a seat at the table. While unpopular among Salvadorans, the truce received credit for briefly lowering murder rates by nearly half. Since it broke down, homicides have gone up considerably making El Salvador one of the most violent countries in the world that is not at war."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"A Drug Traffickers Journey From a US Prison to Guatemala. A Guatemalan recently accused of laundering money for Honduran criminal network the Valles has a curious backstory: he previously served time in the US, and apparently returned to Guatemala to become a major operator in the cash smuggling trade. Ruben Arita Rivera, a Guatemalan national arrested on March 19 in the southern department of Chiquimula for money laundering, is no novice when it comes to organized crime. Rivera left a US prison four years earlier, after completing a sentence for drug trafficking in New York. Guatemala's Attorney General's Office links him to the seizure of $2.2 million in May 2014, and to a 30-kilo shipment of cocaine seized in the eastern department of Zacapa last February. An unofficial report says that US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents participated in his recent arrest in Guatemala, and that Arita was still on parole when he was captured. Nevertheless, the US Embassy in Guatemala did not confirm this. The US Embassy's spokesperson, Maureen Mimnaugh, said that the United States does not have an extradition request for Arita, according to the DEA office. As of March 19, the United States did not have any pending legal proceedings against Arita, but he is now once again on their radar. This article was originally published in Plaza Publica and was translated, edited, and reprinted with permission. See the Spanish original here. In 2008, Arita and other suspects conspired to distribute 500 grams of cocaine in New York, according to court documents from the Southern District of New York. According to one document, Arita received a package of cocaine in Spring Valley, New York, on March 5, 2008, the day of his capture. Despite the evidence against him, Arita (who hired a public defender) pleaded not guilty. But on January 12, 2009, after an abbreviated judicial procedure, he changed his plea. Ruben Arita Rivera served a prison term in the US before returning to Guatemala The judge Stephen C. Robinson sentenced Arita to 37 months in prison. The time he spent incarcerated while awaiting trial was counted as part of his sentence. He was supposed to leave prison on April 5, 2011, but documents from the Federal Bureau of Prisons show that he was freed on November 10, 2010. He was 44 years old (although Guatemalan police claim that is his current age, as of 2015). The New York court recommended three years of parole, starting when he was released from prison. During his three years on parole, Arita was prohibited from possessing a firearm, and had to provide DNA samples to his parole officer. Other demands required Arita to have a permanent, legal job, and not be in places where illicit drugs were distributed, consumed, used, or sold. He was also prohibited from having relationships with people involved in illegal acts, according to another court document. Almost one and a half years after completing his parole in the US, Arita returned to his criminal past in Guatemala, and is now accused of laundering millions. Arita had to submit his house, car, and workplace to searches if there was ""reasonable suspicion"" that he had violated the terms of his parole. If deported, he could not return to the United States without the authorization of the Attorney General's Office, as is the case with all foreigners who are convicted of drug trafficking. The court ordered Arita to pay the minimum fine of $100, and authorities would exempt him from paying additional fines given his inability to pay (in the end he only paid $25 in additional fees). But almost one and a half years after completing his parole in the US, Arita returned to his criminal past in Guatemala, and is now accused of laundering millions. In 2015, the Public Ministry linked him to money laundering, an activity that allowed him to handle much larger quantities of cash that the $25 he paid to the New York District Court. At least, that is what the Guatemalan prosecutor's office for money laundering believes. The office has linked Arita to the transit of $2.2 million into the hands of Guatemalan national Flavio Dimas Rojas in 2014. He has also been linked to a $360,000 drug shipment, transported by Jose Guillermo Maderos and Carlos Fermin Perez last February. The Charges Against Arita in Guatemala Guatemalan authorities link Arita to the Valle Valle criminal organization in Honduras, which the United States accused of drug trafficking in August 2014. In October, Honduran police captured Jose Reynerio, Miguel Arnulfo and Luis Alonso Valle Valle. Their sister, Digna Azucena, was also arrested for drug trafficking in the United States. According to an unofficial source, the Valles worked with the Lorenzana family, a Guatemalan drug trafficking group, in Zacapa. However, it is unclear what the status of this working relationship was after the capture of three members of both organizations between 2011 and 2013. The Attorney General's Office has tied Arita to an illicit network that moves money from the department of Chiquimula to Huehuetenango and later on to Mexico. This is a noteworthy smuggling route because in 2012, the prosecutor's office for money laundering revealed that cash is moved north to south -- from Mexico to Guatemala -- and eventually on to Panama and Colombia. Arita's network essentially operated in reverse, according to authorities. Nevertheless, there is at least one other case in which this south-to-north money trafficking route has been observed -- however, it does not end in Mexico, but in the United States. This case also involved a Guatemalan national. Between 2003 and 2007, a prosecutor in Florida documented how a network co-led by Otto Roberto Herrera Garcia collected cash in Mexico (for the Sinaloa Cartel) and sent it via currency exchange offices to a bank in Florida and a Bank of America in Oklahoma City. The goal: buy planes in the United States, send them to Colombia and Venezuela, and use them to ship cocaine to Guatemala and Mexico. Similarly to Arica, Guatemala capo Otto Herrera Garcia was also involved in a large money-smuggling network There are still suspicions that the $14 million found in April 2003 -- in a house that Herrera was renting in Guatemala City -- was supposed to be sent to Mexico, not to South America, as authorities believed at the time. There is no public information on where the cash Arita managed was ultimately supposed to end up, but there are similarities between his case and Herrera's. The Town of Chanmagua Under the Spotlight Police officials captured Arita in the town of Chanmagua, in the department of Chiquimula, close to the border with Honduras. It is not a place that is frequently mentioned in the press. It appeared in a few media reports in November 2012, when police seized a contraband cigarette shipment in the area. That same year, an ex-police officer and private investigator revealed that the town was a sales point for contraband firearms, especially assault rifles that arrived from Mexico via Belize. The red point shows where Arita was arrested in Guatemala In addition, on January 24, 2012, Guatemalan newspaper Siglo XXI described Chanmagua as a ""place for weapons and drug trafficking."" The newspaper also reported a multiple homicide case had taken place there, citing witnesses who said that six heavily-armed assassins burned a vehicle with Honduran license plates in Chanmagua, and later moved the dead bodies to Honduras. The testimonies state that police who arrived at the scene found only the scorched vehicle. Later, the Ministry of the Interior indicated that it found no evidence an assasination had taken place there. The murders reportedly occurred on the road headed towards Chanmagua, which eventually takes you to San Fernando Ocotepeque, a border crossing in Honduras. If Arita is an associate of the Valle Valles -- in addition to allegedly being involved in money laundering and drug trafficking -- it is unsurpising that authorities captured him in Chanmagua, according to the Attorney General's Office. An unofficial source affirmed that, despite recent arrests, the Valle Valles are still actively trafficking cocaine with their Guatemalan partners. Now, whether Arita will receive the same benevolence in Guatemala as he did in New York depends on whether or not the authorities are able to prove the charges against him. *This article was originally published in Plaza Publica and was translated, edited, and reprinted with permission.

"InSight: Mexicos Wall Street Decries Violence, But Ignores Own Responsibility. When crime hits the pocketbooks of the wealthy, it usually sparks the first real measures against it. But in Mexico, that response is taking a long time to crystallize. What's more, those calls for action overlook the wealthy class' own role in creating the situation in which organized crime emerges. For the third year in a row, a major financial institution, this time the BBVA , Mexico's largest financial institution, said that one percent of the GDP is lost due to crime and violence. BBVA joins a chorus of powerful voices singing the same song to government officials: It's time to do something about the large organized criminal syndicates. But even after the increase in the size of the federal police, multiple purges of security officials and the disbursement of over 30,000 troops to various parts of the country, Mexico is struggling. Over 15,000 were killed in events related to organized crime last year, bringing the total number of deaths to over 34,000 since Felipe Calderon took office in December 2006. Ironically, part of the reason the violence continues may be economic. Criminal activities are not bad for everyone. Indeed, many areas experience short-term and even long-term benefits from criminal activities. And those who do experience these increases in economic gains often control the levers of power - politicians, large landowners, importers whose buying power rises - giving them little incentive to really stop the criminal activities. Take Colombia, a place that has been enmeshed in a civil, sectarian and illegal drug-fueled conflict for nearly half a century. According to the World Bank , the Colombian economy has had a steady growth of four percent a year from 1960 to 2009, comparable to the other top-performing country in the region, Chile. Obviously, this cannot be explained by simply looking at the drug economy in Colombia, although some of the growth undoubtedly relates to that economy. How much is subject to an endless debate, but Rensselaer Lee, co-author of The Andean Cocaine Industry , once put that number at eight percent. Still the drugs are only part of the equation. In Colombia, other criminal activities may have paved the way for the creation of the ""modern state,"" thus facilitating long-term growth. Specifically, I am referring to the sectarian paramilitary groups who unleashed terror in the coffee regions of Colombia in the 1940s, 1950s and into the 1960s, displacing mostly smaller coffee growers and setting the stage for more industrial coffee farms to be developed that could compete on a world coffee market. This violence was partially sanctioned by the State, but because it fostered growth, it faced less public scrutiny. Its long-term consequences, however, were no less than tragic and may have cost the country more than what it gained in GDP. One of those displaced coffee farmers was named Antonio Marin. After joining a small political-military outfit that would become the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ), he took on the name Manuel Marualanda, or alias 'Tirofijo.' Marin died in 2008 of natural causes after creating the largest rebel army in the hemisphere. It remains to be seen if Mexico has created its own Marin, but the government's attempts to ""modernize"" its own economy, by entering the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States in 1994, may have spawned a few candidates. The resulting flood of U.S. agriculture products have left a generation of rural Mexicans ""displaced"" from the countryside, searching for work, and have sowed the seeds for the emergence of groups that are beginning to use FARC-like rhetoric. It's not a coincidence that the most ideological of the large drug cartels, the Familia Michoacana , is centered in one of the areas hardest hit by these shifts in the local economy. And while the one percent lost in GDP refers to increased security costs, lost investment, lost jobs and displacement, it does not take into account the large informal sector that is picking up the slack, part of which includes the criminal syndicates who employ the first post-NAFTA generation in places like Michoacan. That Mexico's financial sector is worried about its own pocketbooks is a good sign. The outcry is sure to result in the same political push for answers about why violence is rising and what can be done about it. But those answers should take into account the vast changes in the economy, some of which this same economic elite pushed for, as organized crime is sweeping the country. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"US Treasury Targeting More than Panama-based Operation?The United States Treasury Department's announcement that it was placing a Panama-based money laundering operation on its list of Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers (SDNTs) appears to be another step in unraveling a Middle East - Mexico connection that has both political and legal implications. In a statement, the Treasury Department said Jorge Fadlallah Cheaitelly and Mohamad El Khansa run 28 shell companies in Panama, Colombia and Hong Kong. One of these companies, Junior International S.A., is affiliated with an accused Lebanese drug trafficker, Ayman Joumaa, who made Treasury's SDNT list in January 2011. The Treasury also says the ""Cheaitelly/Khansa"" network works with operatives in Cali, Barranquilla and Maicao. ""By designating these individuals and companies we are exposing a significant international money laundering network, forcing them out of the international financial system, and undermining their ability to launder drug money through a global support network for the Mexican and Colombian drug cartels,"" the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Director Adam J. Szubin is quoted as saying in the government press release. The designation freezes the assets of all companies allegedly operating in this money laundering operation and means penalties for any business or individual who continues to do business with these companies. The press release did not mention Mexico's Zetas criminal gang by name, but this annoucement comes just two weeks after the US Department of Justice unsealed an indictment that accused Joumaa of moving drugs and helping to launder money for the Mexican group. According to the indictment, Joumaa, aka ""Junior,"" and his partners sold as much as 85 tons of cocaine to the Zetas between 2005-2007, which was later trafficked into the US, and laundered some $850 million in their profits for the group, some of it through the Lebanese Canadian Bank. The bank has denied any wrongdoing. [Download US indictment pdf ] The details of the conspiracy reveal a vast network that stretches from Colombia to various countries in Central America and Mexico; to Lebanon, Spain and the Democratic Congo; and back to the United States. Specifically, the indictment says that Joumaa and associates moved the cocaine from Colombia to Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico into the Zetas' hands. Some of the proceeds came back to Mexico in bulk cash, which Joumaa laundered in bundles of $2 mn to $4mn through Mexican, European and West African based operations. He then paid traffickers in Venezuela and Colombia in local currency, taking an estimated 8 to 14 percent commission along the way. Joumaa has also been connected to Middle Eastern political/military movement Hezbollah, according to a ProPublica report. Although the US says it is a business rather than a political relationship, it adds to the growing list of potential Hezbollah connections to the Latin American underworld. The US also recently accused the Iranian government of trying to use the Zetas to assassinate a Saudi official based in Washington DC, an accusation InSight Crime found sketchy. The attempt never happened as the ""Zetas"" operative was really working undercover for the US government. See InSight Crime's In either case, the US government appears ready to use these cases on two fronts: first, as a way to focus the spotlight on Hezbollah's and the Iranian government's potential effort to weave their way into the America's underworld and penalize them in the international theatre of public opinion; second, as a way to shift the battle against Mexico's drug trafficking organizations, in particular the Zetas, to a new legal playing field. That second legal playing field could result in the designation of the Zetas as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. This would permit the US Department of Justice to expand the ways in which it could prosecute members of the organization and their support network, including banks, weapons purveyors and other logistical enterprises. The designation of other Mexican groups could follow. It's not clear the Mexican government would appreciate such a politically and legally-charged move on the part of the State Department. The Mexican government has resisted efforts to qualify the Mexican criminal organizations as ""insurgents"" or ""terrorists,"" and it is wary of some US legislators' (and Pentagon hawks') attempts to further militarize the discourse around counter-narcotics strategy in Mexico as this tends to bolster a one-sided approach within Mexico.

"Unified Police Command Stalls Under Pena Nieto. President Enrique Pena Nieto appears to be dialing back the Mexican government's years-long attempt to forge the creation of unified police commands in all 32 states, a model seen by some as the best way to improve the ability of the security forces to take on organized crime. Interior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said at a regional security conference with governors this week that the new administration wants the creation of unified forces to ""be based on collaboration, that everyone is in agreement."" The unified commands, which place most municipal police under the direction of state officials, was a uncompleted pillar of the security reforms attempted by President Felipe Calderon, who left office five months ago. While adopted in a few states, and in parts of others, the model has faced stubborn resistance from many of Mexico's 2,400 mayors, who fear losing control of their police as well as the security budget underwritten by the federal government. ""Mexico's reality is very complex,"" said Alejandro Espriu, an analyst at Fundacion Incyde, a Mexico City think tank focused on police reform and other public security issues. ""A single model can't really work in every case. There isn't any necessity to force people to do this."" Osorio made it clear this week that the Pena Nieto administration wants to leave it up to the mayors and governors to work out. ""We don't want to force things, which was the earlier failure,"" Osorio said. ""They wanted to impose upon the municipalities, also upon the states."" Among the handful of Mexico's 32 states that already have adopted some form of unified command is Nuevo Leon, which borders Texas and girds Mexico's export-led economic growth. The state's population of four million people is heavily concentrated in metropolitan Monterrey, Mexico's third largest city and its industrial powerhouse. Gangland violence exploded in Monterrey three years ago thanks to the split between the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas, quickly overwhelming the capacity of local and state police to deal with it. [ See InSight Crime's three-part special about the Zetas and the battle for Monterrey]. ""When the problem got bad between the criminal groups and we started to combat it, we discovered that the police were not up to the task and on the contrary were cooperating with the criminals,"" Nuevo Leon Governor Rodrigo Medina said in a meeting with Insight Crime and other foreign media this week. In response, Medina's government fired 4,200 police officers statewide, replacing them with a new civil force staffed with officers contracted after a rigorous vetting system. Among the requirements for the new officers is that they've never served on a police force before. Only seven percent of applicants survived a vetting process polygraph exams and background check. ""It's a very intense process,"" Medina said. So far 3,200 new officers have been hired, Medina said, with another 2,000 new recruits being hired each year, about 80 new officers a week. But Medina said the effort has paid off, with some types of crime dropping sharply. Car thefts, which became a plague in recent years in Metropolitan Monterrey, have been reduced by 70 percent, according to state statistics. Statistics also show that gangland style killings declined by 30 percent between 2011 and last year. They dropped an additional 50 percent between the first quarter of 2012 to the first three months of 2013. The Pena Nieto administration's desire to forge consensus in creating the unified commands reflects the reality of a politically diverse Mexico, in which the presidency holds fewer levers of power. Without constitutional changes to provide federal funding for unified forces -- difficult to pass in a Congress dominated by Pena Nieto's opponents -- these forces have had to be jerry-rigged in the states where they've been adopted. But Osorio's comments this week almost certainly imply that the creation of the unified command will move forward even more slowly than before. Nuevo Leon is among Mexico's richest states. Medina and the state's mayors adopted the Civil Force under severe pressure from the gangland violence as well as Monterrey's powerful business elite. Although he belongs to Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Medina became one of Mexico's governors most closely allied with Calderon's military-led anti-crime offensive. ""Security costs a lot but insecurity costs even more,"" said Medina, who estimated that creation of the unified police took up more than half his time in the past two years. ""To achieve this requires political will."" ""Unfortunately we have seen statements from other places that 'this is not my problem, this is the problem of the federal government.' We never said that. We said this is our problem, and we are going to deal with it as if the federal government doesn't exist."" But such consensus remains hard to come by in Mexico, even as national political leaders continue to support the Pact for Mexico that has enabled Congressional approval of economic and labor reforms. Mayors and governors have very distinct priorities than Mexico City and police reform costs a lot of money. Gang bosses, who often wield de facto control in many regions and states, can't be expected to support improving the police. As prominent journalist Carlos Puig wrote on his blog this week , Calderon's attempt to force through the creation of unified police forces might have sealed the project's slow progress to date. But ""neither is it clear that appealing to good will have a real impact in the quality of our police or in what results these forces of order deliver to citizens."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Arrests Point to Zetas in Mexico Musicians Massacre. Mexico has announced the arrest of an alleged Zetas member linked to the massacre of 17 musicians, in a case that highlights the struggle for social, as well as physical, territory between cartels in Mexico. The Attorney General's Office Special Kidnapping Unit captured Edgar Alberto de la Garza Trevino on September 27 for his involvement in the murder of 17 members of Kombo Kolombia -- a Mexican group that played Colombian ""vallenato"" music -- in Nuevo Laredo on January 25, reported Milenio. Authorities believe the murders took place because the group had begun playing in places that had been controlled by the Zetas, but which later fell under the rule of their fierce rivals, the Gulf Cartel, reported Proceso. Among the murdered were thirteen musicians, three assistants and a sound engineer, reported El Universal. According to Nuevo Leon security spokesman Jorge Domene, de la Garza Trevino initially acted as lookout and later aided in the kidnapping, but was not involved in the murder. Police are currently searching for six more people wanted in connection with the crime. The fight between the Mexican drug cartels for control of sections of territory, known as ""plazas,"" is the main driver of the country's drug war violence. This struggle has been taken to a new level by the Zetas, whose military approach and focus on seizing and controlling territory over establishing criminal infrastructure has helped them expand rapidly in both Mexico and some Central American countries. Groups battle for control of plazas because it gives them control over the criminal activities in the area, in turn providing profits either through taxes or through directly running these activities. However, as illustrated in the case of Kombo Kolombia, control of an area often goes beyond the physical and can also incorporate social space, which is important to criminal groups as a means to project power in a given area. In many of the most fiercely contested cartel wars, the control of social space has become a key component of territorial control, even if it does not directly involve economic gain."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Glyphosate Alone Wont Fix Colombias Complex Coca Woes. Colombia's Constitutional Court is debating lifting a judicial ban on the spraying of glyphosate during the aerial fumigation of illicit coca crops, a decision that is unlikely to fix the nation's coca problems. At the beginning of March, the court announced that it would accept President Ivan Duque's request for a hearing to debate the lifting of a 2015 ban on the aerial spraying of coca crops with the herbicide glyphosate. ""We have been left without the necessary tools to confront the greatest threat to constitutional order in many places across the country,"" Duque said in favor of modifying the ban in remarks he gave during the March 7 hearing. He added that such a decision would ""strengthen public order and the defense of fundamental rights."" Colombia Attorney General Humberto Martinez and Defense Minister Guillermo Botero both supported Duque's request that the Constitutional Court permit a return to the use of glyphosate during aerial fumigation, arguing that the current methods being used have been ineffective. On the other hand, former President Juan Manuel Santos criticized the ""high human cost"" of forced eradication and the lack of attention that modifying the ban on glyphosate has on one of the primary threats to eradicating coca crops: farmers replanting them. Rates of ""replanting were and continue to be high -- more than 60 percent in some cases -- not only because there's no territorial control, but because small farmers simply do not have any alternatives to replanting [coca crops],"" the former president said. In 2015, the Santos administration halted the use of the Monsanto-produced glyphosate to fumigate coca crops. Both Colombian and US authorities have called to revive its use in the years since despite the World Health Organization's (WHO) findings that the herbicide has ""links to cancer."" Other critics of the use of glyphosate and forcibly eradicating coca crops echoed Santos' statements, arguing that the human costs and vulnerability of eradication teams should make officials ""seriously rethink"" how best to address the country's coca cultivation and related cocaine production. (Click to enlarge) The amount of land being used to cultivate coca -- the raw ingredient in cocaine -- and total cocaine production in Colombia have been on the rise since 2013. A record 171,000 hectares were used for coca cultivation in 2017, helping the world's top cocaine producer manufacture 1,379 metric tons of the drug, a 31 percent increase from the year before, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The Duque administration in Colombia is convinced that, despite its past failures and high humanitarian costs, a return to aerial fumigation using glyphosate is the only way to help curtail record coca cultivation and cocaine production in the Andean nation, something his predecessor was unable to reign in. ""This isn't a decision about a herbicide, the true discussion is about the risks and threats that our country is confronting,"" Duque said. Antioquia Governor Luis Perez Gutierrez supported the president, explaining that ""illicit crops in Colombia smell of blood and crime."" The governor added that the state is ""losing the war to eradicate illicit crops."" Coca cultivation in Antioquia was relatively low in comparison to the country's main cocaine-producing departments of Narino and Putumayo around 2006 and 2007, when the government was spraying coca crops at its highest rates. Since then, however, coca cultivation in the northwest department has jumped from 6,096 hectares in December 2008 to 9,343 hectares in December 2016, increasing another 55 percent to 13,681 hectares in December 2017, according to the UNODC. In particular, the Bajo Cauca region of Antioquia has been the sight of brutal battles waged over drug trafficking and other illicit activities between the Urabenos and a network of dissident former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) fighters from the 36th Front that is aligned with a splinter group known as the Caparrapos. However, while aerial fumigation can produce short-term reductions in coca cultivation, coca crops have recovered in the long-term as farmers replant and grow more crops in response, while also deploying other strategies to adjust their growing operations in the wake of increased forced eradication. The citizens of southwest Narino and Putumayo departments -- which, according to the UNODC, were Colombia's biggest cocaine producing departments and accounted for nearly 50 percent of the total land used for coca cultivation in 2017 -- know this better than anyone. ""Human eradication has cost us the most valuable thing: human lives. Police and small farmers have lost their lives during eradication efforts,"" said Narino Governor Camilo Romero Galeano, arguing that one effective solution over the use of glyphosate is the substitution of coca crops. Indeed, nine civilians were killed and 18 others wounded in an October 2017 clash over the government's forced eradication of coca crops in the Pacific port city of Tumaco. Other civilians and government officials have also been killed while forcibly eradicating coca crops in this criminally strategic department. Putumayo Governor Sorrel Aroca added that small farmers are waiting for the government to ""fulfill what was promised as part of the crop substitution program"" included in the FARC peace deal. Known as the National Comprehensive Program for the Substitution of Illicit Crops (Programa Nacional Integral de Sustitucion de Cultivos de Uso Ilicito - PNIS), criminal violence, tensions between coca farmers and UN observers, as well as a lack of state presence and the government's slow implementation of key aspects of the program have all threatened its implementation. What's more, aggressive coca eradication goals and government neglect regarding payment to families partaking in the PNIS program have also jeopardized its success. Some reports suggest that voluntary crop substitution is more effective than forced eradication when it comes to farmers replanting coca crops. A recent United Nations study, for example, found that 35 percent of small farmers replant coca crops after security forces forcibly eradicate them. But when communities voluntarily substitute coca crops, just 0.6 percent of farmers replant them, El Tiempo reported. Still, what's been lost in the black and white debate about a return to the use of glyphosate is the complexity of combatting coca cultivation and cocaine production in Colombia, and the need for a multifaceted strategy with a long-term focus. If the government can't guarantee the safety of small farmers from powerful criminal groups, and if small farmers don't have viable alternatives to coca crops that allow them to earn a living wage, then the country's anti-drug struggles seem poised to continue. *This article was written with assistance from InSight Crime's Colombian Organized Crime Observatory.

"Freeing Inmates Not Enough to Fix Venezuela Prisons. Venezuela's new prison minister has promised to release nearly half of the country's inmates in an effort to ease overcrowding, but this fails to take into account the many other structural flaws in Venezuela's broken penal system. According to Venezuela's new prison minister, Iris Varela, 40 percent of the country's 50,000 inmates could soon be free. In an interview with El Nacional , Varela declared that the major contributor to the country's prison crisis is overcrowding, saying ""For me, the achievement will not be to open prisons, but to close them."" The minister, who was appointed by President Hugo Chavez on June 25 , said that officials will begin work this week to expedite the release of up to 20,000 inmates who meet certain legal requirements and do not pose a threat to society. She was careful to assure Venezuelans that authorities will not let ""wolves loose on the streets."" Some of Varela's other remarks are sure to raise the ire of Chavez's critics, who have repeatedly expressed concerns about the state of judicial independence in the country. According to BBC Mundo , the newly-appointed minister, a loyal Chavista, offered a firm warning to judges opposed to her work: ""If a judge gives me problems, I'll tell the president of the TSJ [Supreme Justice Tribunal] to remove him from his position."" The announcement comes just one month after more than 25 people were killed in deadly clashes at the El Rodeo prison complex in Guatire, a city just twenty five miles east of Caracas. The deaths sparked a 27-day standoff between prisoners and security forces, which finally came to an end on July 13. Last year, 476 inmates were killed and another 967 were injured, according to the Venezuelan Prison Observatory , an non-governmental organization which monitors prison conditions. From 1999 to 2010, a total of 4,506 inmates reportedly died and 12,518 were injured, a phenomenon which the group has linked to a lack of institutional capacity to deal with overflowing prisons in the country. The organization's director, Humberto Prado, told AFP in July that the entire El Rodeo prison complex housed more than 3,600 inmates although it only has capacity for 750, forcing hundreds of inmates sleep on the floor, stairs and hallways. While Varela's concerns are valid, it should be noted that her strategy would not represent an end to prison overcrowding. Citing official figures, AFP notes that Venezuelan prisons are meant to hold only 14,000 inmates, which means that even if all of the proposed 20,000 are released, the prison system would still hold more than twice its intended population. Overcrowding is not the only problem of Venezuela's prisons. Many, if not most, are controlled by street gangs, and serve as ""revolving doors"" for criminal activity. Inmates have nearly unlimited access to visitors, who frequently smuggle in drugs and weapons. In these institutions, the real powerbrokers are often the gang leaders, or ""pranes,"" rather than their guards. The New York Times' Simon Romero profiled one such prison on Margarita Island in June, taking special note of the respect afforded by inmates to the prison's ""pran,"" Teofilo Rodriguez, alias ""El Conejo."" As InSight Crime has previously noted , many of these gang bosses maintain their criminal networks outside ot the prison walls, continuing to organize extortion rings, kidnapping networks and minor drug trafficking operations while in jail. On July 12, President Chavez announced that he would invest 413 million bolivars ($96 million) in reforming the prison system , but it is still unclear how that money will be spent. Venezuela has made similar attempts in the past, including a one billion dollar plan to ""humanize"" the prison system in 2006. As the Venezuela Prison Observatory's annual report for that year indicates, however, prison deaths have since increased by nearly 15 percent. Ultimately, the criminal penetration of Venezuela's prisons cannot be solved by simply by releasing more of them. It will require significant investment into the criminal justice sector, on top of major reform of law enforcement. The government may even have to construct new prisons, despite Varela's reluctance.

"MS13 Expanding After Truce Collapse in El Salvador?In the aftermath of the collapse of El Salvador's gang truce, authorities have said the MS13 gang is deepening its hold on illegal migration routes in Mexico, a possible sign of the increasing transnational capabilities indicated by both Salvadoran and US officials. Cells of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) are attempting to establish control over routes used by migrants in various towns in Chiapas state, on the border with Guatemala. They are targeting undocumented migrants for extortion and kidnapping, among other crimes, reported Proceso. According to the special prosecutor for Chiapas' migrant unit, Alejandro Vila, there have already been a number of confrontations between these cells and their rivals of Barrio 18, also present in the zone. Vila said the renewed presence of the MS13 was a result of the reactivation of freight train ""The Beast,"" commonly used by northward bound Central American migrants. The train's operations had been suspended due to hurricane damage. The report comes shortly after El Salvador's outgoing president declared the truce between the MS13 and Barrio 18 had ""failed."" Just before the announcement, the tiny Central American nation saw a return to record murder rates, with 30 homicides registered in a single day. El Salvador's gang truce, initially credited with nearly halving the country's homicide rate, was abandoned by the government that helped negotiate it. Homicides have been steadily rising since mid-2013, and truce critics -- particularly Security Minister Ricardo Perdomo -- have claimed the gangs simply used the initiative to grow stronger and increase their involvement in transnational drug trafficking. The United States had already given a similar prognosis for the MS13 in late 2012, when it designated the group a transnational criminal organization , citing activities including drug trafficking, human smuggling and sex trafficking. The MS13's structure has been previously described as a loose, decentralized network with highly localized operations. However, there have been signs of a growingly sophisticated and integrated command structure, including interactions between US-based leaders and Salvadoran members. If the MS13 is increasing its presence in Mexico's southern border region, this could be another indication of increasing transnational reach. While the gang has long been involved in kidnapping and extorting migrants , the current report suggests significant control over a large area, which would demand some coordination. However there it is perhaps easy to overestimate the cohesion of MS13, which is not a centrally directed and coordinated organization, but rather a franchise of affiliated cliques, which can sometimes work together."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Colombias Invisible Drug Traffickers May Include Narco-Ghost. A profile of a Colombian drug trafficker who, after a long criminal career, disappeared off the radar highlights how key figures in the underworld continue to successfully operate undetected. According to an investigation by news site Pacifista , Guillermo Camacho Acevedo, alias ""Memo Fantasma,"" was a major drug trafficker who staged his disappearence in order to protect the interests of paramilitary leaders -- and who may still be active today. Pacifista reports that Camacho began his drug-running career as an envoy for a faction of Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel, handling wholesale distribution of cocaine shipments in New York. When Escobar accused Camacho's bosses of treachery and had them murdered in 1992, Camacho was left alone with his latest cocaine shipment. He sold the load on and used the profits to set himself up as an independent operator. Camacho returned to Colombia around 1996, where he forged an alliance with the right-wing paramilitary coaliation, known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). He worked with the AUC in driving guerrilla rebels out of key drug production zones, according to Pacifista's sources. Camacho eventually became a key figure in a powerful paramilitary faction, the Central Bolivar Bloc, and helped make them one of the paramilitary units most heavily involved in the drug trade. Pacifista records how Camacho then participated in the first demobilization talks between the AUC leadership and the Colombian government. However, by 2004, all traces of Camacho's participation began to disappear. According to Pacifista, Camacho abandoned the peace process in order to secretly protect the assets and drug trafficking networks of the AUC leaders, who had agreed to hand over all their ill-gotten gains and dismantle their organizations as part of the peace agreement. Since then, Camacho is believed to have become the chief of finances for the Rastrojos, one of the principal criminal groups that emerged after the AUC demobilization. It is a role he continues to perform today, sources told Pacifista. The strange tale of ""Memo Fantasma"" is illustrative of how the botched demobilization of the AUC gave rise to a new generation of narco-paramilitary groups -- and may have serious implications for the current dynamic in Colombia's underworld. The failure to break up the drug trafficking networks established by the AUC created the new generation of criminal groups that included the Rastrojos. From the start, these groups were controlled by former paramilitaries who did not demobilize or who rearmed. The Rastrojos emerged as the most powerful of these new networks, largely by filling the vacuum left by the Central Bolivar Bloc. Although the Rastrojos has since suffered a dramatic demise after its known leaders surrendered or were arrested , local factions still operate. Their continued existence may be related to ongoing backing from financers and drug traffickers such as Camacho. Camacho may not be the only ""narco-ghost"" operating from the shadows. Key sectors of Colombia's underworld are believed to be run by a network of so-called ""invisibles :"" long-time drug traffickers who have managed to avoid the attention of authorities."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"The Murder of Guatemalas Prison King Byron Lima: A Self-Coup detat? (Part III). Shortly after Otto Perez Molina was elected president of Guatemala, Byron Lima Oliva, the once-decorated former army captain, jailed for the murder of a bishop, sat down to write an email to the newly named minister of Interior, Mauricio Lopez Bonilla. ""Don Damian,"" he began, using Lopez Bonilla's nom de guerre. The three of them -- Perez Molina, Lopez Bonilla and Lima -- were all in the army together. ""Here is the list of ideal people for the most important posts in the Penitentiary System's Board of Directors, who will be the base for an optimal administration of your future activity as interior minister."" The email, which was obtained by Contrapoder , recommended 65 candidates, including the director, the subdirector and numerous mid-level functionaries, some of whom had graduated from the military academy with Lima and at least one of which was a relative by marriage. Lima had been jailed 11 years prior for the murder of Bishop Juan Gerardi, but he had maintained his contacts and used them to gain control of everything from contraband liquor sales to the use of telephones inside the prisons. Lopez Bonilla eventually named about half of the suggested candidates, Contrapoder said. The magazine said these functionaries referred to Lima as ""Capi"" or ""Jefe,"" and consulted with him before making decisions. They also schemed with him to make money: in Lima's regime, it would cost upwards of $7,000 to transfer from one prison to another. And they opened the door to other corruption, such as collecting millions in bribes from drug traffickers in return for keeping them ""safe"" in jail while they awaited extradition to the United States. In one case, a suspected trafficker who refused to pay $800,000 was taken to a room where a bag of human feces was placed over his head, government investigators told InSight Crime. The inmate later paid, then allegedly put a price on Lima's head for the same amount: $800,000. A Counter-corruption Revolution The corruption in the penitentiary system was the tip of the iceberg for the Perez Molina administration. Beginning in April 2015, investigators from the Attorney General's Office and its United Nations-appendage, the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG), began making public a series of corruption cases that have since landed Perez Molina, his vice president, Roxana Baldetti, Lopez Bonilla and many other officials and ex-officials in jail while they face trial. The Attorney General's Office and the CICIG have followed these up with cases against local and national politicians, international and Guatemalan companies, hotel and bank owners, among others. There are so many cases that most Guatemalans are having a hard time sorting through them, a danger in a country where disinformation and confusion are often used to overturn even the most noble causes. The cases are part of a slow-moving revolution that is upending the status quo in a country where economic elites, military officials, politicians, judges and virtually anyone else with money and connections are assured that justice does not apply to them. On the one side are the Attorney General's Office and the CICIG. Most recently, they have been joined by the Interior Ministry and Guatemala's version of the Internal Revenue Service, known as the Superintendencia de Administracion Tributaria (SAT). Their patron is the US Embassy, whose Ambassador Todd Robinson , along with the CICIG's Colombian Commissioner Ivan Velasquez , have become their ad hoc spokespeople. On the other side is everyone under indictment and their allies. This includes, of course, former administration officials Perez Molina, Baldetti and Lopez Bonilla, as well as parts of the traditional economic elite, who also suddenly find themselves on the defensive. It also includes former and current military officials, some of whom have been connected to nefarious criminal networks that sprung from the army's intelligence services. These groups also have allies in the presidency, mostly former military since President Jimmy Morales' own party was formed by a group of former army officials. Lima's father, Colonel Byron Lima Estrada, was connected to one of the more nefarious networks, which are often referred to as Illegal Clandestine Security Apparatuses (Cuerpos Ilegales y Aparatos Clandestinos de Seguridad - CIACS). He participated in at least two coups, a successful one in 1983, which unseated President (and General) Efrain Rios Montt; and another failed one in 1988, against the first civilian president in 25 years, who the colonel referred to regularly as a ""communist."" The CIACS and Byron Lima The younger Lima's relationships with these networks is a bit more fluid. He has been tied mostly to the network run by former President Perez Molina. Known as the Sindicato, or the Union, this group came from a slightly more forward-thinking part of the military that eventually advocated for peace talks with the guerrillas and the downsizing of the military. Perez Molina continued to reinvent himself and spread his alliances into the circles of the country's foremost economic elites. Lima has also been tied to the older guard network, known as the Cofradia, or the Brotherhood. The Cofradia's longtime leader is retired Gen. Francisco Ortega Menaldo. In addition to working in various parts of military intelligence and as the head of the Presidential Security Service (Estado Mayor Presidencial - EMP), Ortega Menaldo also worked in the Finance Ministry and had an incredible knack for putting his allies in the Customs Office and the ports , long an area where military officials had been collecting bribes for the movement of contraband and illicit drugs. Lima's connections to the Cofradia are much less likely. His father clashed with Ortega Menaldo in the failed military coup attempt of 1988. (See US Government memo on this coup here in pdf ) And in 1993, Lima's mentor, Perez Molina, clashed with Ortega Menaldo when then-President Jorge Serrano tried to throw Congress out in what was described then as an ""autogolpe,"" or a ""self-inflicted coup d'etat."" Ortega Menaldo was Serrano's top advisor. Perez Molina was head of army intelligence, the D2, and opposed the self-coup, which eventually failed. For some, it showed a triumph of the more progressive wing of the military. For others, it was part of a long-standing battle over the most important revenue stream for current and ex-military alike: customs and border protection. Cracks in the System By the time he became president in 2012, Perez Molina's alliances had evolved. He appeared to be at peace with some of the Cofradia. He even appointed some suspected members to his security team and his administration named others to work in the customs agency. He also appeared willing to share in the spoils that came with power, especially as they related to customs and border protection, which was managed in part by his ambitious vice president, Baldetti, as well as former and current military officials. But there were cracks in the system, beginning with the prisons and Byron Lima. Lima seemed to be overstepping his bounds, soliciting 100 official ""leaves"" from prison in February 2013 alone. In that same month, he was stopped by police, returning from one of these leaves to the ""dentist."" Interior Minister Lopez Bonilla held a press conference, denounced Lima, and removed the head of the prison system who Lima had named in that infamous 2011 email addressed to ""Don Damian."" (See parts of the press conference video below) Lima did not take kindly to the seeming hypocrisy. He called Lopez Bonilla a ""traitor,"" and a ""communist."" He told InSight Crime later that it was Lopez Bonilla, and not him, who was blackmailing drug traffickers and putting bags of feces over their heads if they did not pay him the ""protection"" fee. And he threatened to reveal the multiple schemes Lopez Bonilla had for giving companies tied to him contracts from the Interior Ministry. ""Investigate who owns the telephones in the jail system,"" he told InSight Crime in April. ""Who does that belong to? Investigate who runs the food services in the jail system. Who is the owner? Lopez Bonilla's son. Investigate the cameras. Lopez Bonilla"" Lima's list continued: vehicles, computers and photocopy machines, all rented by the ministry from companies connected to or owned by Lopez Bonilla; none of the contracts with the option to buy, Lima said. InSight Crime inquired with the Interior Ministry, which said simply they were investigating numerous claims of corruption during the Lopez Bonilla period. An Assassination Plot Once these former officials were jailed for corruption, their needs changed radically. With the the US firmly behind the investigations and institutions leading them, the jailed former officials and their allies understood that they could not engineer a formal coup d'etat. They do not have the power or the cohesion to actually achieve it. And they are not necessarily against President Jimmy Morales. As noted, they have allies in the presidency, some of whom work in Guatemala's version of the Secret Service, the Secretary of Administrative and Security Matters of the President (Secretaria de Asuntos Administrativos y de Seguridad de la Presidencia - SAAS). Instead, they had to think of ways to rid themselves of their investigators. In other words, they needed their own self-coup d'etat, something to upend the system that is altering the status quo and jailing them and their allies -- from the military to the politicians to the bankers -- in the process. Ambassador Robinson and Commissioner Velasquez are virtually untouchable, so it was decided that the target would Attorney General Thelma Aldana. For her part, Aldana had come full circle. When she was named attorney general by Perez Molina in 2013, Aldana was thought to be in the presidency's pocket. She had been flagged by the CICIG twice while she was a high court judge, and she had a relationship with then Vice President Roxana Baldetti. However, Aldana had proven adept at seeing which way the wind was blowing, and to the surprise of many observers, became a willing partner with CICIG, the US government and the other Guatemalan government allies that were pushing for these corruption cases to move forward. The details of the plan to kill Aldana are sketchy, but both Guatemalan and US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the threats were credible. They said that the man who was asked to organize the assassination is a suspected drug trafficker who was also former military, and that he had the means to do it. But he asked for too much money. Those plotting turned elsewhere, officials said, perhaps to Mexican or Honduran nationals. In a June 19 column , elPeriodico owner Jose Ruben Zamora said that Byron Lima was ""the link"" between the assassin and the military network that wanted Aldana killed. This network, Zamora claimed, was firmly placed in the presidency. Zamora adds that he was also a target of the plot. When the US, CICIG and others got wind of the plot, they whisked Aldana out of the country for a few weeks. With the plot thwarted -- or least stalled -- Zamora says the conspiracy moved on to eliminating witnesses, namely, Lima. And on July 18, in a surprise assault inside the Pavon prison facility, Lima was assassinated. Twelve other people were killed in the process and 10 more were injured. Getting rid of Lima served a second purpose as well, especially for Lopez Bonilla, Perez Molina and others who maintained connections with Lima while he was in prison: it eliminated a seemingly willing witness to their transgressions while they were in office. Plan B: Dethrone the Interior Minister? Zamora's theory about the motives behind Lima's murder has holes in it. The mastermind of the supposed plot to kill Aldana is the brother of one of Lima's military academy classmates, and someone that Lima's brother, Luis Lima, described to InSight Crime as, ""with us."" Luis Lima also said Byron's alleged involvement in the plot is absurd because he was struggling to get released, so, ""Why would he want to kill Thelma Aldana?"" However, Lima's death could still be part of a plan to destabilize the government, execute a type of self-coup d'etat. After Aldana, the second logical target for those being prosecuted for corruption is Interior Minister Francisco Rivas. Rivas is a seasoned prosecutor who has spent his career in the Attorney General's Office, and he has become a critical part of the alliance to unseat the status quo. But he is surrounded by wolves at the Interior Ministry, as Zamora also pointed out in his column. Some of these officials are still loyal to Lopez Bonilla, and Rivas looked like a deer in headlights in his press conference after Lima's death. (See below) Rivas' fragile hold in the ministry is offset by the firm backing he has from the US government. But Lima's death, and the subsequent chaos it creates within the penitentiary system, may lead to his downfall and thus serve a similar purpose as removing Aldana would. Ministry officials are certainly worried. They have moved quickly to replace several top prison officials and launch an internal investigation into how such a sophisticated attack occurred inside prison walls. But they can do little to quell the conspiracy theories. As noted in this three-part series on Lima's July 18 murder, his list of enemies was as long as it was sordid. And the central question is as much who did it, as who wins with Lima's bloody inglorious end inside prison walls. See Part I - Who Killed Guatemala's Prison ""King"" Byron Lima?

"Homicides Rising in West Argentina Amid Evolution of Drug Gangs. Authorities in Argentina have said a 60 percent rise in murders in the city of Mendoza is linked to the drug trade, following a nationwide pattern of rising violence as transnational organized crime takes root and local criminal groups evolve. Between January 1 and June 18 this year, 88 murders were registered in Mendoza in west Argentina, compared to just 55 in the same months in 2013, reported La Nacion. Murders for 2014 are now on track to surpass the 141 murders seen in 2012, a high of recent years. Mendoza Police Chief Juan Carlos Caleri said the majority of the homicides occurred among acquaintances and took place during the first three months of the year when the drug gangs were ""at their peak,"" both factors that contribute to the idea drug disputes were partly responsible for the rise. Two cases that stood out this year were the the murder of Cristian Gelvez , the husband of a local drug gang leader, and that of Daiana Reynoso , a young woman who was discovered with several bullet holes in her body, signs of torture, and a plastic bag over her head. Her husband had been killed in a similar manner just a month before and investigators believe the killings could be linked to drug trafficking. As foreign organized crime has become more established in Argentina and drug transit through the country has risen, a significant domestic market for cocaine and its derivatives has developed, leading to the emergence of increasingly sophisticated and violent homegrown criminal organizations. The epicenter of this has been the northeastern city at the end of the infamous Ruta 34 ""cocaine highway,"" Rosario, where drug gang disputes have led to an unprecedented spike in murders. Mendoza, on the Chilean border, is removed from the principal land route used to traffic cocaine into Argentina from Bolivia. Nonetheless, there are indications a significant local market exists , and there have been signs of a somewhat sophisticated drug gang presence. A group known as "" Yaqui's Little Angels ,"" allegedly run by a woman nicknamed ""Yaqui"" who was arrested earlier this year , reportedly operated with a network of teenage assassins and at one point attacked journalists who had published details of the group's structure."	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Security Surge in Michoacan to Confront Familia-Knights Templar Battle. Mexico deployed approximately 4,000 troops to the western state of Michoacan, where rival criminal gangs are engaged in a heated battle over control of the region. Troops began arriving in the state capital Morelia on Wednesday, along with a military convoy so large that many vehicles had to be parked on the streets outside of the city military headquarters, reports Milenio. The military surge was accompanied by rumors that the rival criminal groups most active in Michoacan, the Familia Michoacana and their splinter group the Knights Templar, would carry out a series of armed actions this week. In Morelia, schools were dismissed and businesses closed early. In the state's other most important city, Lazaro Cardenas, a traffic blockade blocked the major roads leading into the port city. Some of the trucks and taxis in the blockade carried signs protesting the military surge, according to local newspaper Cambio de Michoacan. The deployment appears to be in response to a wave of violence seen in rural Michoacan since late 2011. In the most serious incident, 13 men were found dead outside the town of Zitacuaro on January 9. The Michoacan government has reportedly identified at least 10 municipalities in the state that are seriously threatened by criminal violence (see map below). These include Apatzingan, Uruapan, Patzcuaro, Tzintzuntzan, Santa Clara del Cobre, Erongaricuaro, Acuitzio del Canje, Villa Madero, Quiroga, and Zitcuaro. This is a strategically important area for drug traffickers thanks to the access to Mexico's Federal Highway 15, the primary route connecting the north with the south. The mountainous region also provides shelter for methaphetamine laboratories, particularly prevelant in Michoacan thanks to the imports of chemicals which pass through the Lazaro Cardenas port. The focal point of the surge may be Apatzingan, an important center of operations for Knights Templar, the offshoot group of the Familia Michoacana. The Knights Templar is headed by former Familia commander Servando Gomez Martinez, alias ""La Tuta ."" The leader of the rival Familia faction, Jose Jesus Mendez Vargas, alias ""El Chango,"" was arrested in June 2011. Michoacan is also the home state of President Felipe Calderon, which partly explains why the area has received so much attention from the security forces since 2006. This was the first state where Calderon sent the military to fight drug violence shortly after assuming office. According to a count by Cambio de Michoacan , there are currently some 10,000 police and military personnel deployed here. View Uruapan, Michoacan in a larger map "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Conviction Overturned in Zetas US Horse Racing Case. A US appeals court has overturned a conviction and ordered a retrial for US citizens accused of laundering drug profits for Mexico's Zetas through racehorses, in a case that illustrates the challenges in breaking down transnational money laundering networks. A three-judge panel at a Federal Appeals Court in New Orleans has overturned the money laundering conviction of horse trainer Eusevio Maldonado Huitron, stating that prosecutors failed to demonstrate his intentional involvement in illegal activities. While the judges did not dispute that the horse stables where Maldonado worked were used to launder money for Mexico's Zetas cartel, they argued that there was no evidence to indicate Maldonado had taken part in anything but training the horses bought with drug money. The ruling also called for a retrial in the case of Francisco Colorado Cessa, who prosecutors alleged had founded a company with a loan from a Zetas member and purchased horses on behalf of the cartel with illicit funds. The judges made the decision based on the instructions given to the jury by the trial judge, who told them they must consider the defendant guilty of money laundering if they believed there was a commingling of legal money from his business with illegal funds. However, the new ruling states, this is incorrect, and the jury should have been instructed that although they could come to that conclusion, they could also decide otherwise -- that the mixing of legal and illegal revenues was not a deliberate attempt to launder money. The convictions of the two other men involved in the trial, Fernando Garcia Solis and Jose Trevino Morales , the brother of Zetas leaders Z40 and Z42, were upheld. The story of how the Zetas infiltrated the world of US horse racing to launder their drug trade profits has become one of the most infamous cases exposing the US business interests of Mexican cartels. However, with this latest ruling, it is now also an example of just how difficult it is to prosecute money laundering cases. Even after prosecutors had firmly established that the business was used to disguise criminal profits, proving that all of the front men involved were aware of its illegal purpose has proved much more complicated. Tackling organized crime by going after its financial assets can be one of the most effective ways of targeting networks, as it hits crime bosses where it hurts them most -- in their pockets. However, unpicking criminal business interests from legal ones is a long, complicated process that, as in this case, can be derailed by uncertainties.	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
Surge in Tijuana Violence Recalls Past Bloodshed. Tijuana's murder rate has spiked dramatically in recent months, leaving officials searching for reasons and responses to an emerging security crisis in Mexico's northern border city. As reported by the San Diego Union-Tribune and other outlets , 2016 has been more violent than any recent year for the Baja California border city. Through the first nine months of the year, authorities had registered 636 murders. This puts it on a pace for 848 murders in the whole of the year, which, according to the Tribune's statistics, would narrowly break the 2010 record of 844, the most violent year in recent memory. Mexico's statistical agency, Inegi , shows higher numbers, with more than 1,119 murders in 2009 and 1,256 in 2010. (Retroactive increases in the murder rate are common from Inegi, which compiles a more exhaustive record.) In any event, there is little dispute that Tijuana has suffered a precipitous decline in its security situation relative to the past couple of years, and that it is on its way to its most blood-soaked year since the height of the administration of former President Felipe Calderon (2006-2012). Local leaders from various realms have attempted to spur a response, demonstrating a degree of foresight often lacking amid bouts of violence, but thus far they have yet to settle on a concrete strategy. Instead, per the Union-Tribune's reporting, they have focused on shortcomings in the current approach to security, including an inattention to drug addiction, a lack of collaboration among the three levels of government, and the inability to target gangs' financial structures. The rise in murders may be due to an ongoing shift in the city's criminal dynamics. In the 1990s, the Arellano Felix family built one of the hemisphere's most powerful drug trafficking organizations, the Tijuana Cartel, on the back of its control of the city. While it had a reputation for brutality, the group's control brought some measure of stability; Tijuana only averaged about 200 killings a year during the 1990s, according to Inegi. But the Arellano Felix family's decline since the mid-2000s has vaulted the city into a period of sporadic chaos. The spate of killings in 2009 and 2010 was largely the result of the Sinaloa Cartel working with a former Arellano Felix lieutenant, Teo Garcia, to take control of the city. A brief consolidation of power by the Jalisco Cartel, rather than a prolonged struggle by a Sinaloa Cartel in decline, could actually help curb the rising violence in Tijuana. The Sinaloa Cartel appears to be losing its grip on the territory, however, with Mexican officials speculating that the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation has moved into the city. Some analysts have reported that the Jalisco Cartel, which was formed in the aftermath of former Sinaloa kingpin Ignacio Coronel's death, is now working with rump elements of the Tijuana Cartel to push Sinaloa Cartel loyalists out of the city. Analysts have also pointed to the Jalisco Cartel's movement into Baja California Sur, the state comprising the southern half of the Baja California peninsula, which appears to be part of the broader expansion that also includes Tijuana. Tijuana has an annual murder rate of approximately 50 per 100,000 residents. While this is far from the worse manifestation of Mexican violence -in Juarez in 2010, for instance, the figure was almost six times that high- it also speaks to the potential for worsening if the causes of the uptick in homicides are not addressed. In Juarez, some combination of the naturally emerging stabilization of the local drug trade and the aggressive tactics of local police chief Julian Leyzaola brought about the dramatic improvement in the early part of this decade. Opinions vary, but the improvement probably had more to do with the former than the latter. This suggests that a brief consolidation of power by the Jalisco Cartel, rather than a prolonged struggle by a Sinaloa Cartel in decline, could actually help curb the rising violence in Tijuana. The various attributes of the area make it of perennial importance to the nation's best-known drug gangs. A city of approximately 1.7 million, Tijuana is the largest city on the US-Mexico border, and by far the largest conduit to the US West Coast. This makes it the perfect weigh station for Mexican drugs headed for consumers in California.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Violence Over Coca Eradication in Peru Leaves 7 Injured. Violent clashes between coca growers and police in central Peru have left at least seven people injured as tensions mount over President Ollanta Humala's policy of expanding coca eradication. Trouble began when Police tried to enter a coca growing area in the province of Oxapampa in the region of Pasco, reportedly to carry out an operation related to drug flights. Believing the agents had come to eradicate coca crops, the growers blocked the road to prevent their entry, reported Peru21. According to an anonymous source cited by Correo , the growers lifted the blockade after meeting with police, but later a group apparently spurred on by drug traffickers turned on the police, and attacked them with sticks and rocks. Four police and three citizens were reported wounded in the skirmishes. Tensions between coca growing communities and the authorities have long been a feature of Peruvian drug control efforts. The situation has deteriorated under Humala due to the president's dramatic policy U-turn over coca eradication. As a candidate he pledged not to carry out forced eradications but as president he has taken a hardline approach that has involved a massive scaling up of eradication operations. This is not the first time tensions have exploded into violence. In August last year two people died after police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at a crowd of growers trying to block their path. With eradication set to increase by 50 percent in 2013, and the government launching a rhetorical onslaught against growers , incidents such as these are likely to become more common.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
Why Mennonite Links to Mexico Cartels Are Nothing New. Revelations of links between Mennonite communities and cartels from Mexico have garnered international attention recently. Yet while the ties are nothing new, details of the connection point to an evolving relationship. The latest development came on April 25 when Jacob Fehr, a member of Mexico's Mennonite community who had relocated to Canada, was sentenced to seven years in prison for trafficking cocaine, reported CBC News. Fehr was reportedly making his third trip from Chihuahua, Mexico, to Alberta, Canada for a cartel when he was caught with two kilos of the drug in his car. Canadian authorities have expressed concern over the links, while a Drugs Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent warned of the danger of cartel violence spreading to Canada as a result. Reports of Mennonites -- a pacifist Christian group that began relocating from the United States and Canada to Mexico in the early 1900s -- working with Mexican cartels date back to the 1980s , when members of Mexico's Mennonite community began trafficking marijuana inside cheese, furniture and the tires of vehicles headed to Canada. Over the next six years, US and Canadian officials arrested dozens of Mennonites for their involvement in drug trafficking and in the mid-1990s marijuana farms were discovered on Mennonite territory in Mexico. In 2013, six Mennonites with ties to the Juarez Cartel were charged with drug trafficking for attempting to bring marijuana to the United States and cocaine to Canada. They were reportedly part of a larger operation that included three Mennonites arrested in 2012 for similar charges. Mennonite communities in Belize have also been accused of building clandestine airstrips for cartels in this country. Whereas most of the reports of Mennonites trafficking drugs in the 1990s involved marijuana, recent cases suggest a shift towards transporting cocaine. Due to the geographic distance and number of border crossings between Mexico and Canada, a kilo of cocaine fetches at least twice as much in Canada as it does in the United States. Fears of cartel violence overspill stem from a 2010 drug dispute in Alberta that resulted in a fatal shooting. Although both the shooter and the victim were Mexican nationals, the crime occurred on Canadian soil and was tied to a Mennonite group in southern Alberta. While Isolated incidents of cartel violence in the United States and Canada are not unheard of, widespread bloodletting remains extremely unlikely.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Killings of Women Track Rising Violence in Mexicos Drug War. Murders of women in Mexico more than doubled in the years following the launch of President Felipe Calderon's war on drugs, with the highest increases occurring in regions most affected by organized crime, according to a government study. A study carried out by Mexico's National Commission to Prevent and Eradicate Violence against Women (CONAVIM) showed a correlation between the rise in femicides -- used in this case to denote any murder of a woman -- and the violence unleashed by the drug trade. The report showed that between the years 2001 and 2010, the femicide rate grew by over 500 percent in the northeast and around 280 percent in the northwest -- corresponding to the states historically most affected by drug-related violence, including Chihuahua, Durango, Nuevo Leon, Sinaloa and Sonora. The number of killings of women more than doubled in the three years after then-President Calderon launched his assault on criminal groups, rising from 1,119 in 2007 to 2,471 in 2010. Between 1980 and 2010 women made up 10 percent of total homicides in Mexico. Firearms were the most common cause of death, accounting for nearly 24 percent of women's killings in 2010. The study's coordinator, Florinda Riquer Fernandez, said that the lack of security in conflict zones made women more vulnerable, creating the conditions for gender-based violence, reported El Informador. The study's finding that the rise in violence against women has accompanied the acceleration of Mexico's drug conflict is a reminder of how organized crime can impact on social order and vulnerable populations, even if they are not involved with criminal groups. In 2011 a women's advocacy group reported that most Mexican female migrants to the US said they were leaving to escape violence and insecurity. Among the dangers facing them were high numbers of femicides -- in this context gender-based killings of women -- along the Mexico-US border, as well as the threat of being forced into the sex industry. Central American countries like El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, also home to high levels of drug-related violence, rank among the most dangerous places in the world for women. 	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
Weekly InSight: Outlook for Anti-Graft Initiatives in Honduras and Guatemala. In our February 1 Facebook Live session, InSight Crime Co-Director Steven Dudley and Managing Editor Josefina Salomon addressed the current status and outlook of anti-corruption initiatives taking place in Honduras and Guatemala. During the interview, Dudley provided details of some of the obstacles that anti-corruption initiatives are currently facing in both countries, muddying the short-term outlook for these efforts. He also talked about how the coming appointment of new attorneys general in both countries will be critical to determining how these initiatives proceed. In addition, both Salomon and Dudley discussed the role of the United States, and the vague rhetoric emanating from Washington regarding US support for the ongoing anti-corruption initiatives in both countries.

"Mexicos Queen of the  Pacific Acquitted. Sandra Avila Beltran, better known to the Mexican media as the ""Queen of the Pacific,"" and her love interest, Colombian Juan Diego Espinosa Ramirez, alias ""El Tigre,"" were acquitted last week by a Mexican federal court of drug trafficking and organized crime charges. Avila Beltran and Espinosa (who was a member of the Norte del Valle cartel in Colombia) were arrested in September of 2007. Authorities accused them of working with the Sinaloa cartel and the Norte del Valle cartel to smuggle illicit drugs into the United States. Espinosa was extradited to the United States and has cooperated with U.S. authorities. But Avila Beltran's extradition has stalled, and the possibility she could go free could put a thorn into U.S.-Mexican relations. Mexico's El Proceso reports that a judge of Mexico's 18th District Court last Friday ruled that the evidence presented by the Attorney General ""did not establish the circumstances of time, manner, place and occasion"" in which the crimes were committed. Despite her acquittal, Avila Beltran will remain in prison while she awaits the decision about her extradition. Mexico has extradited over 350 suspected criminals to the United States since President Felipe Calderon took power in December 2006. The list includes some of the most sought after cartel leaders, such as Osiel Cardenas, the former head of the Gulf Cartel, extradited in 2007. But for every top-level capo extradited from Mexico, there's an equally high-level cartel member who the U.S. has requested that remains in a Mexican jail or whose extradition request was rejected outright. This includes the case of Alfredo Beltran Leyva, a leader of the Beltran Leyva Organization, who was arrested in January 2008. "	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Brazil Border Patrols Not Enough to Control Crime, Drugs: Police. Brazil's efforts to combat drug trafficking and organized crime by reinforcing border security have not been effective enough, say police, highlighting the difficulty of securing a massive border that touches all of the continent's major drug producers. Oslain Santana, head of the Brazilian police's organized crime unit, said Brazil's ""Strategic Border Plan"" had seen results, but more needed to be done, reported O Globo. Santana highlighted the need for more intelligence work to determine who was trafficking and buying drugs in the major consumer markets of the southeast, south and northeast of the country. ""The flow of drugs passes through the border but it's destined for the [internal] consumer market,"" he said. Professor Alcides Vaz of the Universidade de Brasilia's International Relations Institute attributed the continued difficulties in controlling the borders to ""structural problems,"" including the sheer size of the border, the strength of crime and institutional weaknesses in the border states. To deal with these issues, the government has been increasing security investment in the country's 11 border states, reported O Globo. Brazil's approximately 17,000 kilometer border touches Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia, South America's three coca-producing nations, and Paraguay, the continent's biggest marijuana producer. The country also hosts a major drug consumer market and serves as a common jump-off point for cocaine shipments destined for Europe, making its porous borders prime drug trafficking territory. In the face of this geographical vulnerability, President Dilma Rousseff named border security as her government's top priority. Since July 2011, the administration has pumped funds and equipment into the Strategic Border Plan, and on multiple occasions, the president has highlighted the success of the initiative. The plan has also involved border security agreements with countries including Bolivia, Colombia and Venezuela, but has simultaneously provoked tensions with neighbors concerned that the initiative may infringe on their sovereignty. Brazil's aggressive interdiction, surveillance and eradication campaigns bear comparison to the strategies employed and supported by the United States. As the continent's rising economic giant, Brazil likely feels a similar threat posed by foreign crime and a need to exert its authority. However, the focus on closing borders does not address the country's numerous internal security problems, including powerful and increasingly transnational prison gangs and rising violence outside its major cities. It also fails to address the institutional weaknesses that have allowed violence and crime to proliferate."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Navy Finds 32 Alleged Victims of Zeta Killers in Veracruz. Authorities in the east Mexican city of Veracruz reported the discovery of 32 bodies, thought to have been murdered by the Mata Zetas, in three houses in the city. On Thursday the navy announced the discovery of 20 bodies, 17 men and three women, in a house in the area of Jardines de Mocambo. A matter of hours later, according to another navy report, officers located another 11 dead bodies in a property in the Costa Verde district of the city, and one other in a house in the upmarket Costa de Oro neighborhood. The security forces were led to the bodies by alleged members of the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG), who make up a self-described paramilitary force known as the ""Mata Zetas"" or Zeta killers. Eight suspected members of this group were arrested Thursday, as were 12 suspected Zetas. The killings follow the dumping of 35 bodies on one of the city's main streets on September 20, along with a sign threatening to kill all Zetas in the state. Over the last six months violence in Veracruz state has intensified as drug gangs including the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel have battled for control of the key drug trafficking ""plaza."" The deaths come just two days after the Mexican government announced plans to send additional federal police and military troops to Veracruz state under a unified command, in an attempt to bring drug violence under control.

"Majority of Mexico Police Force Unfit for Service. The majority of police officers across Mexico have been found unfit for duty three years after the government established a firm timeframe to reform the entire institution, showing a lack of political will to improve a force in dire need of rehabilitation. Today, 75 percent of Mexico's 330,776 active local and federal police officials are not certified for duty after the government in 2016 agreed on a three-year window to certify all such forces for police work, which ended in early September, Animal Politico reported. Under the country's National Public Security Law, more than 246,000 police officers lacking official certification shouldn't even be working at all. Of Mexico's 32 states, just five reported that more than half of their police members were certified: Queretaro and Durango (75 percent), Colima (60 percent), Guanajuato and Campeche (between 50 and 55 percent), according to Animal Politico. The police force in the capital, Mexico City, was among those with the lowest certification rates, with around nine percent of officers meeting the required criteria for active duty. In southwest Guerrero state, just 8.3 percent of officers are certified, while in the small state of Tlaxcala just east of Mexico City, a shockingly low 20 of more than 3,200 officers were fit for duty. Mexico's police force has long been underinvested in and extremely vulnerable to targeted attacks. The latest report comes amid an unrelenting wave of violence. In August of 2019, nearly 80 people were murdered every day across the country. The continued failure to reform Mexico's police force comes at a time when insecurity has spiraled out of control and citizens are again opting to take up arms in the absence of an effective security force to protect them. But issues with Mexico's police force are deeply rooted and did not begin with the current administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. However, instead of allocating resources for professionalization, training and equipment to the existing security forces in need of reform, the head of state opted for the creation of a militarized National Guard force that has been unable to stem the violence or protect citizens. As the body count through the first half of 2019 soared to over 17,000 , putting Mexico on pace to log yet another record-setting year of violence, citizens in areas wracked by organized crime have taken matters into their own hands. In Tepalcatepec, a municipality sitting on the border between Michoacan and Jalisco states where the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion -- CJNG) and a rival group are battling for control , locals have armed themselves in the absence of government protection. ""We're not criminals. We're producers, business owners, parents who, although it hurts, are doing the government's security work,"" one local day laborer told El Universal. The security situation is so dire that not only are Mexico's police officers ill-equipped to protect the country's most at-risk communities, but also themselves. At least 272 officers have been killed so far in 2019, and in 2018, one officer was killed every day , according to the non-governmental organization Causa en Comun."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"The New Wave: Organized Crime and Displacement in Mexico and Central America. Violence from organized crime groups is forcibly displacing hundreds of thousands of people in Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Stories of individuals having to flee their homes are rife, and recounted across society from the stylish cafes of the wealthy elite to the dusty pulperias (corner stores) in remote and humble neighborhoods. Few lives remain untouched by this epidemic of forced dislocation sweeping the region. Earlier this month US President Barack Obama labeled as a ""humanitarian crisis"" the huge increase in unaccompanied children pouring into the United States from the Northern Triangle countries, put at 47,017 since October 2013. This rise of 92 percent over the same period last year, added White House director of domestic policy, Cecilia Munoz, reflected ""an increase in sustained violence"" as well as worsening poverty. The children fleeing El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras represent just one group of people displaced by the violence that plagues these Northern Triangle nations and Mexico, most of whom have no option but to remain in their terrifying environments. In Mexico, where violence is the most visible, 1.65 million individuals were driven from their homes in the five years between 2006 and 2011 -- equivalent to two per cent of the country's population -- according to preliminary data by Parametria, a Mexican think tank. Translated annually, an average of 330,000 Mexicans had to leave their homes in each of the five years. A study carried out by the Universidad Autonoma de Ciudad Juarez showed that in the city of Ciudad Juarez alone, around 230,000 people fled in just three years between 2007 and 2010 with about half leaving the country and crossing the nearby border into the United States. This is an abbreviated version of an article that appeared in the Refugee Survey Quarterly. It was reprinted with permission. See full article here. In El Salvador the scale of displacement was similarly high in 2012, the most recent year for which figures are available, with 2.1 percent of the population forced to move as the result of violence. Out of these approximately 130,000 individuals, nearly one-third felt compelled to leave their homes two or more times. This rate of displacement compares to levels seen during the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980s and to those now experienced in the armed conflict in Colombia, the latter widely considered a humanitarian emergency. No comparable data exists for neighbouring Honduras and Guatemala but these nations' astronomical homicide rates, the former having the world's highest murder rate according to a recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), point to a similar level of displacement. The region is in the grip of a humanitarian disaster with the past few years witnessing what appears to be an unprecedented level of displacement. Yet the governments of these countries are virtually silent. The problem of displaced people is viewed as a security matter and often regarded through the lens of the political conflicts that raged here in the 1980s. The subject is also politically sensitive making constructive conversations difficult. Finally, the nature and patterns of this current wave of displacement are vastly complex and poorly understood. A key misconception is that the perpetrators of displacement in the region form a single entity: ""organized crime."" The truth is that three main criminal groups propel people to leave home: street gangs, Mexican drug cartels and drug transporters. The street gangs and Mexican drug cartels are responsible for the lion's share of displacement. The gangs, largely consisting of maras, operate in El Salvador and Honduras, and to a lesser extent in Guatemala. The Mexican drug cartels conduct operations mainly in rural and semi-rural Mexico and increasingly in nearby cities and the countryside of the Northern Triangle. The drug transporters, or ""transportistas,"" displace comparatively few people and are based primarily in rural Guatemala and Honduras. The Maras The mara street gangs originated in the jails of California and swiftly resort to violence to control people living in cities in the Northern Triangle. The two biggest rival gangs are the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha (MS13). At the heart of each gang is the clique or ""clica"" whose members direct the gang's criminal activities such as extortion -- the gang's lifeblood- and drug dealing. The clica aims to exercise exclusive control over a specific territory that it defends against rival gangs. The territory encompasses a core zone in which the clica members live -- typically a poor neighborhood -- and the extended zone, which may include marginal as well as affluent areas. The clicas make sporadic forays into the latter often to extort businesses. Any perceived challenge to the clica's control can earn the ""offender"" a death sentence. A shop owner who refuses to pay a mara extortion demand, a girl who rejects the attentions of a gang member or a person seen talking to the police all risk being killed. Even attending a school in a neighborhood controlled by a rival mara can be construed as an act of disloyalty. So intense is the paranoia of some clicas that simply a ""wrong"" look can have fatal consequences. Fear of death causes a steady stream of individuals to flee their homes in the cities of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. That fear may be free-floating and not linked to a specific incident. A mother who is anxious that her growing children may attract the attention of the local clica may move her family to another neighborhood. Similarly, residents may feel forced to search for safer surroundings if the near-constant threat of violence becomes psychologically unbearable. Intensely violent disputes between gangs also force city dwellers to abandon their homes in the Northern Triangle. Shoot-outs over territory regularly erupt between the Barrio 18 and MS13 maras, between maras and other gangs and even between clicas of the same gang. Gun battles between maras may be so frequent that residents resort to using wooden boards in their windows instead of glass. In the face of an invading gang, some clicas will order individuals without family members in the resident clica to leave their homes or be killed. If the ruling clica is defeated, family members and supporters of that clica have to flee to avoid reprisals from the victorious gang. Displacement is also caused by a general hardening of mara attitudes toward inhabitants reflecting gang members' increased anxiety. Extortion quotas may be raised and any refusals met with immediate death, with no warning given. The destinations of people driven from their neighborhoods vary according to their income. Poorer residents have no choice but to go to other impoverished areas, usually in the same city, although some move to other cities in the same country. The most financially hard-pressed families without support from extended family can wind up either living on the street or in degrading and vulnerable conditions in distant squatter zones. Better-off residents tend to stay in the same city knowing that they can leave their country altogether -- typically for the United States -- if their circumstances worsen. Drug Cartels Drug cartels drive the displacement epidemic in Mexico. Like the maras, cartels intimidate the local population into submission through extreme violence on a daily basis. Anyone found to be ""disloyal"" or resistant to their demands, runs the risk of being killed. Also like the maras, cartels seek to exercise exclusive control over territory in which they conduct criminal activities. The cartels, however, with their superior firepower, resources and position in the drug trade, far outstrip the maras in their capacity to inflict violence and displace inhabitants. The massive displacements that have afflicted Mexico for the past ten years largely reflect territorial disputes between increasingly ruthless and heavily armed cartels. Traditionally, Mexican cartels were rooted in strategically important areas of the country and led by local families. Starting in the 1990s, however, cartels fragmented and become more militarized, and sought to establish total control over territories through which drugs are trafficked. Cartels also began assuming a dominant regional role as drug owners and managers. In addition, many, especially the newer ones, diversified into extortion and charging taxes on various local criminal activities. Gun battles between these more sophisticated cartels dramatically heighten the insecurity for those people unfortunate enough to live in their midst, causing entire villages to empty out in terror. Such mass displacements are also used intentionally to reduce local sympathy -- thus logistical and intelligence support -- for the rival by an invading cartel. In the past two years, elements linked to the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) have forced out villagers across the rural mountain zone of Sinaloa state, the cradle of the famed Sinaloa Cartel. Similarly, the Zetas criminal organization has displaced entire towns assumed to support the Gulf Cartel along the drug-running corridor from Nuevo Leon State on the USA border. For its part, the Gulf Cartel has taken away individuals suspected of having links with the Zetas in towns from the neighboring Tamaulipas State causing a substantial number of families to abandon their homes. Although many of the extremely violent confrontations between cartels take place in rural zones through which drugs are transported, the populations of nearby cities are increasingly affected as well as rural areas of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Those people displaced in Mexico tend to move to Mexico City and to other urban areas of Federal States less affected by cartel violence, including southern states such as Chiapas. Mexico's vibrant economy and greater size, when compared to the Northern Triangle countries, give residents a wider variety of options for relocation. Mexicans are also more likely to be better off financially than their southern counterparts and a substantial number of them emigrate to other countries, principally the United States. Transportistas The drug transporters, or transportistas, in rural Honduras and Guatemala, displace far fewer people than either the maras or drug cartels. Their business of smuggling does not depend on exclusive control of territories but the ability to move through them unimpeded. Thus, armed disputes between transportistas are rare. Furthermore, their relationship with the local population is based less on fear and violence -- at least in the first instance -- and more on buying their tolerance. Transportistas do resort to violence or the threat or it, to force small and medium landowners to sell their land in strategic cross-border smuggling zones if met with refusal. Sometimes the sum offered is a small fortune while at others, it is paltry. Families forced off their land in Guatemala and Honduras tend to move to the outskirts of towns in the region or to rural areas, such as forestry reserves, to seek work as laborers. Small numbers of individuals and families are also driven from their homes because they are viewed as enemies by one of the transportista groups. These people usually migrate to the capital cities where they hope to either secure State protection or lose themselves in the multitudes. Most are keen to travel to another country, usually the United States, to escape the continuing risk of assassination, but only some have the financial resources to do so. The scale and intensity of the wave of people displaced through violence at the hands of criminal groups in Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala leave little doubt of the pressing need for an effective humanitarian policy response. To date, only Honduras has taken the first step toward formulating a coherent national policy by creating the Inter-Institutional Commission for the Protection of Persons Displaced by Violence in November 2013. Certain Northern Triangle governments openly acknowledge their inability to protect particular groups of people at risk of criminal violence. The Northern Triangle countries are financially disadvantaged and institutionally weak yet, along with Mexico, they face a human tragedy of epic proportions. These nations should not be expected to have to address alone the forced displacement of their people. It is timely to ask whether a Central and North American initiative could benefit the victims of these unofficial theatres of war. *Cantor is the Director of the Refugee Law Initiative, School of Advanced Study, University of London.

"International Drug Ring Busted in Dominican Republic. Officials broke up an international drug trafficking ring in the Dominican Republic, providing yet another indication of the country's growing role in the trafficking of drugs through the Caribbean. According to Agencia EFE , a joint operation between the anti-drug agency of the Dominican Republic and the US Coast Guard on the morning of December 10 led to the seizure of ten parcels of cocaine from a boat off the southeastern coast. Authorities said that another 800 kilograms had been tossed overboard before their arrival. A Colombian citizen was captured along with the intercepted shipment, while three others, including one Dominican and two suspects of unknown nationality were arrested in separate raids in the capital of Santo Domingo. Police have identified the Dominican as Jose Calderon Rijo, alias ""La Arana,"" and say he led the group that trafficked Colombian cocaine through the Caribbean, while posing as an entrepreneur in the entertainment industry. In response to heightened security along the US-Mexico border, traffickers have begun to rely more heavily on sea routes through the Caribbean, along which the Dominican Republic is a key transit point. A US Congressional report released in September found that the amount of drugs passing through the Caribbean is once more the rise, though it is still nowhere near its peak in the 1980s, when some 80 percent of US-bound cocaine went through the region. Another contributor to this trend is the United States military's implentation of so-called Operation Martillo in February 2012, which has raised pressure on criminal enterprises in Central America and made the Caribbean route more attractive. Much of this traffic is headed by foreign criminal groups. In 2012 alone, Dominican authorities arrested traffickers from Colombia, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and even the Czech Republic. The identification of La Arana as the head of this international network, however, goes against this trend. It also contradicts the claim made in July by Dominican drug czar Marino Castillo, who said that foreigners were almost to blame for the country's security problems. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Organized Crime Behind Spiking Homicides in Mexicos Most Violent Municipalities. Mexico's security strategy for its 50 most violent municipalities has largely failed to bear fruit after six months, as criminal dynamics are still fueling increasing rates of homicides despite targeted government efforts. Six months after the launch of a special security strategy for the 50 most violent municipalities in Mexico, the number of homicides registered between September 2016 and February 2017 increased in 37 of the municipalities in comparison to the number of murders seen during the same period of the previous year, reported Animal Politico on March 27. At the end of August 2016, President Enrique Pena Nieto said that 42 percent of all homicides in Mexico so far that year were concentrated in just 2 percent of municipalities. This concentration of violence prompted the launch of a security strategy for the 50 most affected municipalities, with the aim of strengthening social prevention programs and institutions. The president also said that state governors and local officials should take greater responsibility in public security, while assuring continued support from federal forces and announcing plans for greater coordination between federal and local forces. But six months after the announcement, the figures revealed by Animal Politico show that homicides decreased in only 12 of the 50 targeted municipalities, and stayed level in one of them. Moreover, of the ten municipalities with the highest increase, eight saw their homicide rate more than double, including three municipalities where the figure tripled or more. The municipality with the largest increase in its homicide rate was Tecoman, in the state of Colima. Due to the nearly 300 percent increase in murders in the municipality, the federal government sent 500 military police in February 2017 to secure the area. Colima's Security Secretary Francisco Javier Castano Suarez said the spiking violence was the result of a war between the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG), reported AF Medios. Last year, the state of Colima as a whole had already suffered spiking levels of violence, with homicide figures registered in April 2016 showing a 940 percent increase in comparison to April 2015. As InSight Crime explained , this outbreak of violence was linked to confrontations between the Sinaloa Cartel and the CJNG. Similarly, confrontations between criminal groups appear to be the source of violence in the two municipalities of the Chihuahua state, Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua. However, in those cases the actors driving the violence are more likely local gangs rather than transnational organizations. According El Universal , a local judicial official argued that similar turf wars between local gangs dedicated to microtrafficking may have largely fueled violence in the port town of Mazatlan, Sinaloa, which suffered a 159 percent increase in homicides. But a media report from La Jornada argued that the violence in the strategically important area may instead have stemmed from a conflict between the Beltran Leyva Organization, allied with the CJNG, and the Sinaloa Cartel. Unconfirmed reports in October 2016 also pointed to an offensive by the CJNG against the Sinaloa Cartel in Baja California Sur as being responsible for the violence that has shaken the state's capital La Paz, which saw a 77 percent increase in its homicide rate. Many of the most violent municipalities appear in states that have long been some of organized crime's strongest footholds, such as Tamaulipas , where more than 90 percent of homicides are reportedly linked to organized crime. One of Tamaulipas' two most violent municipalities, Reynosa, is not only located along the US-Mexico border, but also in the Burgos Basin , Mexico's largest gas field, which means the city provides ample criminal opportunities for drug trafficking and fuel theft. Reynosa also remains the epicenter of confrontations between rival groups and security elements targeting criminal leaders. And in addition to cartel struggles in Tamaulipas, the other violent municipality, Ciudad Victoria, witnessed a local political transition in mid-2016 that may have also contributed to rising violence, due to possible realignments between criminal groups and corrupt officials. Similarly, organized crime has long been deeply established in the states of Guerrero and Michoacan, which appear along with Tamaulipas in the top five most deadly states for deployed military elements. Several municipalities in both states have experienced rising homicides despite the implementation of the government's 50-city strategy. Michoacan and Guerrero have both also suffered from the ongoing presence of vigilante groups and competing drug cartels that have fought for control over the states' rich agricultural lands, which are exploited to cultivate poppy and marijuana. Guerrero's State Attorney General recently admitted that the authorities were powerless against organized crime in the state, which has become the epicenter of Mexico's opium poppy cultivation. The targeted security strategy does appear to have been successful in certain municipalities such as Acapulco in Guerrero, Monterrey in Nuevo Leon or Puebla in the state of the same name. The respective decreases of roughly 15, 33 and 35 percent in the homicide rates in these municipalities are significant, given that these three areas have been at the heart of feuds between rival criminal groups vying for control of illicit economies. But the few and rather slight security improvements are largely overshadowed by the extreme rise in homicides in numerous municipalities. And this dynamic serves as a reminder that Mexico's security institutions continue to struggle to rein in violence in areas of states that have traditionally been hotbeds for organized crime. SEE ALSO : Mexico News and Profiles In October 2016, a report argued that more than half of Mexico's homicides were linked to organize crime. Certain states, such as Baja California Sur, Tamaulipas or Michoacan, not only present very high percentages of organized crime-related murders, but they are also the location of some of the municipalities with the highest increase in homicide rates. In addition and as previously described, recent reports have portrayed various shifts in criminal dynamics in the most violent aforementioned municipalities. This would suggest that, despite government efforts, evolutions in the criminal world are still largely responsible for spiking concentrated violence. Indeed, the 50-city strategy may have been flawed from the start. Already in September 2016, the special plan was being criticized for being extremely vague with regard to prevention programs, and for resembling earlier policies whose efficiency -- or lack thereof -- had not been rigorously assessed, according to experts cited by Animal Politico. For example, Francisco Rivas, the director of the National Citizen Observatory (director General del Observatorio Nacional Ciudadano ), pointed that out that many of the municipalities already received substantial federal funding for strenghtening security institutions, without any evaulation of how efficiently the money was spent. And in addition, security expert Alejandro Hope noted that the policy made no mention of strengthening the Attorney General's Office nor District Attorney Offices, which play key roles in reducing insecurity in the long term.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"US Deploying Drones To Counter Caribbean Drug Traffickers. US authorities declared they are expanding the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or ""drones,"" to track drug trafficking in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sources have confirmed that drones are being deployed to trace drug trafficking movements in the Caribbean due to the inability of previously utilized technologies*to meet surveillance requirements,*reported the Caribbean Media Corporation. For example, the P-3 Orion, a large manned-aircraft used for surveillance, can only operate for ten hours whereas a drone is able to ""loiter"" for twice as long. DHS officials stated that drug traffickers in the Caribbean are increasingly turning to semi-submersibles and making night trips with go-fast boats to move narcotics. Statistics from the DHS showed that since 2011, the US has interdicted five semi-submersibles in the region. However, this is only a fraction of the amount believed to be travelling through the Caribbean. The executive director of air national security operations for DHS Customs and Border Protection said, ""It doesn't matter what the target is. It matters that we are able to stay out and look for it,"" adding that one of the drones, the Guardian, will be mounted with infrared sensors, enabling night flights. According to the LA Times , the DHS has been testing its drones over the Bahamas for 18 months in preparation for expanding their use to the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. While Homeland Security officials pointed out to the CMC that drones have twice the loiter time of a P-3 Orion, they failed to address another key issue: cost. According to a report by the Economist, a drone can require up to 20 ground crew members in a supporting role, significantly more than a manned aircraft. What's more, the US Coast Guard, for example, can launch helicopters from its boats for surveillance. Drones do not have this luxury, needing the use of runways. Simply expanding the use of piloted aircraft, therefore, could be more cost-effective than the use of drones. The DHS already uses drones along the US-Mexico border in drug and migrant interdiction functions. To date, the craft have had a minor impact on border security, contributing to the capture of less than two percent of the undocumented migrants apprehended on the US' southwestern border in the 2011 fiscal year.

"Colombia Extradites Norte del Valle Cartel Boss. In what amounts to a final chapter in the history of the once-mighty Norte del Valle Cartel, Colombia has extradited one of the organization's former leaders to the United States.

Quintero was arrested on April 15, and is wanted in the United States on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.

"Mexico Drug Gang Behind Guatemala Massacre?The slaughter and decapitation of at least 27 people at a farm in north Guatemala is likely part of the brutal conflict between Mexico's Zetas and local gang the Leones, who are battling for control of the region. Witnesses said that the killers, numbering between 30 and 40 men, arrived in pickups and four-by-fours to carry out the attack, reports elPeriodico. The bodies were discovered just a day after the murder of Haroldo Waldemar Leon, one of the remaining heavyweights of the Leones, elsewhere in the state of Peten. It's not clear who is behind the attack. The authorities are investigating two possible explanations; that the Zetas carried out the massacre as part of the same operation that killed Leon, or that the Leones did it as retaliation for their boss' murder. Most reports blame the Zetas, and the country's interior minister told press that a cell of that group, known as Zeta 200, had reportedly been looking for the owner of the farm where the killing took place. In response, the government sent ""dozens"" of federal troops to the area to prevent the shooters fleeing into Mexico. However, given Peten's proximity to the frontier, the density of the terrain, and the several hundred miles of border in that region, this appears unlikely to succeed. (See Prensa Libre's video report below) The Leon clan, formerly dominant along Guatemala's eastern border with El Salvador and Honduras, has been locked into a battle with other local gangs and with the Zetas for the past several years. The gang got its start as a ring of cattle and car thieves, before moving into narcotics by robbing drug shipments, typically belonging to the Mendoza and Lorenzana organizations , that passed through the city of Zacapa. The leader of the group, Juan Jose Leon, also known as Juancho, was gunned down along with ten others in 2008, an event that precipitated the Leones' decline in power in Guatemala's underworld. Fourteen men linked to the Zetas were eventually convicted of carrying out the massacre in which Juancho was killed. The Zetas, native to Tamaulipas state in Mexico, are developing an increasing international presence, with links in countries from Europe to Central America as well as in neighboring Guatemala. Most recently, the Zetas have been linked to an increase in violence in the Guatemalan state of Alta Verapaz, which borders Peten. As a consequence of the rising bloodshed, Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom sent the army to Alta Verapaz in December, declaring a ""state of siege."" In January, he announced the creation of a three-nation task force to combat the Zetas and other Mexican gangs in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The siege may have had little permanent impact. A Plaza Publica report documented the return of the Zetas to the town of Coban after the measure ended on February 19, murdering a businessman and torching a car shop. Peten, where the recent massacre took place, accounts for roughly a third of Guatemala's total area. It is a rural state that shares a long (and largely unpatrolled) border with Mexico, and has also seen a significant upsurge in violence in recent months, with Governor Rudel Alvarez calling in February for a state of siege like the one that brought the army to Alta Verapaz. The exact relationship between the Zetas operating in Mexico and those in Guatemala remains a subject of debate. Some evidence suggests that the Mexican group is merely co-operating with local gangs. Of 22 alleged Zetas arrested in Alta Verapaz in December , for instance, only one was Mexican. Furthermore, while the Zetas were responsible for attacks on revelers in Morelia during Mexico's 2008 independence day celebration, indiscriminate attacks against civilians have been rare. However, others say that the Zetas are exercising direct control in the region rather than just supporting local allies, and that the failure to arrest Mexican Zetas is merely evidence of how ineffective the government's response has been. While Guatemala is valuable terrain for moving cocaine from Colombia to Mexico, the Zetas' criminal activities in the Central American country demonstrate a focus on territorial control that transcends mere smuggling, much as has been the case with the gang's work in Mexico. According to Plaza Publica, the Zetas have begun to intimidate local business owners in Guatemala and are seeking to take over virtually all facets of local crime, including extortion, local drug distribution and money laundering.

"Colombia Troop Surge in Narino: Too Little Too Late?Authorities are following through on a promised security surge in southwest Colombia, one of the most troubled areas in the country. But it is not clear what the government hopes to achieve, considering that a similar operation in northern Colombia produced very few results. President Juan Manuel Santos said that 1,400 police officers will be deployed to the Narino, Cauca, and Valle del Cauca departments, perhaps the most conflict-ridden area in Colombia right now. Accompanying the police surge is the creation of a naval brigade, based in Tumaco, Narino, a port city highly valued by drug-trafficking organization (DTO) the Rastrojos. This bit of attention for Narino, one of the poorest and most violent departments in Colombia, is a welcome step forward. All of Colombia's armed actors are present in this area: rebel groups the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ) and the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN ); and DTOs like the Rastrojos and Aguilas Negras. Narino is a highly valued strategic holding ground for criminal groups: some of Colombia's densest coca cultivations are found here. After the government stepped up fumigation efforts in neighboring Putumayo in 2002, coca production shifted westwards into Narino. According to the most recently available statistics on Colombia's coca production , in 2009 the United Nations (UN) counted 16,228 hectares of coca in Narino, compared to Putumayo's 5,316. The department's southern border with Ecuador and over 60 miles of coastline along the Pacific also makes Narino a vital holding ground for both the rebels and criminal bands (bandas criminales - BACRIMS). Key to controlling Narino is Tumaco, which, with an estimated 4,681 hectares of coca, is the municipality with the highest concentration of coca crops in the country. In the district capital, local gangs fight over micro-trafficking profits, contributing to a murder rate of 139 per every 100,000 inhabitants, compared with the national murder rate of 33. These kinds of numbers led Defense Minister Rodrigo Rivera to promise in January that the government would soon launch an ""intervention"" in Narino, with a focus on securing Tumaco. Committing additional forces in Colombia's Pacific southwest is a welcome development. But it's unclear if the number of troops and the proposed time -- six months -- is enough to achieve long-lasting results. The surge is called ""Operation Troy,"" after a similarly dubbed operation launched January in the northern departments of Cordoba and Antioquia. The government has praised the results of this two-month assault, which include the reported arrest of 236 presumed BACRIM members. But many of these arrests were of low-level BACRIM members who worked as local drug dealers. We can also assume the courts will allow many to walk away on a technicality (as occurred with the much-publicized case of one member of the Paisas , Oscar Mauricio Galvis, alias ""Pantera,"" who was arrested in 2010 and promptly set free by a local judge ). To definitively break the cycles of violence in Narino will require much more than a six-month military and police surge. But the government's resources are increasingly stretched. The FARC are leading offensives in Cauca and Arauca, while the Urabeno-Rastrojo war threatens to boost violence in major cities like Medellin and Cali. This makes it unlikely that Narino will see much more from the government than the currently promised aid. Narino is a long neglected corner of the country, which has helped turn it into a center for Colombia's coca cultivation. This makes the current attention from Bogota a step forward. But the new ""Plan Troy"" may amount to little more than a Band-Aid on a gaping wound. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombias Wild West: Gold, Prostitutes and Urabenos. Three years ago, Buritica was a sleepy farming village tucked away in the mountains of Antioquia in northwest Colombia. Now, it is a gold rush frontier town replete with deathtrap mines, ramshackle huts, prostitutes, drugs, and narco-paramilitaries -- a metamorphosis that could become ever more common as Colombia's illegal gold miners, who have their roots in the country's civil conflict, seek new opportunities. No one in Buritica really knows how it all began. Some say the illegal miners followed on the heels of Canadian mining company Continental Gold. Others say it came after a TV documentary publicized the revival of legal gold mining in the region. Still others say an influential figure from the illegal mining heartland of northeast Antioquia spread word of the opportunities on offer. However, everyone agrees on one point: the people of Buritica have lost their town. Officially, the municipality of Buritica (in Colombia, the capital city of the municipality carries the same name) has a population of just over 7,000 people. However, officials and residents say it is probably closer to 12,000. Most of the new residents have descended from municipalities of Segovia, Remedios and Amalfi in the northwestern state of Antioquia that have a long history of illegal mining linked to organized crime. Predominantly young single men, they brought with them dangerous and damaging illegal mining techniques and a thirst for quick money and fast living. Accompanying them were the overseers of much of Colombia's illegal mining trade -- the narco-paramilitary groups known as the BACRIM (from ""Bandas Criminales"" or ""Criminal Bands""). Working Under the Urabenos While local government officials said they had no official confirmation of what they believe -- that the BACRIM control the mining sector -- residents are more forthcoming. ""We known the miners are with others, they have the support of other groups,"" said one local community leader, who did not wish to be indentified for security reasons. ""We can't say anything about the situation because those that are higher up will come, so we have to keep quiet."" According to Colombian conflict monitoring group Indepaz, which produces the country's most detailed annual breakdown of the presence of the BACRIM, two groups, the Urabenos and the Rastrojos, first appeared in Buritica sometime in 2011. However, these days, the Urabenos are the real power in the region. Antioquia is one of the group's strongholds, while the now fractured Rastrojos have not maintained a serious presence in the state since ceding control of their mining interests in the north as part of a 2011 pact. The Urabenos presence in Buritica was also confirmed in 2012 with the arrests of five alleged members and the seizure of a stash of weapons and equipment in the municipality. The Urabenos emerged from the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC). The AUC, a coalition of right-wing paramilitary groups that served as the state's proxy army for nearly a decade in its fight against guerrillas, demobilized in 2006, but many of its mid-level commanders and soldiers remained actively part of the criminal economy. Over time, they have diversified their criminal portfolios, with activities such as micro-trafficking, extortion and mining becoming increasingly important sources of revenue. 'Polvo Loco' and Mercury In Buritica, the men work under the auspices of the Urabenos in mines known locally as ""huecos"" (holes), which are gouged out of territory titled to Continental Gold. Conditions inside are cramped, airless and dangerous. ""It is inhuman,"" said Antonio Maria Hidalgo, who works in the Continental Gold mine and is a member of the local environmental roundtable. ""I don't know how these people psyche themselves up to work there every day."" The miners use illegal explosives known as ""polvo loco"" (crazy powder) to extract their product. Burns, loss of limbs, and fatalities are common, either from the powder exploding while the miners are using it or from the explosions that cause mines to cave in. Officially, there have been 12 deaths and over 40 injuries in 120 illegal mines over the last year, according to El Colombiano. However, locals say there have been many more. Some go unreported or are covered up by the mine ""owners"" to avoid unwanted attention. In other cases, no one knows who was in a mine when it collapsed. In addition to the polvo loco, the outsiders also brought another damaging technique associated with Colombia's illegal mining sector to Buritica: the use of mercury to extract gold. As well as seeping into the region's soils and waters, the highly toxic chemical is also released into the air as a gas when the gold is separated from the ore. The long term effects of mercury use -- damage to the central nervous system and the lungs, mental health issues, birth defects -- have yet to manifest themselves in Buritica, but the pollution from use of mercury and other mining-related contamination has already devastated the agricultural industry, the traditional mainstay of the local economy. One local farmer told InSight Crime how his crops now only grow to a stunted height before withering and dying. Others repeated this claim, although there has not, as of yet, been any scientific research done to determine the levels of mercury in the soil. Controlling Every Facet According to residents, the Urabenos control every facet of the illegal mining trade, charging each mine a monthly protection fee, the size of which varies according to the size of the mine, but also controlling the sale of mercury and explosives, the new businesses -- legal and illegal -- set up to cater for the miners, and the activities of the shadowy companies that purchase the gold off the miners -- the ""compras de oro"" (gold buyers). The compras de oro in particular are now a major source of concern to locals. Before the arrival of illegal mining, there were just a handful of compras de oro, which were well known to locals and sold the gold they purchased directly to the Banco de la Republica -- Colombia's central bank. Now, there are around a dozen such businesses located in the town and around the mines, and nobody knows who the owners are or where they sell their gold. ""It is still a mystery,"" said Diego Guzman, the Secretary for the Interior in the Buritica mayor's office. ""These places fund the gold mining; they buy the gold. But I don't know when they take it out of the town, or how they take it out, or whether they sell it in Medellin, Bogota, or wherever."" Although residents also say they cannot be sure who is behind the compras de oro, they are convinced the businesses are at the center of the illegal mining trade, and that the BACRIM are behind their spread. ""The word is, although it is not proven, that these are money laundering operations -- [drug traffickers] have a lot of cash and the compras de oro legalize it,"" said the community leader. If the locals' suspicions are correct, then this would fit a pattern seen throughout Antioquia and Colombia's other gold mining hotspots. It has long been common for criminal groups to purchase gold from illegal miners, often at prices higher than the official ones set by the bank, then sell it on to official outlets claiming it has been bought from legal mines that in reality are nothing but a facade. The influence of criminal groups in Buritica is now likely to expand further as Buritiquenos say more men come to seek their fortune in the area's illegal mines every day. In this, the town is not alone; mining -- both legal and illegal is currently proliferating rapidly across the country. The illegal mining sector now outstrips drug trafficking as the main source of criminal income for armed groups in eight of Colombia's 32 departments, according to a study published last year , and this is likely to expand, particularly as national criminal groups continue to fragment and local factions turn to local sources of income. In this new gold rush, the situation in Buritica may well represent the future for many other towns and villages around Antioquia and other mining hotspots. For the Buritiquenos though, it is hard to even imagine a future. Many residents are refugees from past fighting between the AUC and the guerrillas. ""All we can do about these things we see is leave or stay quiet and endure, each time a little bit more,"" said Amparo Jimenez, a member of the environmental roundtable. ""Maybe we Buritiquenos will be forced to be displaced,"" she said. ""We were displaced once before, and now we could be for the second time, because this is hitting us hard."" 'Dark Forces' Accompany New Arrivals The flood of illegal miners has also created a raft of social problems. Local drug trafficking and prostitution networks have sprung up in and around the mines. New bars line the roads near the mines and issues associated with heavy drinking, such as casual violence and traffic accidents, are now rife. ""They work, and they sell the gold. Right there by the mines are the bars, strip shows, restaurants,"" said Hidalgo. ""It is a rough life. They work to drink. They don't think about improving their quality of life."" The rapid population increase has also placed a huge strain on public services and led to severe overcrowding. There is now more trash than the municipal garbage trucks can haul away, water has to be rationed in dry periods, and schools and hospitals are overflowing. Many of the miners live in hastily-erected shacks consisting of little more than poles and plastic sheets, which now cover the mountainsides and the road leading out of town. Others have secured accommodation in the town, often by offering to pay a cash advance then moving in as many as 30 people into a single house. After the advance expires, the rent money on the properties often dries up, but the house owners are too intimidated to evict the reputedly violent tenants. ""People are scared of them because you never know who you are getting mixed up with,"" said Hidalgo. ""There are dark forces that came with them."""	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"US Surveillance Tracks Central America Gangs. Surveillance carried out by US authorities shows the MS-13 and Barrio 18 street gangs in Central America are in constant contact with their US counterparts, supporting claims that the maras have evolved into genuine transnational organized crime groups. Telephone wiretaps monitoring gang communications show how the leadership of the ""mara"" street gangs coordinate criminal activities between Honduras, El Salvador, and the United States, reported Honduran newspaper La Prensa. Investigations by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) also showed how money was channeled to the gang leadership via ""hormiga"" (ant) smuggling -- a method of smuggling that involves multiple small transfers of cash, often no more than $100 at one time. In the United States, the gangs have established a presence in Washington DC, Virginia, and California -- in particular Los Angeles. In October 2012, the US Treasury Department designated the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang as a transnational criminal organization (TCO). In June 2013, this was followed by the addition of six MS-13 leaders to the Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals. These moves on the part of US authorities proved controversial: even El Salvador President Mauricio Funes weighed in, accusing the US of ""over-estimating the gangs."" Reports of the ICE's tracking of the gangs' transnational communications and money transfers lend credence to the contentious designations by the Treasury Department. US authorities have previously observed that some gang leaders based in Central America have communicated regularly with gangs cells in the US. There has been one documented case in which an MS-13 leader contacted fellow gang ""clique"" members in Maryland in order to coordinate assassinations and collect debt payments, as InSight Crime has previously reported. The gangs certainly operate transnationally to an extent -- they are able to use their networks across all the countries where they operate to carry out cross-border crimes. However, they fundamentally remain a loose-knit network, more akin to criminal franchises than a genuine mafia structure, such as Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, and claims that rank them alongside such organizations should be treated with caution."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"NewsBrief: Mexicos Guns Smuggled From Central America, Says WikiLeaks. According to a U.S. State Department cable released by whistleblower site, WikiLeaks, via La Jornada , the most lethal weapons used by the Mexican cartels come from Central American arsenals, not from the U.S. La Jornada cites one cable, reference ID 09MEXICO808, reportedly drafted as a briefing for agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), following an arms trafficking conference that took place April 1 and 2 in Cuernavaca, Morelos. La Jornada reports that the cable states that 90 percent of the high-power weapons, submitted by Mexico law enforcement to the U.S. for tracing, were in fact traced to Central America arsenals. Another State Department cable , released by WikiLeaks and dated January 25, 2010, also discusses the problem of arms trafficking across the southern border. ""While there are 30,000 U.S. CBP officers on the 1,926 mile Mexican/U.S. border, only 125 Mexican immigration officials monitor the 577 border with Guatemala,"" the cable notes. Federal police in Mexico reportedly ""rescued"" 89 migrants being smuggled in a truck across the southern state of Veracruz, says El Universal. Four people were arrested at the scene. According to the UNDOC, the trafficking of Latin Americans to the U.S. via the Mexico border earns profits of $6.6 billion a year. Police also reported dismantling another trafficking ring in Tabasco, reports Proceso. El Espectador reports that former High Peace Commissioner, Luis Carlos Restrepo, is due to testify before the Prosecutor General about whether a rebel front, which allegedly demobilized from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ) in March 2006, was actually faked. Two demobilized guerrillas have declared that the demobilization was staged, in order to earn benefits from Colombia's Justice and Peace law, which gives certain immunity to rebel commanders who opt out of the conflict.

"Crackdown on Illegal Mining Wont End Ecuadors Gold Rush. Thousands of police and military have swept through the north Ecuador district of Buenos Aires in an attempt to control the illegal mining boom that has ravaged the region, but it may be too late to stop the country's criminal gold rush. On July 2, 2,400 soldiers and police officers were deployed to Buenos Aires and tasked with driving out illegal gold miners, who by some estimates numbered as many as 10,000. Over 2,700 miners voluntarily left the site, while a further 2,500 were driven away by security forces, reported El Universo. Among them were 1,395 Venezuelans and 906 Colombians, as well as several Dominicans, Argentines and a Haitian, reported El Telegrafo. In the first days of the operation, police also made 26 arrests and seized over 700 grams of gold, 1,400 sacks of ore and two firearms, according to El Universo. The authorities were finally provoked into taking drastic measures after a dramatic shootout between armed gangs left at least four wounded and two dead in late June, according to police officials. Shortly after the confrontation, President Lenin Moreno declared a state of emergency and launched the operation. Tensions have been building in the region since the arrival of heavily armed Colombian criminals in early 2019. While the identities of the Colombians are unconfirmed, a local miner, who did not want to be identified for fear of repercussions, claimed they were linked to organized crime structures in the Colombian city of Cali. Police officials, meanwhile, showed InSight Crime text communications from one suspect talking about how they were going to ""enter with the paracos "" -- Colombian slang for paramilitaries and a term commonly used for the criminalized successor groups of Colombia's demobilized counterinsurgents. The chat history includes photos of a small arsenal of high-powered weaponry. Sources in the area report how the Colombians drove out the Ecuadorean gangs that had previously controlled extortion networks. ""The Colombians arrived here with rifles, so [the Ecuadoreans] ran away,"" said the miner. According to the miner, the Colombians called meetings in which they laid down the new rules for working and living in the area, which included daily fees for every person to enter the mining zone, fees to open a mine, fees to run a processing plant and a 10 percent cut of all mining operations. With members of at least two different groups moving in on Buenos Aires, the miner, speaking in May 2019, predicted the violence to come. ""They will be friends until they have the zone under control, but when one starts earning more than the other, they are going to kill each other,"" he said. The operation has left Buenos Aires facing uncertainty over what will come next. The state of emergency will last for 60 days, and the government has yet to announce plans to keep control of the area in the long term. And while police operations continue, as of yet there is no sign the authorities have arrested gang leaders. The uncertainty has also spread to neighboring areas. Community leaders in the nearby region of Intag, which have been involved in a long-running struggle against plans for large-scale mining projects in the region, report they now fear illegal miners as well. Illegal mining operations have already been established in the Intag areas of Selva Alegre and Cuellaje. Community leaders that have opposed their arrival have received death threats, including one local council leader who was sent a video by WhatsApp purporting to show murders committed in Buenos Aires as a warning. Leaders warn that the operation in Buenos Aires could see displaced miners heading to Intag. ""Since the eviction of the miners in Buenos Aires, they are again arriving to Intag, and the situation is getting more dangerous,"" said Jose Cueva, a leader with the Intag environmental collective Corporacion Toisan. The massive deployment of security forces in north Ecuador may spell the end of the Buenos Aires boom, but it is unlikely to be the end of illegal mining in the region. The incredible riches on offer are likely to see miners return when the current unsustainable levels of security forces are reduced, even if the miners have to operate in a more clandestine fashion than before. The likelihood of miners returning is also boosted by the rampant corruption that facilitated the arrival of illegal mining to the region in the first place. Multiple sources alleged to InSight Crime that police and local authorities up to the highest levels were making huge profits from the Buenos Aires mines. As the situation in Intag shows, illegal mining is also poised to spread elsewhere, and not only in the immediate area. InSight Crime field research revealed a rapid growth in illegal mining operations throughout Ecuador's northern border region, while officials voiced concerns that there are as yet untouched areas that could prove as rich in gold as Buenos Aires. This new illegal mining boom in Ecuador coincides with a government drive to promote large-scale mining. Both legal and illegal mining now look set to expand side by side. The exploratory work of mining companies allows illegal miners to identify target sites, and in the case of Intag, leaders suspect that locals that work for the mining company are passing information on to the illegal miners. ""In Intag we have seen people connected to the company later turn up also helping the illegals,"" said Cueva. Communities struggling to keep their territories free of mining of any sorts also fear the presence of illegal operations will also be used to justify the expansion of large-scale mining, which the government can then present as a far more preferable alternative. These fears were stoked by recent comments made by the minister for energy, natural, non-renewable resources, Carlos Perez Garcia. ""There is going to be mining in this country one way or another,"" he told the media in April. ""Our decision is that there will be responsible mining and not illegal mining, which is effectively what damages the country."" However, the national government may find that decision ultimately lies outside of their control. Top Image: AP Photo Ecuador Featured Gold Illegal Mining "	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Mexico Arrests Alleged US Member of Tijuana Cartel. Mexican police have captured a U.S.-born suspected drug trafficking operative, who is allegedly one of the leaders of the Tijuana Cartel. Armando Villareal Heredia, alias ""El Gordo,"" was captured in Sonora state in north-western Mexico, according to the Federal Secretary of Public Safety. A statement from the government body confirmed that Villareal, a native of San Diego, California, faces charges of smuggling drugs from the state of Sinaloa in west Mexico to the United States. It is claimed that Heredia was responsible for coordinating the trafficking of drug shipments from Sinaloa to Baja California, and from there into the U.S. He is also allegedly responsible for stealing drug shipments from other criminal organizations in Jalisco state. Villareal is the subject of an arrest warrant in the United States, where he is wanted for conspiracy to murder, kidnapping and other crimes. He had been named in the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA's) most-wanted list for the San Diego region. The once-powerful Tijuana Cartel, also known as the Arellano Felix Organization, has been severely weakened in recent years by a brutal internal war as well as by the capture or death of many of its top leaders.

"Governments Must Go After the Money to Combat Transnational Crime: Report. A new report estimates that transnational crime in the developing world may be a multi-trillion dollar annual business, generating huge illicit financial flows that should be investigated and disrupted as part of the global fight against organized crime. The report from Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a Washington DC-based advocacy organization, estimated that transnational criminal activities generate between $1.6 and $2.2 trillion annually. Counterfeiting was the most profitable crime in the developing world, the report found, estimating the annual value of the business between $923 billion and $1.13 trillion. China and India are the major global players in the trade, but counterfeit cash , drugs , and other goods are also commonly produced and consumed in Latin America. Annual revenues from drug trafficking, estimated at between $426 and $652 billion, were the second highest of the 11 illegal activities examined in the report. Virtually all of the world's cocaine is produced in Latin America, as is a large proportion of other commonly-used drugs like marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine. Illegal logging, human trafficking and illegal mining were also among the highest-valued crimes examined in the report. According to the report, drug trafficking, illegal logging and illegal mining had a more specific impact on Latin America than the other crimes that were researched. While Latin America has long been a stronghold for drug trafficking organizations, criminal groups have begun to diversify and expand their operations into illegal logging and mining. Illegal logging is the most profitable natural resource crime, the report found, and is worth an estimated $52 to $157 billion annually. And South America's Amazon basin is at the heart of the industry. In particular, the value chain for Peruvian mahogany highlights the disparity in the revenues the industry generates. Loggers, who are often members of indigenous communities, earn about $70 per cubic meter of Peruvian mahogany. However, as the wood travels through the supply chain, illegal importers and exporters are the ones reaping the benefits. The report found that exporters of Peruvian mahogany earn $1,804 per cubic feet, a 2,477 percent increase in revenue compared to those who log the wood. Moreover, the report found that importers earned $3,170 per cubic meter, a staggering 5,200 percent increase. Oftentimes this illicit industry is tied to drug trafficking organizations in drug-producing countries like Colombia. In order to clear land for coca cultivation and landing strips used to traffic illicit drugs, thousands of hectares of forest have been logged in recent years. Illegal mining began to surge in Latin America around 2002, and consequently, the GFI report found, this activity has severely impacted Latin America in the intervening years. Based on a study from the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime that focused on nine specific Latin American countries, the GFI report's authors valued illegal gold mining at $7 billion each year. Colombia, Peru and Venezuela had the largest amount of illegal gold mining as it relates to total value, the report found. In particular, Colombia's illegal gold mining industry is estimated to be worth $2 billion annually, accounting for 80 percent of total gold mining. Only Venezuela held a greater share of illegal gold mining as a percentage of the total (between 86 and 91 percent), but annual revenues from the trade in that country reached only $700 million. The report's primary authors, GFI policy analyst Channing May and program manager Christine Clough, told InSight Crime that transnational crime must be treated as a ""business"" that is ""profit motivated."" In order to effectively combat transnational organized crime, they said, governments should place greater emphasis on the illicit financial flows generated by criminal activities. ""These are businesses, and you can't try to use techniques that have been used. They don't work,"" May said. ""We have to go after the money. Any business, regardless of goods or services, they have to have money in order to function."" Clough echoed these statements, adding that too often the discussion about curtailing transnational crime centers on money as it relates to lining the pockets of the criminals involved. What is often overlooked, Clough suggests, is the need for organized crime groups to reinvest their money to allow their illicit activities to continue. For that to happen, the profits of organized crime groups must often pass through legitimate financial institutions. Organized crime groups often use so-called ""shell companies"" to launder money through banking systems without detection. They have also made use of trade-based money laundering schemes that seek to hide illicit financial flows by making them appear as legitimate business transactions. Clough and May stressed that financial transparency could combat these crimes. Specifically, they argue for mandatory disclosure of beneficial ownership information for corporations -- that is, forcing coporations to reveal the living person or persons who ultimately benefit from the corporation's existence. ""We must know who is behind these accounts, who benefits from them and who controls them,"" Clough told InSight Crime. ""Just look at the Panama Papers. We know what is happening and we know who is behind it. Oftentimes it's illicit actors using a web of corporate structures around the globe to launder and move money in order to conduct business."" The report describes disclosure of beneficial ownership information as the "" most important ?nancial transparency tool for combatting transnational crime ."" But the authors also recommend increasing scrutiny of transactions involving entities located in so-called ""secrecy jurisdictions"" whose laws make it difficult to determine the beneficial owners of a given corporation. In addition, the report recommends greater scrutiny of global trade flows in order to detect discrepancies that could be the result of trade-based money laundering. More broadly, GFI says that implementing its recommendations will require greater cooperation both within and across governments. The ""fundamental goal"" of the authors' recommendations ""is to increase the availability of information on the money ?ows underpinning transnational crime in order to combat it,"" the report states. ""Sharing that information within and across governments will amplify its impact by allowing connections to be made more easily between traditionally separate oversight and enforcement areas.

European Crewed Drug Boat Captured by Spain. Spanish security forces have intercepted a boat crewed by Europeans carrying drugs from the Caribbean to Spain, in another sign that European criminal organizations are moving up the cocaine trafficking value chain. Police intercepted the boat close to the Azorean Islands, seizing approximately 800 kilos of cocaine and arresting four people: two Estonians, one Serb and a Spaniard (see video of the raid here ). Following the interception, 11 more people were arrested in the south of Spain in connection with the operation. The operation to dismantle the trafficking began several years before, reported El Universal. Authorities tracked three suspects and the boat from the Spanish island of Tenerife to Grenada in the Caribbean. From Grenada the suspects made various trips to Venezuela, apparently to negotiate the drug purchase. The captured traffickers were following a well beaten path for drug shipments -- the Iberian Peninsula is and has been for some years the main portal for drugs entering Europe and the Spanish islands are used as convenient unloading points. However, it is significant that the transporters were themselves European. In recent years there have been increasing signs that European organized crime groups are no longer content to receive shipments in Europe from Latin American counterparts, and are now establishing their own networks closer to the source. Eastern European groups have been at the forefront of this criminal migration. In addition to the Eastern Europeans arrested in connection with the latest seizures, there have been the cases of a trafficking ring with ties to Poland, Ukraine, and Lithuania dismantled in Ecuador , and the Serbian/Croatian network headed by Darco Saric , which moved cocaine from Argentina to Europe. This is supported by the last drug trafficking report of European police agency Europol, which noted both the increase in use of Europeans to transport cocaine and the increasing presence of European organized crime groups in Latin America, particularly Eastern Europeans and Italian mafia groups .	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Report Reveals Extent of Human Trafficking in Colombia. An estimated 70,000 people fall victim to human trafficking in Colombia every year, according to a new report that explores the country's internal and international human trafficking problem, and the regions where its effects are most profound. According to the report ""Trafficking and exploitation in Colombia: can't see it, can't talk about it,"" published by the non-governmental organization Women's Link Worldwide , the total figure of human trafficking victims was reached by studying previous reports, consulting groups in Colombia working in the field, and through field work in two key regions in the west of the country: Valle de Cauca and the coffee region. The study identified Valle de Cauca, Risaralda (part of the coffee region) and Antioquia as three key states from which victims originate, as well as the regions to which internal trafficking victims most commonly end (see map below). The report highlights the most common types of violations, including sexual exploitation, forced employment and slavery (often referred to as ""modern-day slavery""), as well as exploring why people from certain regions are more likely to become victims, concluding that populations are vulnerable when exposed to economic hardship, armed conflict and displacement. In the case of the coffee region, the report highlights how tumbling coffee prices in the 1990s -- combined with displacement and status as a key drug trafficking corridor and conflict -- created fertile conditions for human trafficking. Colombia has a longstanding problem with human trafficking and the United Nations reported earlier this year that practice is growing. Colombia is traditionally a common point of origin for women trafficked for prostitution in overseas markets, particularly Asia, Europe and the Middle East. However, there are signs that dynamic is changing. A report earlier this year highlighted how Colombian women are increasingly being trafficked to destinations within Latin America. This trend was recently highlighted by a case last year of a sex trafficking ring that sent Colombian women to Guatemala , and a case of trafficking for labor exploitation earlier this year, when hundreds of Colombians were rescued in Argentina. While Colombia has strong laws to tackle human trafficking, a forum earlier this year led by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime criticized the lack of political will or economic support to enforce them -- a problem felt throughout the region. What's more, the law is unable to reach the many victims transported outside of the country."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Chiquitas Paramilitary Payoffs Detailed in Trove of Declassified Documents. Confidential internal memos from Chiquita Brands International reveal that the banana giant benefited from its payments to Colombian paramilitary and guerrilla groups, contradicting the company's 2007 plea agreement with U.S. prosecutors, which claimed that the company had never received ""any actual security services or actual security equipment in exchange for the payments."" Chiquita had characterized the payments as ""extortion."" These documents are among thousands that Chiquita turned over to the U.S. Justice Department as part of a sentencing deal in which the company admitted to years of illegal payments to the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC) - a State Department-designated foreign terrorist organization - and agreed to pay a $25 million fine. The Archive has obtained more than 5,500 pages of Chiquita's internal documents from the Justice Department under the Freedom of Information Act and is publishing the entire set online today. Key documents from the Chiquita Papers are included in the recently-published document collection, Colombia and the United States: Political Violence, Narcotics, and Human Rights, 1948-2010 , now available as part of the Digital National Security Archive from ProQuest. The documents provide evidence of mutually-beneficial ""transactions"" between Chiquita's Colombian subsidiaries and several illegal armed groups in Colombia and shed light on more than a decade of security-related payments to guerrillas, paramilitaries, Colombian security forces, and government-sponsored ""Convivir"" militia groups. The collection also details the company's efforts to conceal the so-called ""sensitive payments"" in the expense accounts of company managers and through other accounting tricks. The Justice Department investigation concluded that many of Chiquita's payments to the AUC (also referred to as ""Autodefensas"" in many of the documents) were made through legal Convivir organizations ostensibly overseen by the Colombian army. New evidence indicating that Chiquita benefited from the illicit payments may increase the company's exposure to lawsuits representing victims of Colombia's illegal armed groups. The collection is the result of an Archive collaboration with George Washington University Law School's International Human Rights and Public Justice Advocac. Clinics and has been used in support of a civil suit brought against Chiquita led by Earth Rights International on behalf of hundreds of Colombian victims of paramilitary violence. ""These extraordinary records are the most detailed account to date of the true cost of doing business in Colombia,"" said Michael Evans, director of the National Security Archive's Colombia documentation project. ""Chiquita's apparent quid pro quo with guerrillas and paramilitaries responsible for countless killings belies the company's 2007 plea deal with the Justice Department. What we still don't know is why U.S. prosecutors overlooked what appears to be clear evidence that Chiquita benefited from these transactions."" The company's effort to conceal indications that it benefited from the payments is evident in a pair of legal memos from January 1994. The first of these indicates that leftist guerrillas provided security at some of Chiquita's plantations. The general manager of Chiquita operations in Turbo told company attorneys that guerrillas were ""used to supply security personnel at the various farms."" A handwritten annotation on a subsequent draft of the document asks, ""Why is this relevant?"" and, ""Why is this being written?"" Throughout the document, lawyers have crossed out the word ""transactions"" - suggestive of a quid pro quo arrangement - and replaced it with the more neutral term ""payments."" Company accountants characterized the expenditures as ""guerrilla extortion payments"" but recorded them in the books as ""citizen security,"" according to these memos. (* See Note 1) Another document shows that Chiquita also paid right-wing paramilitary forces for security services - including intelligence on guerrilla operations - after the AUC wrested control of the region from guerrillas in the mid-1990s. The March 2000 memo, written by Chiquita Senior Counsel Robert Thomas and based on a convesation with managers from Chiquita's wholly-owned subsidiary, Banadex, indicate that Santa Marta-based paramilitaries formed a front company, Manglar Investments (Inversiones Manglar), to disguise ""the real purpose of providing security."" (** See Note 2) Ostensibly an agricultural export business, Inversiones Manglar actually produced ""info on guerrilla movements,"" according to the memo. Banadex officials told Thomas that ""all other banana companies are contributing in Santa Marta"" and that Chiquita ""should continue making the payments"" as they ""can't get the same level of support from the military."" The Chiquita Papers also highlight the role of the Colombian military in pressuring the company to finance the AUC through the Convivir groups and in facilitating the illegal payments. One indication of this is found in another document written by Thomas in September 2000 describing the 1997 meeting where notorious AUC leader Carlos Castano first suggested to Banadex managers that they support a newly-established Convivir called La Tagua del Darien. According to the memo, the Banadex officials said that they had ""no choice but to attend the meeting"" as ""refusing to meet would antagonize the Colombia military, local and state govenment officials, and Autodefensas."" (*** See Note 3) Among the officials most supportive of the Convivir groups during this time was Alvaro Uribe, then the governor of Antioquia, the hub of Chiquita's operations in Colombia. Thomas' September 2000 memo notes that, ""It was well-known at the time that senior officers of the Colombian military and the Governor of the Department of Antioquia were campaigning for the establishment of a Convivir organization in Uraba."" A 1995 memo indicates that both Uribe and another politician, Alfonso Nunez, received substantial donations from another of Chiquita's Colombian subsidiaries, the Sevilla Fruit Company (Compania Frutera de Sevilla). Uribe was president of Colombia from 2002-2010. Later that year, an August 1997 legal memo written on Chiquita letterhead says that the company was ""member[s] of an organization called CONVIVIR Puntepiedra, S.A.,"" which the author characterizes as ""a legal entity in which we participate with other banana exporting companies in the Turbo region."" The memo says that the ""sole function"" of the the Convivir was ""to provide information on guerrilla movements."" The company had been making sensitive security payments for years - first in the form of direct payoffs to military officers and guerrilla groups, then through local trade organizations and the Convivir militias. For 1991, some $15,000 worth of ""sensitive payments"" to various units of the Colombian military are listed alongside a more than $31,000 disbursement to ""Guerrilla."" A different version of the same document omits the names of the payment recipients but includes a handwritten annotation next to the ""Guerrilla"" entry that says, ""Extortion Payment."" Another annotation reads, "" Mainly not illegal payments - these are legal - pay gasoline, army, police, politicians - payment doesn't provide anything or benefits."" [Emphasis added.] Accounting records from 1997-1998 also point to the role of Colombian security forces in encouraging the company's illegal paramilitary payments. Beginning in the second quarter of 1997 and continuing through the second quarter of 1998, sensitive payment schedules for Banadex record large payments to Convivir as ""Donation to citizen reconaissance group made at request of Army."" Similar records from 2002 and 2003 list Convivir payments alongside disbursements to ""Military and Police Officials"" for ""Facilitating payments for security services."" Another handwritten document from 1999 reveals an apparent effort by a Colombian Army general to establish himself as an intermediary for the paramilitary payments. The document (transcribed here ) describes a ""General in the zone for several years"" who had been accused of being ""with [a] death squad"" by the mayor of San Jose de Apartado and had been ""suspended from the Army."" The document notes that the general had ""helped us personally"" with ""Security"" and ""information that prevented kidnaps."" The notes make oblique reference to a $9,000 payment, adding that ""Other companies are putting in their"" ""The Chiquita Papers reinforce the idea that, by 1997, the AUC ran the show in the banana-growing regions of northern Colombia, and that local government officials, military officers, and business leaders supported their paramilitary operations,"" said Evans. ""These troublesome revelations are more than academic,"" said Professor Arturo Carrillo, Director of GW's International Human Rights Clinic. ""They reinforce the claim, advanced in half a dozen federal lawsuits currently pending against Chiquita, that the company was knowingly complicit in, and thus liable for, the atrocities committed by the AUC in Uraba while on the Chiquita payroll. One can only hope that the revealing information obtained and published by the National Security Archive will lead to greater accountability for Chiquita's criminal actions in Colombia, since the company's plea agreement with the Justice Department, which has refused to prosecute Chiquita executives for wrongdoing, amounts to little more than a slap on the corporate wrist."" ""The publication of these documents is just the beginning,"" added Evans. ""The thousands of pages of financial and legal records included in this collection are the seeds of future research projects for investigators prepared to deconstruct the complex web of legal, psuedo-legal, and illegal entities involved in Chiquita's security operations, including military officers, guerrillas, paramilitary thugs, prominent businessmen, trade associations, and Convivir militias."" (Reprinted with permission from Verdad Abierta and the National Security Archive .) Notes Note 1: A 1997 legal memo drawn up by Chiquita's U.S. counsel specifically warned that an extortion defense would not apply in situations where the company actually benefited from the payments. Another legal memo from the company's attorneys in Colombia cautioned that payments to ostensibly legal Convivir militias could be considered illegal if there were actual or constructive knowledge that they were connected to illegal activities. Note 2: Although Thomas' name does not appear in any of these records, his authorship has been confirmend by comparing the documents to the report of the Special Litigation Committee (SLC) established by Chiquita's Board of Directors that issued its final report in 2009. Note 3: Although the identity of the paramilitary leader who first approached the Banadex officials is not revealed in the redacted document, both the SLC report and the sentencing agreement confirm that it was Castano who was at the meeting and who personally requested that the company support the La Tagua group. * Michael Evans is the director of the National Security Archive's Colombia documentation project.

"Police Accused of Disappearing 5 Youths in Veracruz, Mexico. Another group of youths in Mexico have gone missing, leading to the arrest of a police chief and six other officers, which may reawaken the controversy around local police corruption in Mexico and the government's subsequent response. One teenage girl and four young men were abducted on January 11 after being detained by police at a gas station in Tierra Blanca, Veracruz. According to Luis Angel Bravo Contreras, the attorney general of Veracruz state, the officers handed the youths over to an unnamed criminal organization, the Latin American Herald Tribune reported. The youths were reportedly driving back from a beach vacation and were stopped for speeding. As of January 18, the federal attorney general's office, known by its Spanish acronym the PGR, assumed control of the investigation into the disappearance. ""We don't trust the authorities in Veracruz at all,"" one of the fathers of the missing youths told Animal Politico. Some 140 state and federal officers are still searching for the missing youths. A vehicle matching the one driven by the disappeared was found in a neighboring town a few days after the disappearance and will be subjected to forensic testing, reported teleSur. The quick intervention of both state and federal authorities in the latest disappearance suggests that President Enrique Pena Nieto's administration does not want the international embarrassment and blowback that followed the disappearance of 43 students in Iguala, Guerrero in September 2014, in a disturbingly similar situation. In that case, the government fumbled the investigation. Their conclusions - maintaining that local police in Iguala kidnapped the students and then handed them over to the criminal organization Guerreros Unidos -- was sharply criticized in a 560-page report by a panel of judicial experts appointed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Like Guerrero, Veracruz is plagued by violence connected to criminal gangs, the strongest of which are the Zetas. The prospect of state police collaborating with criminal gangs -- as suggested by the investigation thus far -- would not be an implausible scenario in Veracruz. However, it remains to be seen whether the PGR and the Veracruz state attorney general can put together a stronger case than happened with Iguala."	0	1	0	0	1	0	0
"Rumors Fuel The Legend of the ""Narco-Saint"". The reported arrest of a financial operator for ""The Craziest One,"" the former leader of Mexico's Familia Michoacana, has fueled rumors that the cartel boss, hailed by followers as a saint, is still alive. A recently detained man has been identified as the financial operator of Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, alias ""El Mas Loco,"" or ""El Chayo,"" reported BBC Mundo. The arrest feeds beliefs among Michoacan residents that the drug lord is still alive and has been directing operations ever since his ""death"" in December 2010. Nazario Moreno was said to have died in a firefight with national police, but his body was never recovered. Nazario Moreno, supposedly a devout, evangelical Christian, was one of the founders of La Familia Michoacana, a drug trafficking organization rooted in the state of same name where today a splinter group, the Knights Templar, holds sway. Journalist Jose Gil Olmos said the influence Nazario Moreno still has among the local populace is extremely important: ""They note his leadership, all the people of Michoacan say he did not die in this conflict Nazario is not only the physical leader of the Templars but the spiritual guide as well."" Some locals have even canonized him as a saint. In the community of Holanda in southern Michoacan a chapel has been built venerating Nazario Moreno's image, with writing above one column declaring, ""They are lying, Nazario is alive."" The leader, dead or alive, has become ""one of the central elements in the war against drug trafficking"" in Michoacan, said BBC Mundo. The Mexican government has never been able to confirm his death, reported BBC Mundo. Rumors of Nazario Moreno Gonzalez being alive , and alleged sightings of him by locals, have circulated practically since the day he died. His death brought the birth of the Knights Templar, which has co-opted and incorporated his spiritual and religious rhetoric into the group's pseudo-philosophy, even filling a handbook for new members with abstract religious and moral requirements, echoing the quasi-spiritual teachings of Moreno himself. Adopting the mysticism surrounding Nazario Moreno has served as an important propaganda and recruiting tool for the Knights Templar. By perpetuating and encouraging this mythology, and the idea Moreno may still be alive, the Knights Templar hope to penetrate the social and popular consciousness and win support in the face of continued assaults against them from vigilante and state security forces ."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"US Ambassador: FARC Have Not Complied With Colombia Peace Deal. The US ambassador to Colombia publicly aired his country's main grievances with regard to Colombia's peace agreement with the FARC guerrilla group, adding to growing pressure from the United States over the historic deal. ""The FARC have not complied, in my opinion, with their obligations under the agreement,"" US Ambassador to Colombia Kevin Whitaker said during a recent interview with El Tiempo. Echoing earlier comments by other US officials , Whitaker argued that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) continue to encourage coca cultivation in certain areas of the country, and said that the demobilized rebel group should not be involved in government efforts to implement crop substitution programs for coca farmers. While he said the United States recognized Colombia's efforts to eradicate coca, the ambassador insisted that the Andean country do more. ""It's arithmetic: more coca, more cocaine; more cocaine, more security and public health issues in both countries,"" Whitaker said. In addition, the ambassador said that ""the FARC need to give information concerning drug trafficking for investigations to be opened,"" arguing that this process, stipulated in the peace accords, ""has not occurred."" Whitaker also tied the FARC's willingness to provide information on drug trafficking to the group's status as a US-designated terrorist organization. He said the US decision to take the FARC off the blacklist would be based only on concrete acts showing that the group complied with the peace agreement. Whitaker's comments are part of a pattern of the United States putting increasing pressure on Colombia with regard to the peace agreement, which US officials have blamed in large part for an increase in Colombian cocaine production in recent years. But this pressure so far has not helped to advance the peace process; rather, it has caused rifts in the crucial US-Colombia security relationship. The implementation of the peace agreement is a delicate process. Certain measures, such as the handing over of weapons by the FARC, were priorities for which the accords set a defined timeframe. Such is not the case with the FARC's obligation to divulge information concerning the cocaine trade. The FARC have not complied with this provision simply because the process has not yet reached the stage of building complicated judicial cases based on FARC revelations and cooperation with prosecutors. SEE ALSO : Coverage of FARC Peace As InSight Crime reported last year , the Colombian government has asked the United States to remove the FARC from the terrorism blacklist in order to build confidence in the peace process among the demoblized guerrillas. However, Whitaker's comments suggest that the United States will be reluctant to take such a step unless the Colombian government can make concessions on the drug issue, which has become a major sticking point from the perspective of US officials."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Investigation Highlights Miamis Role in Turning Dirty Gold Into Clean Cash. A new journalistic investigation reveals the inner workings of Miami's dirty gold trade, which has helped powerful Latin American crime groups whitewash their criminal profits. The multimedia investigation published by the Miami Herald on January 16, entitled ""Dirty Gold, Clean Cash,"" details two money laundering schemes in which transnational organized crime exploited Miami's role as a gold and jewelry hub to launder criminal proceeds. The first section of the multi-part report chronicles how the Miami-based NTR Metals company imported an astonishing $3.6 billion in illegal gold from criminal groups in Latin America between January 2013 and March 2017. The company's executives pleaded guilty in a sealed agreement in September 2017. NTR is a subsidiary and gold provider for the Dallas-based Elemetal company, among whose clients are Apple, Tiffany & Co., and dozens of Fortune 500 companies. The Miami-based subsidiary initially bought the illegal product from Peru. In 2013 alone, NTR acquired nearly $1 billion in gold from the Andean country, including some $400 million worth from Pedro Perez Miranda, alias ""Peter Ferrari,"" according to the Miami Herald. Peter Ferrari is one of the main actors linked to a massive Peruvian illegal gold case , which has ensnared NTR along with other foreign-based gold importing companies. On January 9, US authorities made public an indictment against Ferrari and three other Peruvian nationals, alleging an international gold money laundering scheme in which NTR's three previously-charged executives are named as co-conspirators. Following Peruvian authorities' crackdown on the illegal gold trade, NTR followed a known pattern of buying Peruvian gold smuggled to neighboring Bolivia and Ecuador. After the latter two countries upped their enforcement against illegal mining, NTR started to buy gold from Colombia, which is also home to large-scale illegal production. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Gold But behind this international trade are criminal groups that invest in illicit gold sites in order to launder their criminal proceeds through sales to companies such as NTR, the Miami Herald reported. Organized crime also exploited Miami's role as a gold hub to launder criminal proceeds from within the United States, as alleged in a case against more than 30 Chicago-based Sinaloa Cartel members. US authorities say Sinaloa Cartel operatives used drug proceeds to buy gold from jewelers and pawnshops, before sending the precious metal to a Fort Lauderdale-based company named Golden Opportunities. Just like NTR, Golden Opportunities would then send the gold to be melted in US refineries before selling it, and would falsify documents to allege that the gold had been acquired from Mexico. This allowed Golden Opportunities use its Mexico-based office to repay its alleged suppliers -- in reality Sinaloa Cartel-owned front companies -- thereby laundering more than $100 million in drug money. In addition to being physically and culturally close to Latin America, South Florida -- and Miami in particular -- maintains strong economic ties to the region. For this reason, the city has long been a center of activity for both legal and illicit businesses operating in the United States and its Latin American neighbors. Once the prime US landing spot for cocaine in the days of the Medellin and Cali cartels during the 1970s and 1980s, Miami still regularly makes headlines for its role in transnational organized crime schemes , from arms trafficking to Latin American countries , to smuggling of trafficked animals into the United States. The city's busy air and maritime ports often play a central role in these schemes. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Money Laundering Moreover, Miami's reputation for extravagance and luxury has made it an attractive money laundering locale. The city's renown jewelery district provides many opportunties for running schemes like the ones described by the Miami Herald, and its high-priced real estate market offers another method for cleaning dirty cash. ""We are surely the global hub for money laundering,"" said Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle in April 2016 , following the arrest of an alleged money laundering network linked to the Sinaloa Cartel."	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
Satellite Images Show Threat of Criminal Activities in Perus Amazon. Satellite mapping of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon shows how criminal activities threaten the world's largest rainforest. Imaging compiled by the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP) shows how in 2018 medium scale deforestation affected huge swaths of rainforest in Peru's central and southern jungle regions. It also highlights five deforestation hotspots in 2018, with the southeast of the country the worst affected. Three of the five, La Pampa, the area around Bahuaja Sonene National Park and Iberia are in the Madre de Dios region. In these areas, deforestation is driven by illegal gold mining, and agricultural projects, including some plantations in restricted areas where agriculture is not permitted. The other areas are spread between the central jungle regions of Ucayali and Huanaco and the northeastern forests of Loreto, where agriculture has claimed large jungle areas, many of which lie within forestry zoning areas where it is not permitted. Over 155,000 hectares of Peruvian forests were cut down in 2017, according to figures of the National Forestry and Wildlife Service (Servicio Nacional Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre - SERFOR. While some of this was a result of legal activities, much of it was a result of multimillion-dollar criminal economies that feed off the Amazon. As the MAAP images highlight, one of the main causes of deforestation is rampant illegal gold mining in the Madre de Dios region. Run by criminal mining clans and a driver of other organized crime activities such as human trafficking and money laundering , illegal mining not only causes deforestation but also widespread contamination of the Amazon, through the use of chemicals such as mercury and the dumping of waste material. Peru is also home to a lucrative illegal timber trade. Illegal loggers operating in regions such as Loreto, Ucuyali, Madre de Dios, San Martin and Huanaco, are driving certain species to the edge of extinction in order to supply the domestic market and international markets such as China. Behind the loggers are mafias of timber traffickers, many of which operate behind the front of legal companies, and corruption networks reaching deep into the state. The drug trade is also a major driver of deforestation , as the isolation of the jungle provides the perfect cover for coca cultivation as well as for the clandestine landing strips used by the light aircraft that traffic drugs out of the country. Drug processing also contaminates the environment by dumping the toxic precursor chemicals used into the Amazonian waterways. Even ostensibly legal activities are often fronts for criminality and corruption in the Amazon. As shown by MAAP, agricultural projects often pay little heed to land use and deforestation restrictions as land grabs are easy to legalize thanks to rampant corruption. Land trafficking is also rife , with plots illegally traded and then razed for agriculture.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Govt Promises to Protect Juarez Doctors After Strike. After a 24-hour strike by doctors in Ciudad Juarez, the government has promised more security for health care professionals in that embattled city. The governor of the state of Chihuahua, Cesar Duarte Jaquez, designated hospitals in Ciudad Juarez ""high-risk zones,"" and, according to the Juarez daily El Diario , the governor will create a permanent coordinating body of Municipal Police, Army, and Federal Police to provide special security for doctors and nurses in the city. Triggered by the murder of one of their colleagues and a rise in kidnappings of doctors, medical professionals went on a 24-hour strike on Monday to bring attention to the hostile and violent climate in the city. If their demands for increased security were not met by the state government, they threatened to extend the protest. Eleven doctors were kidnapped this year, and two of them killed. According to CNN Mexico , the year saw a record number of people killed in Juarez, as 3,000 died in drug-related deaths, a ten-fold increase since 2006. "	0	0	1	1	1	0	0
"El Salvador Gangs Influence Local Politics in the Capital: Report. Electoral pacts between politicians of all stripes and gangs in El Salvador are no longer surprising, but a new investigation has revealed the extent of these dealings during the administration of former San Salvador Mayor Nayib Bukele, who now seeks to run for president. According to a report published by El Faro , Bukele, who was mayor of San Salvador between 2015 and 2018 for the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional - FMLN), negotiated with gangs and awarded concessions that included giving the Barrio 18 the power to decide the allocation of some vending permissions in the Cuscatlan market, one of the first flagship projects of the young politician's administration. The investigation also indicates that when he ran for mayor of the capital city, Bukele opted for a formula that had already been used by representatives of the FMLN and the main opposition party, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (Alianza Republicana Nacionalista - ARENA), to secure agreements with the MS13 and Barrio 18 that included promises of giving benefits in exchange for the gangs providing security and giving access to territories under their control for campaign activities. In the case of the FMLN, the negotiation prior to the 2014 presidential election included offers from the ruling party to invest millions of dollars to benefit gang members and their families with social programs. In August 2017, gang member Carlos Eduardo Burgo Nuila, aka ""Nalo,"" revealed in court that the pacts included the political parties giving cash to the MS13 and the two factions of the Barrio 18. According to El Faro's investigation, the Bukele campaign also gave money to the gangs. What is different in the case of former mayor Bukele, according to El Faro, is that his administration understood that the territorial control the gangs exercised over groups that are key to the governance of the city, like street vendors, was inescapable. And the Bukele administration chose to strike agreements with leaders of the three gangs to ensure a fragile balance on the city's streets. These pacts were not merely pre-electoral deals, but visions for co-governance. ""It was a sum of daily deals that enabled the mayor to intervene in the main squares and plazas as well as having access to some of the communities where gang control is very strong,"" the report says. One of the clearest examples of such day-to-day dealings occurred on May 23, 2015, less than a month after Bukele was sworn in as mayor of San Salvador. That day the city celebrated the beatification of Oscar Arnulfo Romero, the Catholic bishop murdered in 1980 by a death squad. It was a massive event covered by dozens of international media organizations. The Bukele administration, according to El Faro, negotiated with the gangs regarding the distribution of space for street sales in the vicinity of the Americas Plaza, where the event was held, in order to prevent violent outbreaks. Bukele, like other politicians before him, seems to have a double standard when in it comes to politicians negotiating deals with gangs. When his political opponents did it, the former mayor questioned the pacts. But when his own dealings surfaced, his administration justified it by admitting that it is impossible for the capital's local government to work without negotiating with gang members. The negotiations attributed to Bukele's administration confirm that gangs are impossible actors to ignore in Salvadoran politics. Gangs in El Salvador are relevant actors at the time of winning an election or, as Bukele's case shows, while governing. This is a trend that has been consolidated after the failed 2012 truce between the administration of former President Mauricio Funes and the MS13 and Barrio 18. After the failure of that truce in 2014, the government of President Salvador Sanchez Ceren undertook a full-on assault against the gangs that caused a considerable increase in homicides (the murder rate in 2015 soared to above 100 per 100,000 citizens) and paved the way for extrajudicial executions of gang members by security forces. However, despite this heavy-handed approach, talks between politicians and gangs have continued. This is largely due to the fact that the state, at both the national and local levels, has been unable to regain the territorial control now exercised by the MS13 and the Barrio 18's two factions in large areas of the country, including the capital's historic center. On some occasions, these pacts have had a clearly criminal profile , as is the case of the former mayor of the town of Apopa , Jose Elias Hernandez from the ARENA party. According to El Salvador's Attorney General's Office, Hernandez allowed gangs to collect extortion payments and carry out executions. The public policies of the Sanchez Ceren administration have not been fully effective in terms of reducing violence either. While homicides have declined from their 2015 peak, figures from the first half of this year suggest that 2018 will close with an average of 10 murders per day, roughly on par with what was seen in prior years. All this has left local politicians in a gray area in which they are forced to condemn the gangs' actions publicly while they make pacts with them privately. It does not seem accidental, therefore, that the main contenders for El Salvador's presidency in 2019, including Bukele, continue to evade the issue of insecurity, crimes attributed to the gangs and the possibility of negotiating with them."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Town Anxious Ahead of Peace Plans Experiment in Coca Substitution. Verdad Abierta presents a close-up of the small mountain town Colombia has selected to pilot an internationally-supported coca crop substitution project that will be jointly managed by the government and guerrillas with the goal of bringing peace and undermining the country's premiere criminal economy. Overnight, the municipality of Briceno went from being a forgotten town nestled in the mountains of northern Antioquia to one of the main reference points for Colombia's post-conflict future. Its inhabitants now live between skepticism and optimism. When the plenipotentiary delegate of the FARC, Felix Antonio Munoz, alias ""Pastor Alape,"" and the minister for post conflict, Rafael Pardo, appeared on July 11 at the school of Pueblo Nuevo de Briceno, the public was elated. Protocol went by the wayside; those attending the event ignored instructions to be orderly and keep their distance from the dignitaries' table. A swarm of mobile phones, tablets and other digital devices snapped pictures and took videos. This article was translated, edited for clarity and published with the permission of VerdadAbierta.com. It does not necessarily represent the views of InSight Crime. See the Spanish original here. The occasion merited the excitement. It was the first time a senior government official had visited this remote corner of northern Antioquia department. Although many in Pueblo Nuevo had grown up under the influence of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), they had never seen a high-ranking guerrilla commander in person. The hamlet, which normally has a population of fewer than 400, swelled with people. Farmers trekked from other villages near and far to witness the event. The high level delegation's visit also attracted a bevy of national and local officials, domestic and foreign activists, and numerous reporters, photographers and cameramen. Local residents were not just drawn by the fanfare. They came to learn firsthand about the plans of the national government and the FARC to implement a pilot project here aimed at putting an end to coca cultivation. The project was of no small consequence to them as coca has been the exclusive source of livelihood for just over 5,000 farmers in the area for the past 15 years. ""We don't come to eradicate, we come to build a program in association with the communities,"" rebel commander Munoz told the crowd. Minister Pardo added: ""From this afternoon, we start work on building an alternative."" Pardo said the project would begin work in the next two months with about 2,000 families and 727 farming groups from the towns of Pueblo Nuevo, El Orejon, La Calera, La America, El Pescado, La Mina, Buena Vista, Altos de Chiri, Roblal and Palmichal. The proposal, said the minister, was for farmers to commit to eradicating and not replanting coca while the government implements immediate support measures and develops a strategy for alternative development. When Did ""Green Gold"" Begin to Flourish? Nobody knows for certain how the coca leaf came to cover the mountains of Briceno, but everyone agrees that the first seeds were sown in the early 2000s. Jose,* who has lived in Briceno for more than 20 years, recalled that it was about 2002 when one of his neighbors started to grow coca plants. A year later, residents of the town had abandoned cultivation of cassava, beans, and sugar cane in favor of the ""green gold."" ""The same thing happened in other hamlets"" added the farmer. In the blink of an eye, the illicit crops spread like a plague throughout the 32 hamlets of this area, as well as others. In Briceno they could grow coca without the constant threat of planes overhead spraying glyphosate herbicide or of trucks carrying squads of coca eradicators. During those early years of the new millennium, the municipality of Briceno was the scene of a battle of blood and fire between guerrillas and their paramilitary enemies. On one side was the 36th Front of the FARC, which had made northern Antioquia its impregnable fortress. On the other side, the Miners Block (Bloque Mineros) of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC), a war machine that imposed its own law on the towns where it operated. The armed conflict in Briceno ended up dividing the municipality's residents, with people in the towns working for the paramilitaries and those in the more rural areas at the service of the guerrillas. ""At that time you knew that in town you had to sell to the paramilitaries. But if you were in the countryside, you had to sell to the guerrillas,"" said a farmer named Carlos. ""Once you sold to one of them, you couldn't sell to anyone else."" The economic life of the municipality was transformed. Almost everything began to revolve around coca. The only gas station in the village began to have difficulty meeting increased demand, as gasoline is a vital ingredient for transforming the leaves to paste. Lowly mule drivers enjoyed a new level of respect as they became the most efficient means to transport barrels, materials, bundles of coca leaf and coca paste up and down the steep mountainsides. They were times when the area was flush with cash, recalls Carlos. ""I'm not exaggerating!"" he said. ""On the outskirts of town there was a house, where at the end of the month, a man arrived that brought stacks of money to pay for the coca paste. The farmers lined up, because there were many of them. The man weighed the paste, gave them the money, and threw the paste into another stack."" One way or another -- voluntarily or forced by circumstance -- many of Briceno's 8,000 inhabitants have lived off coca production for the last 15 years. ""In this town, at least 90 percent of the people live, directly or indirectly, from coca. I could say that in about 98 percent of the hamlets there is coca,"" said Briceno Mayor Jose Danilo Agudelo. Expectations of Investment Recent events in Briceno have stirred mixed feelings for many of the area's residents. ""Without noticing it, we became famous,"" Julio said as he anxiously awaited the arrival of the visiting dignitaries. ""First, nobody knew we existed, and now everyone is watching us."" A lot of attention has focused on Briceno since the FARC and the government announced in Havana that they would jointly implement a unique crop substitution initiative in rural communities, starting with this remote outpost. The initiative is part of the measures aimed at de-escalating the conflict and building trust. The town was chosen in part because it had hosted another pilot project involving both the government and the FARC since June 2015: humanitarian demining. As the demining project draws to a close and the coca substitution project prepares to get underway, many in Briceno remain highly skeptical. ""It is a question of what will happen when the coca is gone,"" said Judy Elena Posada, an officer of the women's association that has operated here for 15 years. ""Who will we sell our bread and our products to, if everything here is moved by coca?"" The women's association has 700 members in both rural areas and the towns and foments productive activities like bakeries and tailoring. Ignacio Jaramillo, president of the Briceno's community association, said ending the illegal economy was not enough: ""What will bring peace is if the farmers have real quality of life."" Community leader Fabio Munoz said the area's farmers needed more information about the peace agreement and its implications. ""All you have to do is look at the municipality's roads,"" Munoz said. ""If there is no road improvement, the crop substitution will be a failure. If there is no viable way to transport products from the fields, people will go back to the production of coca."" So What is the Plan? Despite the statements by both guerrilla and government representatives, residents of Briceno felt there was a lack of clarity. It was clear though, that both sides will work together with rural communities to design a path that responds to the needs of farmers now deriving their livelihood from the coca, and that doing so will remove the primary source of funding for Colombia's armed conflict. It was also clear that the pilot plan, which will get off the ground in a few months, will be a new experiment in the fight against illegal crops and will be backed by entities that inspire public confidence, including the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Nevertheless, it will be no easy task. Gabriel Sanchez of the Briceno Farmers Association said the biggest risk is that the government will fail to keep its promises. ""We will develop some proposals, and we hope that they will be heard and included in this path,"" Sanchez said, adding that ""the advance of paramilitary groups is also a concern."" Rather than immediate eradication, the project will start with the gradual substitution of coca crops, which is likely to draw criticism from some political sectors, according to Pedro Arenas, coordinator of the illicit crop observatory at Institute of Studies for Development and Peace ( Instituto de Estudios para el Desarrollo y la Paz - INDEPAZ). Arenas said the plan could work, noting international recognition that the causes of illicit cultivation must be addressed. ""In the United Nations it is now accepted that the indicators for a process of this kind can no longer be the number of plants that are destroyed, or the number of hectares cleared. No, the indicator is development: How much development has materialized in a community like Briceno that has helped to eliminate that which was illegal?"" *Some names have been changed at the request of the sources.

"Rumored Zetas Split Offers Bloody Prospects for Mexico. Reports of a split between the two leaders of Mexico's notorious Zetas drug gang suggest that a violent power struggle may be brewing in the group's northeastern home turf, a conflict which could shake the established order in the country's criminal underworld. According to a new report from Proceso , the partnership of the Zetas ' two main leaders -- Heriberto Lazcano, alias "" Z-3 "", and Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, alias "" Z-40 "" -- has come under strain, and the two appear to be headed for an open confrontation. In recent months, a series of public banners (known as ""mantas"") and videos uploaded to the internet have made reference to the two Zeta leaders' capacity for betrayal. One manta, which appeared both in Monterrey and Zacatecas on June 1, placed a photo of Lazcano amid several former Zeta leaders who have been killed or arrested over the past several years, implying that Lazcano arranged their downfalls so as to secure control of the group. However, the manta also alleges that Trevino was involved in the betrayals and asks, ""Are we better off with Lazca or Z-40?"", which suggests that the authors were either disgruntled lower-level Zetas or a rival group passing themselves off as such. A series of videos was posted online over the following days which referred to Trevino as the ""New Judas"" and accused him of using federal troops to have his fellow Zetas commanders picked off one by one. The Proceso report points to Trevino as the more powerful of the two leaders today, with Lazcano evidently spending much of his time in recent years in foreign countries, among them Germany and Costa Rica. But the tangle of accusations and apparent betrayals, which are far more numerous than those outlined above, suggests a breakdown in organizational structure that goes beyond the two principal leaders. As InSight Crime has noted in the past , this hypothesis is supported by the numerous incidents of disobedience in the ranks of the Zetas. Proceso describes the 49 dead bodies left in along a highway in Nuevo Leon in May as another example of this phenomenon. According to the magazine, the local boss charged with carrying out the crime disobeyed Trevino in not tossing the bodies in a nearby town plaza, because of his worries about the backlash of such a provocation. Instead, he dumped the bodies along a comparatively remote stretch of highway, where they were subsequently discovered by authorities. Trevino's relative strength doesn't assure that he'll emerge victorious or (even less likely) strengthened by the internal strife. Indeed, the reports of internal decay make it likely that whatever the result of the recent tensions, the victorious capo will be heading a weaker organization. Continuing degradation in the Zetas' command structure would likely be a source of violence in the group's territories in the northeast, especially Veracruz, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas. Certainly, internal strife within a group typically leads to a sharp uptick in murders. Such has been the case in Mexico's northeast for years: the 2010 conflict between erstwhile allies the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas has driven a sharp increase in murder rates in the state's named above. A similar dynamic was at play in 2008, when the Beltran Leyva Organization split from the Sinaloa Cartel, which drove an outbreak in violence across wide swaths of western and southern Mexico. Or, further back, the split between the Carrillo Fuentes family and the Sinaloa Cartel following the latter's murder of Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes in 2004 eventually precipitated the fight over Juarez that has turned the border town into Mexico's most violent city for the past four years. In such cases, the subsequent fighting may be initially motivated by revenge or personal hatreds, but the dispute for territorial control is often not far from the surface, and helps sustain the conflict for years to come. For instance, Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes' murder may have helped spark the tension that led to the fight for Juarez, but it was control of the border town itself, one of the busiest along the US-Mexico border, that turned a blood feud into something like a war zone. However, a prolonged spiral of violence isn't inevitable; the division between the Familia Michoacana and Caballeros Templarios, which followed the 2010 death of Familia boss Nazario Moreno, provoked a relatively mild increase in violence in Michoacan. Indeed, the state's murder rate in 2011 (a little more than 17) remained below the national average (just shy of 21), and the rate through six months of 2012 is virtually identical. A weakening of the Zetas in their home turf may also discourage the group's forays into far-flung regions of Mexico, such as Jalisco or Sinaloa. The organization's presence in such areas has led to a great deal of violence, and has helped cement the Zetas' reputation as the most expansionist, destabilizing gang in Mexico. Should fighting at home lead bosses to call their gunmen deployed elsewhere back into the state's northeastern home, this could lead to a lessening of tensions elsewhere. Furthermore, reports that a significant chunk of the Zetas could align with the Gulf Cartel could be a key factor in determining the impact of the split. If a resulting alliance is capable of overwhelming the divisions between the Gulf Cartel and Zetas bosses -- i.e., if the Zetas resisting collaboration with other groups are eliminated from the industry- then it could ultimately turn into a driver of a more peaceful interaction between the various gangs in Mexico's northeast. That's the most optimistic scenario, and while not implausible, unfortunately recent history suggests that it is not a particularly likely outcome. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Seizes Millions More in Assets Linked to Cachiros. Authorities in Honduras have reportedly seized millions of dollars worth of property linked to the Cachiros drug trafficking network, in the latest blow to the debilitated criminal structure. Law enforcement carried out nearly a dozen raids, seizing 131 properties and 11 businesses, the Honduran Attorney General's Office announced in a September 25 press release. According to La Tribuna , the total value of the seized assets surpassed 100 million lempiras ($4.2 million). In addition, the Attorney General's Office identified several individuals tied to suspicious business and real estate transactions with Marlene Isabel Cruz Quintanilla, the wife of Cachiros leader Javier Rivera Maradiaga, who is currently jailed in the United States. One of these figures was Jessica Maria Paz Castellanos, who reportedly grew close with Rivera Maradiaga and his wife after meeting them in 2012. La Prensa described Paz Castellanos as the ""brain"" of the Cachiros' finanacial operations. She is suspected of creating a number of front companies to help launder the group's drug earnings. The Attorney General's Office also said that investigations had uncovered suspicious transactions linked to businessman Juan Angel Maradiaga Lopez and current congressional representative Midence Oquely Martinez, who is running for re-election in the Cachiros' former stronghold of the department of Colon. The latest asset seizures represent only a drop in the bucket of the more than $800 million in property that Honduran authorities claim to have seized in recent years from the Cachiros, which became essentially defunct as a criminal organization after its leaders -- brothers Javier and Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga -- turned themselves over to US authorities in 2015. However, the confiscations are a sign that investigations into the Cachiros' network are continuing, and the naming of prominent business and political figures could be a sign that criminal charges could be brought against new suspects in the future. Indeed, testimony provided by Javier Rivera Maradiaga in connection with his pleading guilty to US drug charges has implicated a number of Honduran elites in colluding with the criminal organization he ran."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexican Set to Compensate Victims of Drug Violence. Mexico's Senate has approved a bill to compensate victims of organized crime, one of the major demands of the peace movement led by poet Javier Sicilia. The law would oblige the state to help and protect victims of violence and human rights abuses connected to organized crime, reports El Universal. Under the law, the state will provide compensation of up to 934,000 pesos ($70,000) to victims. The legislation would create a National System for Attention to Victims, which will provide support to those hurt by crime and oversee compensation payments. The body would include representatives of victims' groups and of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Poet and activist Javier Sicila was a major force campaigning to get the law passed. He became deeply involved with the peace movement after his son was killed, along with six friends, by a drug gang in 2011. The bill must now be approved by the House of Representatives before it becomes law. Leading lawmakers have committed to passing the bill by Monday at the latest. It is not clear how the Mexican state will judge who qualifies as a victim, as many crimes are never brought to trial. It could also prove extremely costly to provide compensation to all those who have been victimized, with at least 50,000 people estimated to have died in organized crime-related killings since 2006. There are high hopes for the law, with Senators Fernando Baeza and Tomas Torres saying that it ""lays the foundations to reconstruct the social fabric which has been so gravely affected by violence."" The drug violence in Mexico has not ended, though there are signs that killings have peaked -- it may be impossible to begin the healing process while violence continues. The law invites comparison to Colombia's Victims Law, passed last year, which sets out reparations for people hurt by the five-decade-old civil conflict. A key difference between the two is that Colombia's law is aimed at victims of the state, paramilitary groups, and guerrillas, all of whom are combatants in the conflict. In Mexico, on the other hand, there is no civil conflict between insurgent groups. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Spanish Network Allegedly Sent Millions to FARC Rebels. The trial has begun for 45 members of a drug money laundering network operating in Spain alleged to have provided funding for Colombia's FARC guerrillas, raising questions over the extent of the group's European links. If convicted, Ecuadorean national Jenny Alexandra Fasce Schumaker could face up to 18 years in prison for heading a network that sent cocaine proceeds back to illegal organizations in Colombia and Ecuador between 2007 and 2010, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Various alleged members of the network, including Fasce and her husband, Luis Berho Velasco, were arrested in 2010, reported Europa Press , and 52 members were indicted in February 2012. On the first day of the trial, Fasce admitted sending large quantities of money to Colombia and Ecuador, charging a 3 percent commission for each transaction, but said she did not know if the money had come from drug trafficking activities or whether it was sent to the FARC, reported EFE. It is thought she succeeded in sending $8 million to Latin America, said Europa Press. Authorities established a FARC link based on records of money orders Fasce sent to Colombia, among which they found the name of Juan Manuel Gomez Buitrago, a jailed FARC member accused of involvement in a 2006 massacre in the department of Huila, among other crimes. Authorities also found 12 others who received money thought to have been sent to the guerrilla group. There is evidence of the FARC's European ties. Information from the computer files of slain FARC leader Luis Edgar Devia Silva, alias ""Raul Reyes,"" indicated links between the FARC and Spain's Basque separatist group the Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA). The files also led to the arrest of a member of the FARC's international network in Spain, Maria Remedios Garcia, alias ""Irene."" In 2011, European police body Europol reported that intelligence found the FARC was among various Colombian groups involved in the European cocaine market -- but it's not thought it sells directly. It may be that it receives a cut of drug sales from business associates who do operate in Europe, such as Daniel ""El Loco"" Barrera , in addition to the money it makes selling such associates the coca base they need to make cocaine. Such a set-up might explain why the rebels might be receiving money such as that reportedly sent by Fasce, despite the fact they have no known established presence or trafficking routes in Europe."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Was Chiles Dictator Also a Drug Trafficker?A Chilean newspaper has suggested nearly 3,000 classified US documents contain information linking former dictator Augusto Pinochet to drug trafficking, a somewhat questionable claim given the legacy of his iron rule. Chilean news outlet El Ciudadano reports it solicited 2,984 pages of documents in 2015 from the US Department of Justice under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Of these documents, which are part of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) archives, only one was declassified and released. According to El Ciudadano, US authorities cited several reasons for keeping the files classified, including their potential to jeopardize ongoing cases, affect the privacy of third parties, and identify sources of intelligence for government agencies. Nonetheless, El Ciudadano implies the censored DEA files contain information pertaining to Pinochet's involvement in the drug trade. A key piece of evidence linking Pinochet and drug trafficking are statements made in 2006 by Manuel Contreras, the former head of Chile's National Directorate of Intelligence (Direccion de Inteligencia Nacional - DINA), the secret police during Pinochet's dictatorship. That year, Contreras alleged the Pinochet family became rich from drug trafficking. Contreras also claimed Pinochet sent his son to work with head DINA chemist Eugenio Berrios to learn how to make ""black cocaine,"" which is supposedly undetectable by drug dogs. Additionally, El Ciudadano cites testimony from a former Central Intelligence Agency employee, Ivan Baramdyka, who said that during Pinochet's dictatorship Chile sold precursor chemicals to drug cartels and exported cocaine to Europe and the United States. El Ciudadano plans to appeal the denial of the FOIA request. Pinochet's hold on power from 1973 to 1990 was one of the single longest dictatorships in the Americas. During his reign , reprehensible acts of government repression and human rights violations occurred, with thousands tortured, killed, or disappeared. Nonetheless, the DEA's withholding of files does not necessarily imply he was involved in drug trafficking. While this is not a declaration of his innocence, any details of US support for the Pinochet regime as part of broader Cold War policy -- even if unrelated to drug trafficking -- may have been deemed too diplomatically sensitive to release, especially given the atrocities committed during his rule. Accusing Pinochet of drug trafficking also carries a hint of irony. Despite his dark legacy , since Pinochet's iron fist rule Chile has been considered one of the safest countries in Latin America. Chile certainly did not emerge from the Pinochet-era on a trajectory towards greater involvement in the drug trade. While Chile does serve as a drug transshipment point and consumer nation , it has managed to avoid the rampant drug violence that plagues other parts of the region. Whether or not Pinochet is to thank for that, however, is up for debate."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Bolivia, Brazil, Peru to Use Seized Goods to Fight Crime. Bolivia, Peru and Brazil declared that they will create a joint fund using money seized from criminal groups to help in their fight against organized crime in the region, highlighting how this often untapped source of revenue can be utilized. Bolivia's interior minister, Carlos Romero, announced on November 15 that his government had agreed with Peru and Brazil to create a shared fund to fight organized crime, reported La Razon. The fund -- which, according to Romero, will be used to purchase technology used in the fight against crime and to pay informants -- will be financed primarily using money and assets seized from criminals. Both Peru and Brazil already have laws in place permitting the use of criminal assets by the state. Bolivia has yet to pass its own version of the law. Romero added that the three governments had agreed on a set of protocols to shoot down suspected drug trafficking planes, and that Peru will set up two radars along its border to help track drug flights. The announcements came during a tri-governmental meeting in the Peruvian capital, Lima. Goods seized from criminal gangs have the potential to provide governments in the region with a valuable source of funding in the fight against organized crime. Nicaragua, for example, announced last month that the government would build five new prisons , using a portion of the $9.2 million seized from a group of alleged cash smugglers currently on trial. But other countries have faced difficulties in redistributing criminal assets quickly and efficiently: in Honduras, one law meant to allow the government to use seized drug money has proved largely toothless , thanks to bureaucratic red tape. It is also noteworthy that Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru are all discussing implementing shoot-down protocols for suspected drug flights. Traffickers moving drugs by plane have made great use of routes through Brazil and Bolivia, as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) highlighted last year. In response to the problem, Bolivia has conducted joint exercises with the Brazilian Air Force and drafted a law last month that will enable Bolivia to shoot down suspected drug flights .	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Weekly InSight: Coca, Cocaine and Colombia. In our June 15 Facebook Live session, Co-director Steven Dudley and Senior Investigator Hector Silva Avalos talk about InSight Crime's special investigation of the criminal economy in Narino, Colombia and the impact the country's peace process is having on the regional cocaine trade. The conversation opened with Dudley breaking down a recent back-and-forth between US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Senator Marco Rubio about the Colombia-FARC peace process and the country's cocaine boom. During the congressional hearing, Tillerson hinted that Colombia should resume its aerial coca fumigation program, a strategy that arguably failed to effectively address coca cultivation in the long term. And some top US officials seemed to backtrack , a contradictory dynamic that both speakers agreed seemed commonplace in the Trump administration. Silva then talked about the local illicit economy in the Colombian department of Narino and how it shows the complexity of the country's coca dilemma. Silva described the first phase of the cocaine trade, beginning with the cultivation of the coca leaves by small farmers who then process it into a coca paste, which is later sold to more sophisticated intermediary groups that move it to criminal organizations who process and export the final product: the powdered cocaine. Circling back to Tillerson's comment on aerial fumigation, Silva explained how that approach mostly affects ""cocaleros,"" the coca growers at the bottom of the cocaine chain. ""In the province of Narino, coke is all that there is,"" he said, ""There is no other crop that will produce the same kind of profits."" The absence of the FARC in coca-producing regions is strongly felt by these local communities, Silva said. ""Due to the lack of the Colombian state, the FARC, in practical terms, was the state. They were referees for a lot of things, including the economy,"" he said. At the same time, armed actors like paramilitaries and FARC dissidents, are taking advantage of the guerrilla group's demobilization, which has led to more violence in these areas, explained the field investigator. Dudley and Silva also took a broader look at the global drug trade, where both cocaine production and consumption are increasing. In the end, controversial strategies like aerial coca fumigation have proven to be unviable over the long term, and they ignore the role that poor economic conditions and corruption have on the growth of coca plantations in Colombia.

"Police Riot in Ecuador. Chief of Ecuador police, Felipe Martinez, resigned Friday after the dramatic protests which President Correa and his supporters described as a ""coup attempt."" Chief of Ecuador police, Felipe Martinez, resigned Friday after the dramatic protests which President Correa and his supporters described as a ""coup attempt."" Riots broke out after the Ecuadorian National Assembly passed a law on Wednesday that increased salaries and cut bonuses for police officers. But how is the law going to affect Ecuador's police forces, and why were they unhappy enough to launch such strong demonstrations? According to some analysis from the Miami Herald , it was not so much the content of these laws that provoked the police uprising, but rather the lack of ""healthy debate"" and discussion. That is, it appears Correa pushed the law through Congress without lobbying police to support the legislation. So what does the ""Law of Public Service,"" as the legislation is known, actually do? It cuts some benefits, including Christmas gift baskets, and cuts bonuses awarded to officers for seniority or promotions. Police will now have to serve seven years, not five, in between rank promotions, and will no longer receive the cash bonuses ranging between $3,000 and $8,000, reports IPS. Correa has argued that these material bonuses have now been added into police officers' regular salaries, $792 a month, in contrast to the monthly salaries of $355 in place when he first took office. On one hand the law may be a well intentioned (but badly explained) attempt at the democratization of police salaries, but it is still not clear how the new law will better promote upward mobility within the police forces. Does the new law still encourage low-ranking officers to advance their careers, even to the highest ranks? It's not so much that financial incentives should be used to build a more effective police force, but with their cash bonuses gone, rank-and-file officers still need to see a path for promotion (perhaps with increased opportunities for training or education while rising in the ranks). It's not clear that the new law does anything to address this. Meanwhile Correa has accused at least two political rivals of having orchestrated Thursday's protests, and the Prosecutor General's Office is now investigating such allegations, reports El Comercio. It does not look as though the objective of the police-led protests was to oust Correa from power, and so far it looks like the president's popularity is now on the rise. Gallup reports that even before Thursday's ""golpe,"" more people approved of Correo's performance than those who expressed confidence in police forces. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Peru Confronts Extortion of Construction Companies. Over the past month, Peru's police have reportedly dismantled seven criminal groups dedicated to extorting the construction sector, a sign that authorities are intent on confronting this growing, yet little-known problem. Three of the groups were dismantled on November 17, reported Andina. Fourteen suspects from a gang called ""Los Malditos del Sur"" -- including four heads of construction unions -- were captured in Canete, just south of Lima. They are accused of extorting construction and real estate companies, creating front companies, and carrying out hired killings, reported El Comercio. Several members of two other extortion gangs that operated in and around Lima were also arrested. Days earlier, national police in the northern coastal province of La Libertad arrested 24 alleged members of ""Los Cagaleches"" and ""Los Wilos,"" accused of extortion, hired killings, robbery, drug trafficking and money laundering. Their victims reportedly included construction companies, the transport sector and other local businesses. Two additional gangs involved in extorting construction companies were taken down recently in La Libertad and Cajamarca provinces. Extortion gangs have also been tied to recent incidents involving explosives, including one thrown at the house of a businessman in northern Peru and a grenade that injured an employee and two youths at a store in Lima. Interior Minister Daniel Urresti said the government was ""intensifying"" police operations directed against extortion gangs, reported El Comercio. With these successive police operations and Urresti's statement, it appears Peru is honing in on a highly damaging and growing criminal industry. Last year, the head of Peru's criminal investigation unit (DIRINCRI) told InSight Crime that authorities were seeing an explosion of extortion-related activity directed primarily at the country's construction sector. As of July this year, construction companies just from Peru's northwest Piura region had filed 40 complaints of extortion in 2014 , while the secretary general for Peru's construction workers' federation (FTCCP) claimed that around 60 groups dedicated to construction-sector extortion operate throughout the country. Authorities say that many of these extortion groups pretend to be informal trade unions. The construction sector is not the only target: transport sector extortion in the northwestern city of Trujillo is worth an estimated $4 million a year. Some of Peru's most sophisticated and well-organized criminal groups are extortion gangs, making the rise of new groups dedicated to this activity a particular concern. Many of these operations are also protected and assisted by corrupt police , complicating efforts to root them out."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Humala Picks Surprise Candidate for Peru Police Chief. President Ollanta Humala selected a little-known Lima police chief to head Peru's National Police, amid a wave of shake-ups of the country's security forces. After several months of evaluation , Humala nominated Lieutenant General Raul Salazar to act as Peru's new police director. Salazar was selected over several prominent candidates, including the head of Peru's anti-narcotics office and a former intelligence director. Salazar previously served as head of security at the presidential palace, and until the announcement, was the acting police chief in a southern section of Peru's capital. The reshuffling of police leadership follows other personnel changes pushed by Humala, in which political outsiders were placed in key positions related to security and drug policy. Salazar replaces outgoing General Raul Becerra, who is among 30 top-ranking police officials being forced to retire. The obligatory retirements leave fewer than 15 high-ranking generals with active law enforcement roles in the National Police service and will move less experienced colonels into leadership positions. In announcing the reorganization, Humala emphasized that the changes were not punitive. However, several members of the police high command that are being retired are facing corruption allegations, and their removal will clear the way for disciplinary hearings into their behavior. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Zetas Turned Mexico Prison Into Mass Grave. An ongoing investigation into the Zetas has revealed how this violent criminal group used a prison to dispose of over 150 victims, focusing attention on the shocking level of corruption within Mexico's prison system and state governments. Investigators from the Disappeared Persons subdivision of Mexico's Attorney General's Office say the Zetas killed more than 150 people at the Piedras Negras prison in northern Coahuila state between 2010 and 2012, reported El Espanol. Victims were reportedly taken to the prison where Zetas members would kill them and often burn their bodies in diesel-filled barrels known as ""ovens."" The remains were then thrown into a nearby river, lead investigator Juan Jose Yanez was quoted as saying. The Zetas are believed to have been in control of Piedras Negras during the time period in which these atrocities occurred. The facility allegedly manufactured uniforms, bulletproof vests, and modified cars to hide drugs and weapons for the Zetas. Piedras Negras was also used as a hideout and base of operations for the criminal group, Yanez said. The investigation began in late 2014 after witnesses stated that two victims were last seen in or around Piedras Negras prison prior to their disappearance. Inmates later told investigators of numerous other cases in which Zetas members disposed of people in ""ovens,"" the report said. Speaking with La Jornada , Silvia Ortiz Solis of Grupo Vida (an organization working with families of the disappeared) disagreed with an assertion made by Yanez that most of the victims were from rival criminal groups. But both agreed the case indicated a shocking level of corruption within the prison and local government. ""I can't explain how something like this could happen without a reaction,"" Yanez commented. Investigators are reportedly looking into allegations of similar incidents at other prisons in Coahuila. The Zetas' brazen use of Piedras Negras prison as a dumping ground for their victims speaks to the level of corruption within Mexico's penitentiary system. Although this case dates back several years, Mexico has failed to enact significant reforms to its prison system since these barbarities reportedly took place. This became glaringly obvious last year when authorities arrested several top prison officials for their alleged role in the escape of notorious drug lord Joaquin "" El Chapo "" Guzman from a maximum security facility. The investigation calls attention to corruption not only within the prison system but Coahuila's government as well. The period during which the Zetas reportedly controlled Piedras Negras roughly coincides with Humberto Moreira's term as governor of Coahuila. Moreira was recently detained in Spain on money laundering charges and has been accused of links to the Zetas. In 2011, the Moreira administration blocked Mexico's National Human Rights Commission from visiting the prison. Whether intentional or not, this decision likely delayed authorities from discovering the Zetas' criminal operations inside the prison."	0	1	0	1	0	0	0
"Colombia Demobilization to Separate FARC from Criminal Activities. Colombia's congress has laid down conditions for the ""concentration zones"" where FARC guerrillas will demobilize in the event of a peace deal, which include plans to separate the rebels from their main criminal interests that could have serious implications for the country's underworld. Colombia's Senate and House of Representatives passed reforms to the country's Public Order Law that grant President Juan Manuel Santos the power to create areas where guerrilla fighters of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) will gather to turn in their arms and begin their reintegration into civilian life after a final peace deal is signed. The agreement lays down seven criteria that must be met for such zones, reported El Espectador. These include broad conditions regarding the size and number of zones and how monitoring of disarmament will take place. The criteria also include more specific provisions that the zones must not be in areas where there are coca crops or illegal mining activity or in border areas. The agreement was struck between the government's congressional bloc and the main opposition bloc headed by ex-President Alvaro Uribe, who led negotiations despite being Colombia's loudest voice against the peace process. ""For us, the rush is not to sign a peace agreement but to put a stop to [the FARC's] crimes,"" said Uribe. Despite the progress made on disarmament, President Santos addressed growing doubts that a final deal will be signed by the March 23 deadline established last October, saying that if there is no agreement by that date, negotiators will simply push back the deadline, reported El Colombiano. The FARC have been in formal peace negotiations with the government since November 2012. The decision to ensure concentration zones for a FARC demobilization that are far removed from the criminal activities with which the rebels fund themselves is likely motivated by several factors. The government is attempting to ensure a swift and complete break between the FARC and their primary criminal revenue streams, while also bringing on board the Uribe-led opposition, who have long professed that ending the FARC's involvement in criminal activity is their priority. However, it will mean local FARC units will be faced with a stark and sudden choice: abandon their lucrative criminal interests and comply with the peace process or refuse to assemble in the zones and continue to run their criminal activities, either as breakaway revolutionaries or as purely criminal groups. In addition, there is the possibility that some FARC units or members will later return to their coca or mining interests after becoming disillusioned with the process, which in itself could be problematic. The demobilization process is unlikely to be quick, giving other armed groups such as the guerrillas of the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) or the criminalized paramilitaries of the Urabenos an opportunity to move in on the criminal territories vacated by the FARC. In this scenario, FARC units looking to reclaim their interests would likely be faced with two options: either sign up with the rival groups or attempt to fight them off."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Police Discover Over 100 Captive CentAm Migrants in Texas Home. US authorities have discovered a home in Texas where human smugglers were keeping over 100 undocumented migrants against their will, providing a high-profile example of how organized crime manifests itself north of the border. At the house in southeast Houston, 94 men and 15 women were being held for ransom in squalid conditions, reported La Prensa Grafica. Houston police made the discovery after receiving a call from a Houston family about a woman who, along with her children, failed to appear with her human smuggler, or ""coyote,"" at a designated meeting point. Houston police spokesman John Cannon said inside the house they found ""bodies upon bodies, people stacked on top of each other."" The house had one partially functioning bathroom and no hot water, and human waste covered the floor, reported the New York Daily News. Migrants reported having been in the house anywhere from several days to two weeks. Greg Palmore, spokesperson for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), said this was the largest number of people discovered in such a house in five years, and that while it was too soon to determine if this was a human trafficking operation, it appeared so, reported Prensa Grafica. The migrants were principally from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador. Five men who appeared to be running the network have been detained. The road north for Latin American migrants attempting to reach the United States is filled with peril , with various criminal organizations collecting revenue from migrants by charging tolls along the route. Migrants also risk being kidnapped, beaten and raped by criminals. Migrants who undertake the journey often choose to employ the services of a professional smuggler, or ""coyote,"" to lower the chances of being victimized. These smugglers, however, are unreliable at best. With their ""clients"" beholden to them, coyotes are known to sometimes demand more money. There is also the risk of what Texas authorities have referred to as a ""coyote rip,"" when gangs kidnap migrants and demand ransom money. This occurred in a 2011 case involving MS13 members in Houston, in which the smuggler had apparently failed to pay a tax to the gang. The migrants in the current case may have been subject to a similar fate, while the sheer number of people being held captive suggests the smugglers were affiliated with a larger criminal network. It is also probable that there are other houses in the area being used for the same purpose."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Explosion in Cali Youth Gangs Fuels Drug Turf War in Colombia. An official report highlights the startling explosion of youth gangs in the city of Cali, Colombia, feeding the conflict between rival criminal groups the Urabenos and the Rastrojos. According to a report issued by the Cali Ombudsman's Office , the number of armed teenage gangs identified by the authorities rocketed from 10 in 1992 to 134 in 2012, a more than 13-fold increase. The last three years alone have seen 30 new groups spring up. Over 2,000 adolescents are now involved in gangs, which commit some 13 percent of murders in the city. They are also involved in drug dealing (microtrafficking), car theft and burglary, and generate internal displacement within the city, as well as constant casual violence. The report stated that of the 134 gangs, 66 are contracted by neo-paramilitary group the Urabenos or their drug cartel rivals the Rastrojos, who have been fighting a bitter turf war since the Urabenos first moved into the Valle del Cauca region in 2011. It should come as no surprise that the Urabenos and the Rastrojos are recruiting from the ranks of teenage gangs -- a time-tested method for large drug trafficking organizations in Colombia. As the report notes, ""The gangs serve as a source of cheap labor, easily accessible and, above all, disposable."" The gang members' status as minors, far from acting as a hindrance to recruitment, is actually a bonus for criminal groups, due to the difficulties of prosecuting and incarcerating minors, who in Colombia can only be sent to low-security detention centers and not prisons. For the gang members, associating with powerful international criminal organizations is a badge of honor that elevates their status among their peers. Many of the youths are willing to take big risks in exchange, making them ideal for the sort of dangerous and violent tasks required by mafias embroiled in a turf war. It is no coincidence the number of these gangs has rocketed in the era of large scale drug cartels in the city, beginning with the Cali Cartel, then the Norte del Valle Cartel, and now the feuding Rastrojos and Urabenos. The combination of poverty and lack of opportunities with the huge sums of money available from drug trafficking have created fertile terrain for organized crime, allowing criminal groups to use the city's youth as disposable soldiers."	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Brother of Urabenos Chief to Face Extradition to US. The brother of the maximum leader of Colombian neo-paramilitary group the Urabenos is to be extradited to the United States, a blow to the organization that nonetheless is unlikely to weaken its position as Colombia's leading drug gang. The Colombian Supreme Court has ruled in favor of extraditing Juan Diego Giraldo Usuga to Florida, where he will face charges of drug trafficking and criminal conspiracy. Usuga, brother of Urabenos leader Dario Antonio Usuga, alias ""Otoniel,"" was captured in the city of Medellin last year along with another brother John Fernando Usuga, alias ""Simon."" The two are alleged to have been responsible for the Urabenos criminal activities in 10 municipalities in the Colombian department of Antioquia and, according to the police, were in charge of approximately 400 men, reported El Espectador at the time. While Simon was wanted in both Colombia and the United States, Juan Diego Usuga had no outstanding charges in Colombia, only in the United States. (Download the US District Court of the Southern District of New York indictment of Dario Antonio Usuga and Juan de Dios Usuga below). The capture of Juan Diego and John Fernando Usuga was one of a series of blows against key Urabenos figures and the Usuga family in 2012. In January, security forces killed the Urabenos co-leader Juan de Dios Usuga, alias ""Giovanni."" This was followed by the arrest of Juan Diego and John Fernando in May and, in July, of another Usuga brother, Alexander Montoya Usuga, alias ""El Flaco,"" who played a key role in maintaining relationships with Central American groups. In October, Henry de Jesus Lopez, alias ""Mi Sangre,"" who led the Urabenos push into Medellin and maintained international trafficking routes, was arrested in Argentina. Nevertheless, the group has continued to aggressively expand and looks set to become the dominant criminal organization in Colombia under the leadership of the remaining Usuga brother, Otoniel. Despite the risk Juan Diego Usuga will offer information in exchange for more lenient treatment in the US, this surge is likely to continue."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Guatemala Poppy Eradication Campaign Takes on Rising Cultivation. Authorities in Guatemala have eradicated 65 hectares of poppy despite fierce resistance from farmers, as the country struggles to tackle record amounts of opium poppy cultivation along the border with Mexico. Members of the Guatemalan police and army first tried to launch an eradication campaign in the department of San Marcos on January 27, but were forced back after they were attacked by farmers armed with rocks, sticks and firebombs. Four police were injured in the assault. On January 31, the security forces returned and successfully uprooted poppy plants that authorities says were worth over $94 million, reported EFE. The new year campaign follows on from last year's eradication efforts, which according to the authorities, saw the destruction of 2,500 hectares of poppy- capable of producing $3.2 billion worth of heroin, according to official estimates. While accurate estimates of the amount of poppy cultivated in Guatemala have often been hard to come by, all indications are cultivation is now reaching record levels. In the early 1990s, Guatemala was one of the region's main poppy producer countries, reaching a peak of 2,500 hectares cultivated in 1991, according to the US State Department. However, an aerial eradication campaign during the early 90s supposedly reduced cultivation to less than 10 hectares hidden away in tiny mountainside plots. Between 2000 and 2004, eradication efforts fell away to virtually nothing, reported elPeriodico. In the first year they began again, 489 hectares was eradicated, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), suggesting cultivation had rapidly bounced back. By 2011, the State Department was reporting that despite the eradication of 1,490 hectares of poppy, Guatemala was a net poppy producer of over 1,000 hectares. The rise in eradication claimed by the government for 2013 is likely linked to increased efforts to tackle cultivation -- including the deployment of a specialist military brigade to San Marcos. However, it is highly unlikely they are eradicating the entire crop, suggesting cultivation now exceeds the highs seen in the 1990s. Guatemalan poppy cultivation is almost entirely focused in the province of San Marcos, which borders Mexico in the south (see map below). The region has long been the fiefdom of Guatemalan traffickers with ties to the Sinaloa Cartel, principally the Ortiz Lopez cartel, which was once headed by the notorious Juan Ortiz Lopez, alias ""Juan Chamale,"" who was arrested in 2011."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Anti-Corruption Probe Implicates President, Opposition. Authorities in Honduras have accused dozens of officials and collaborators of diverting millions of dollars of public money for political purposes, including to fund President Juan Orlando Hernandez's 2013 campaign. But the explosive allegations are likely to generate strong pushback from the suspects and their allies, potentially hindering the progress of the case. On June 13, as part of a corruption investigation dubbed the ""Pandora Case,"" prosecutors from a special unit of Honduras' Attorney General's Office and the internationally-backed Support Mission Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (Mision de Apoyo contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad en Honduras - MACCIH) presented the country's Supreme Court with information about 38 government officials and other individuals accused of misusing more than 282 million lempiras (nearly $12 million) of government funds. Those accused allegedly stole public funds destined for agricultural development projects, which they then funneled through various foundations and non-governmental organizations before using the money for political purposes. Part of the funds allegedly helped finance a program tauted by then-candidate Hernandez in 2013 called the ""Cachureca Card."" (""Cachureca"" is Honduran slang meaning politically conservative.) The program allowed cardholders to recieve sizeable discounts at participating businesses. Other funds were siphoned off to support political campaigns for the opposition Liberal Party and another smaller party known as the Broad Front. Prosecutors did not make the names of the suspects public, but local media reports suggest those implicated may include a number of congressmen from Hernandez's National Party and a former Liberal Party presidential candidate, among others. The National Party responded to the accusations by stating the party would cooperate with the investigation but that the ""responsibility is individual."" In comments reported by La Prensa , President Hernandez said that, ""It is essential that justice is served. Nobody is above the law, but as well as the principle of the rule of law, the principle of innocence is what we should all look for."" The latest allegations come after Hernandez was declared the winner of a November 2017 election strongly questioned by the opposition and international observers due to credible indications of fraud. Elites in Central America have recently been waging an all-out offensive against anti-corruption efforts for some time, and it's unclear how far the case against Hernandez and other officials in Honduras will be able to progress in the face of this onslaught. Charles Call, the head of American University's special research team on MACCIH and anti-impunity efforts in Honduras, told InSight Crime that it's ""too early to tell what the implications of this case are going to be."" However, he noted that past experience suggests elites aligned against anti-corruption efforts may be able to stall the case. ""The courts and Congress have found ways to get around these types of indictments in the past, and it's possible they might do that again,"" Call said. Christine Wade, a Central America expert and political science professor at Washington College, told InSight Crime that it's ""difficult to be optimistic"" about the future of anti-corruption efforts in Honduras. ""Over the past several years, elites in Honduras have had nothing but disdain for the MACCIH and have tried to completely undermine its investigatory capacity,"" Wade said. Indeed, lawmakers recently attacked the constitutionality of the MACCIH. While the Supreme Court later ruled the body to be constitutional, the decision also restricted collaboration between the MACCIH and a special unit the body works with to build corruption cases, which could undermine the effectiveness of the anti-graft body all together. Legislators in Honduras also passed a reform earlier this year dubbed an "" impunity pact , "" which essentially robbed the Attorney General's Office of the ability to effectively investigate the misuse of public funds. However, Eric Olson, the director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Latin American program, told InSight Crime that it's important to recognize that the MACCIH and the Attorney General's Office decided to go forward with the investigation despite these obstacles. "" The scenario is incredibly adverse for the Attorney General's Office and anti-corruption efforts in Honduras, but they've taken the step anyway,"" Olson said. All of this comes in the context of growing concern among civil society organizations regarding the country's anti-corruption drive as the selection of a new attorney general approaches later this year. The MACCIH is also still without a permanent leader after the February resignation of Juan Jimenez Mayor due to what he said was a lack of institutional support. In addition, President Hernandez is one of the United States' closest allies in Central America. Washington has continued to support him amid other corruption allegations , which has given him some political cover from multiple swirling scandals. Both Olson and Wade agreed that the latest corruption investigation will likely hit a number of roadblocks. According to Wade, ""elites in Honduras have little to no interest in prosecuting themselves."""	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"Paraguay Currency Exchanges Launder Vast Amounts of Brazil Drug Money. Brazilian criminal gangs were able to use official currency exchanges in Paraguay to launder over $1.5 billion in drug money, showing how the country continues to be a paradise for organized crime groups seeking to hide their profits. An investigation in early August by Brazilian police in the city of Foz do Iguacu revealed that four gangs managed to launder 6.5 billion reais (around $1.5 billion) and use it to pay for a wide range of contraband goods, especially cigarettes and drugs acquired in Paraguay between 2010 and 2018. The gangs created bank accounts with fake identification or through ghost companies to deposit large amounts of money, according to the police statement. The gangs used a network of currency exchanges inside Paraguay. These would certify the money in reais had been deposited and then deliver the equivalent amount in US dollars to Paraguayan suppliers, thus legalizing the ""dirty"" money. To make this sophisticated operation work, the exchange houses used ""black dollars,"" legal US tender which circulates in the country parallel to the currency officially registered with the Central Bank of Paraguay while maintaining the same value. Official currency exchanges being used to launder over $1.5 billion with impunity will do nothing to improve Paraguay's reputation as a money-laundering hub. The government is seemingly unable or unwilling to bring money laundering to heel despite Paraguay having faced accusations as serious as helping the likes of Hezbollah launder funds. The success of these four Brazilian gangs, who were not all acting together, was at least partially based on lax controls within Paraguay's money laundering supervision body, Seprelad. It was only in late July that the country's central bank began demanding that currency exchanges track and record the origin of funds used in their cross-border operations. Worse, Paraguay's leadership has sometimes seemed to pride itself on its lack of fiscal controls. Speaking at the 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos, President Mario Abdo Benitez called his country ""almost a fiscal paradise."" The continued boom in the cross-border illegal cigarette trade is another sign of institutional apathy towards this black market. Former president Horacio Cartes has been repeatedly linked to the sale of illegal cigarettes in Brazil and across Latin America. This problem is beginning to have a serious impact on Brazil. This investigation was carried out by Brazilian police against Brazilian gangs, but as long as Paraguay refuses to crack down on money laundering, it will remain a convenient staging point for its neighbor's criminal groups to hide their loot."	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
At Rio Carnival, Crime and Corruption Overshadow Brazils Biggest Party. Brazil's biggest annual celebration came to a close amid several indications of deepening insecurity in Rio de Janeiro, as well as ongoing concerns about corruption and criminal infiltration of politics in the country's second-largest city. Despite the 17,000 police working throughout the February 9 to February 13 holiday, violence was a significant issue as mobs of youths assaulted and robbed tourists in areas customarily thought to be safe. Meanwhile, confrontations with criminals left three police dead and two wounded. The samba schools, several of which used their high-profile parades to highlight issues of insecurity and corruption, themselves were marred by allegations of graft. Beija-Flor, the eventual carnival champions, included in its exhibition depictions of gang violence in marginalized neighborhoods and a giant rat meant to symbolize corrupt politicians. At the same time, the president of the organization is currently contesting a 48-year conviction for racketeering and corruption. The president of another major samba school is also being investigated for money laundering. The security problems during Carnival seemed to stem from a lack of organization on the part of city officials. Mayor Marcelo Crivella was traveling in Europe for the entirety of the festivities, and the security plan for the event changed drastically in the middle of the holiday after the spike in violence. (Last year, thousands of military police were sent to the city ahead of the celebration to reinforce security.) On February 16, just days after the end of Carnival, President Michel Temer signed a decree for the national military to take total control of security operations in the state of Rio de Janeiro, including assuming command of civilian police forces. The federal intervention will last until the end of the year. Rio's carnival was hoped by many to provide a respite from the problems that have plagued the city. Instead, the event served as a reminder that the issues of rising violence and deep-seated corruption remain front and center in the minds of the Brazilian public. As reflected in a number of the samba school performances, recent surveys have shown mounting concern among Rio's residents about insecurity related to gang violence. Entire neighborhoods have come under siege as crime groups continue to battle the police and each other. The official response to the crisis -- repeated waves of militarization -- has not shown long-term success. And the head of the armed forces recently warned that involving the military in civilian security operations could lead to corruption among the troops. But momentum for a change in strategy has been hindered by a lack of resources and political will. SEE ALSO : Brazil News and Profiles Likewise, the allegations of corruption against leaders of the samba schools point to a system that is still struggling to deal with deep-rooted graft. Despite a years-long anti-corruption drive that has reached the highest echelons of political and economic power in Brazil, the issue is playing a prominent role in the run-up to general elections scheduled for October -- particularly in Rio. A Federal Police report recently obtained by O Globo highlighted the risk of partnerships between local politicians and the heads of criminal organizations aimed at influencing the outcome of the elections. This report comes on the heels of accusations that President Michel Temer's pick for labor secretary, Cristiane Brasil, paid drug traffickers for exclusive access to campaign in 2010 in a suburb of Rio. Crime groups were also accused of attempting to intervene in 2016's municipal elections in Rio through a combination of political violence and illicit campaign financing.	0	1	0	1	0	0	0
"Mexico City Sees 69% Drop in Inmate Population. Overcrowding in Mexico City's prisons has fallen by 69 percent over the last four months thanks to reforms in the criminal justice system that could offer a solution for other Latin American countries with overpopulated penitentiary systems. According to Hazael Ruiz Ortega, the Undersecretary for Mexico City's Penitentiary System, the reduction is due to a reclassification of the types of crimes that are considered jailable offenses, reported El Universal. In January, Mexico's Federal District reformed the criminal justice system so that several offenses -- such as domestic disputes, arguments between neighbors, threats, and physical fights resulting in minor injuries -- no longer go to trial. In addition, individuals accused of armed robbery or manslaughter resulting from negligence can now post bond instead of spending time in jail while criminal proceedings are underway. The reforms have reportedly had a huge impact on Mexico City's prison population, where at least 20,582 -- or 54 percent -- of the Federal District's 38,160 inmates are behind bars for some type of robbery, according to government statistics cited by El Universal. Ruiz Ortega noted that petty theft like the robbery of auto parts worth around $30 or less used to result in one to two year sentences, ""saturating the country's prisons"". Mexico has long struggled with growing inmate populations and serious overcrowding in its prisons , and is currently in the midst of implementing judicial reforms. These problems have been exacerbated by the fact that 95 percent of all crimes are punishable by prison sentences in Mexico, and by the widespread use of pre-trial detention , which has resulted in inmates waiting in jail for several months before charges are even filed against them. Overcrowding has also led to deplorable conditions, contributing to riots and violence among inmates, and allowing gangs to take control of an estimated 65 percent of the country's prisons. These problems affect prison systems throughout Latin America. Indeed, the widespread practice of pre-trial detention in other parts of the region has also resulted in endemic overcrowding. In addition, gangs and other criminal groups use prisons as a base of operations to conduct criminal activities like extortion , and to recruit and train new members. Several countries have recently taken steps to address these issues, the most recent example being Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos' May 19 announcement of the allocation of $480 million to improve the country's prison system. While increased investment in prisons will likely help improve conditions, changes in sentencing guidelines like the ones implemented in Mexico City could prove an effective and low-cost model for reducing overcrowding in other Latin American countries."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Nicaragua Charges Man Linked to Facundo Cabral Killing with Drug Trafficking. A judge in Nicaragua ruled that the man who allegedly plotted the attack which killed Argentine singer Facundo Cabral will be charged in Nicaragua for drug trafficking and money laundering. Costa Rican Alejandro Jimenez Gonzalez, alias ""Palidejo,"" is currently being tried in Guatemala, where Cabral was killed last year. Besides Palidejo, the criminal court in Managua said it would prosecute another 20 people accused of running a drug trafficking network that stretched from Costa Rica to Mexico, reports EFE. On May 27, Nicaraguan police announced they had arrested 11 of Palidejo's associates, including a former judge who once served on Nicaragua's electoral council. Palidejo is accused of hiring gunmen to kill a nighclub owner who stole a cocaine shipment from him. But the hitmen killed Cabral during the attack, as Cabral was traveling in a car with the nightclub owner at the time. Palidejo is now enmeshed in legal cases in at several countries, including Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, where he is wanted for money laundering. It is also not clear whether his name was among those that were blacked out in a US indictment issued by a New York court in 2006. This would mean Palidejo is also wanted for drug trafficking charges in the US. Palidejo's case points to the existence of a complex transnational network that moved cocaine from Colombia through Central America to the US. The Costa Rican was reportedly under the protection of Colombian group the Rastrojos , who likely served as one of his primary suppliers of product. He has also been linked to a Mexican drug trafficking organization with ties to the Familia Michoacana. "	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
Guatemala Prisons at 280% Capacity: Study. A recent report indicates that Guatemala's prisons are at 280 percent over capacity, a problem exacerbated by poor management, which is feeding growing criminality within the penitentiary system, and effectively handing inmates control over many installations. According to a report published by Guatemala's National Economic Research Center (CIEN) on August 6, as of June this year, 17,942 people occupied the country's 6,412 prison spaces, with 49 percent of inmates held in pre-trial detention. This rate of overcrowding -- which ranges from three to six prisoners per available space -- places Guatemala's penitentiary system among the ten most overcrowded in the world. The study blames a sharp increase in incarcerations since 2009. The report also discusses how overcrowding leads to a lack of control over prisoners, thus allowing inmates to commit crimes while incarcerated. According to Public Ministry figures cited in the report, prisoners perpetrate approximately 80 percent of the country's extortion cases. Furthermore, it highlights a lack of adequate investment in jails. An analysis of basic infrastructure within the prisons -- such as electrical installations and water supply -- found that only six percent of the country's 22 prisons had adequate infrastructure. The country's penitentiary system also lacks exact information on the duration of the prison sentences of 40 percent of inmates, the report states. Overpopulated prisons are a serious problem in numerous Latin American countries. According to the CIEN report, Central America is one region with especially high levels of prison overcrowding, led by El Salvador (322 percent), and followed by Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. Prison overpopulation in the region has been fuelled partly by iron fist security policies and -- as demonstrated by the CIEN report -- long pre-trial detention periods. This phenomenon has been credited with facilitating crime and gang activity, which is especially apparent in El Salvador, where prisons have become recruitment hubs for the country's powerful street gangs. Numerous countries in the region have also seen prison overcrowding lead to deadly riots and massacres. These issues are exacerbated by official corruption within prisons. Guatemala's penitentiary system reportedly has a high level of institutional corruption, which has facilitated the development of a prison black market. Officials allegedly profit from inmates, charging over $19,000 for a prison transfer and between $12 and $38 to remove prisoners from solitary confinement.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Bolivia to Investigate Police Ties to Foreign Cartels. Bolivia announced that it will open investigations into links between corrupt officials and foreign drug trafficking organizations in the eastern department of Santa Cruz, reopening the question of how far international cartels have a presence in the country. The Bolivian government formally asked the Santa Cruz Attorney General's Office to investigate ties between local officials and foreign drug trafficking organizations. Documents containing allegations against at least six officials were handed to prosecutor Marco Antonio Rodriguez on August 14, reported Milenio. Among the accused are officers belonging to Santa Cruz's anti-narcotics police unit (FELCN), international police agency Interpol, a former air force colonel, and members of the Santa Cruz city police force. They are suspected of colluding with Colombian, Mexican and Brazilian drug traffickers in networks that operated throughout the country, passing through La Paz and the departments of Cochabamba and Santa Cruz, according to La Razon. The issue of whether foreign gangs have a presence in Bolivian territory has been a contentious point for the administration of President Evo Morales. Colombian Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin stated in June that Colombian drug gangs were present in Bolivia, and there have even been reports that the head of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel , Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, had stayed in the country at some point. Though Morales has recognised that Mexican and Colombian traffickers operate in Bolivia, he stated he couldn't support Holguin's claims of a fully-fledged cartel presence. Bolivian Social Defense Deputy Minister Felipe Caceres referred to the traffickers as being mere "" emissaries "" for cartels. Santa Cruz is a key location for the drug trade thanks to its location between Bolivia's largest coca-producing department, Cochabamba, and Latin America's largest consumer of cocaine, Brazil. In one operation in May this year, more than 90 cocaine labs were dismantled and a clandestine airstrip for drug flights was destroyed in Santa Cruz. Colombian intelligence officials have estimated that as many as 3,000 Colombian traffickers may operate there, and there is evidence that Brazilian gangs the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) and First Capital Command (PCC) also run networks from the department into Brazil. Bolivia appears to be growing in importance to foreign traffickers. Mexican publication El Universal reported last month that Bolivia may now be the second largest supplier of cocaine to Mexican cartels after Colombia, based on information it received from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Mexican cartels may have also installed laboratories to process synthetic drugs in the country, according to the report. In a speech to Congress earlier this month, Morales stated that drug trafficking and corruption were the two biggest problems facing the country. Accusations of narco-corruption have hit high-level officials, with former drug czar Rene Sanabria reportedly declaring earlier this year that the government was actively hindering investigations into corruption. Sanabria is currently serving a 15 year prison term in the US for cocaine smuggling. The country's presidency minister has also been accused of having ties to a jailed Brazilian cocaine smuggler. However, some of the allegations that the government is failing to investigate drug corruption cannot be detached from political motives. "	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Reported Narco-Summit Could Herald Upheaval for Mexico Underworld. The leaders of some of Mexico's principal drug cartels recently staged a narco-summit to reconfigure the criminal landscape, according to reports in local media, which, if accurate, could mark the start of a new anti-Sinaloa Cartel criminal alliance. Mexican newspaper Reforma reported that it obtained US and Mexican intelligence documents which indicate that the Zetas, the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO), the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG), and the Juarez Cartel met in June in Piedras Negras, a town on the US border in the state of Coahuila. According to the documents, the summit was attended by Juarez Cartel chief Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, alias ""El Viceroy,"" the head of the CJNG Nemesio Oseguera, alias ""El Mencho,"" the ostensible head of the Zetas, Omar Trevino Morales, alias ""Z42? and Fausto Isidro Meza, alias ""Chapo Isidro"", an up-and-coming power in the BLO and trusted lieutenant to cartel chief Hector Beltran Leyva, ""El H."" According to Reforma, the purpose of the meeting was to form an alliance to redraw the map of drug trafficking in Mexico. The reports of the top-level narco-summit are based on one as-yet unconfirmed source and so should be approached with caution, but if the meeting did take place it could mark the start of major changes in the world of Mexican organized crime. The groups involved are some of the biggest names in drug trafficking, and together have a presence in 20 of Mexico's 31 states, according to Reforma. However, they are also a mix of groups struggling to maintain their position in the face of a rapidly evolving underworld and the threat of the Sinaloa Cartel juggernaut. At one point the Zetas were the main threat to the Sinaloans, but infighting and the loss of leaders have left a fragmented force of ever-more independent cells reduced to living off the proceeds of localized crimes such as extortion and kidnapping. Similarly, the Juarez Cartel was a bitter enemy of the Sinaloans, but the long and vicious war for the Juarez border crossing left the group a defeated shadow of the powerful organization it once was. In contrast, the BLO was once part of the same federation as the Sinaloa Cartel, but since 2008 the two have been engaged in a bitter war, which has taken a toll on the BLO's leadership. Meanwhile, the CJNG is a relatively new organization that has grown in power rapidly but whose influence remains confined to a relatively small geographical area. It is likely that a key aspect of any pact between these groups would be an alliance to take on their shared enemy, the Sinaloa Cartel. However, any agreement may also involve reconfiguring drug trafficking operations to reflect new realities. None of the groups involved have the expansive territorial presence or hierarchical organizational control they once enjoyed, making the business of drug trafficking much more difficult. To adapt to this new decentralized, fragmented reality, it would make sense to adopt the model now used by Colombian drug trafficking groups , which underwent a similar process. This would involve cooperating in a decentralized network that plays to the respective strengths of the different groups, such as drug trafficking contacts, production facilities, or control of movement corridors and border crossings."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"US Sanctions on Venezuela President Promise Zero Impact, Experts Say. The rare move by the United States to place economic sanctions on Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro will do little to reduce criminality within his regime and across his beleaguered country. The question is whether matters could get worse in criminal terms. The US Treasury Department added Maduro to its list of ""specially designated nationals"" on July 31, thereby freezing all of his US assets and prohibiting American businesses from dealing with him. According to a Treasury Department press release , the action was taken under the authority of a 2015 presidential order, ""which authorizes sanctions against current or former officials of the Government of Venezuela and others undermining democracy in Venezuela."" It is not clear what, if any, assets Maduro has in the United States. But the move does carry some symbolic impact, coming the day after Maduro claimed a sweeping victory in a controversial election to create a new constitutional assembly. The July 30 voting process was marred by violent clashes between demonstrators and authorities, as well as allegations of fraud on the part of the government. The new political body is expected to replace the current opposition-controlled National Assembly, and it is likely Maduro will use it to consolidate power even further as the regime faces down almost daily street protests that have been running since April, during which dozens have died. ""Yesterday's illegitimate elections confirm that Maduro is a dictator who disregards the will of the Venezuelan people,"" said US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a July 31 statement regarding the sanctions. The new measures come less than a week after the administration of US President Donald Trump sanctioned 13 current and former Venezuelan officials for ""undermining democracy."" Among them was Interior Minister Nestor Reverol, who was appointed to his current position by Maduro the day after being indicted by the United States for allegedly participating in a transnational cocaine trafficking network. Venezuela's prisons chief Iris Varela, accused of overseeing the abdication of the penitenciary system to the control of its inmates, was also sanctioned last week. It is unusual for the United States to target heads of state with economic sanctions. Maduro joins a short list of sanctioned leaders that includes the recently-deceased former dictator of Panama Manuel Noriega , Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, North Korea's Kim Jong Un, Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe and former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Hours after the sanctions against Maduro were announced, authorities reportedly rearrested Leopoldo Lopez -- a prominent opposition leader who was recently moved from prison to house arrest after more than three years in a cell -- and Antonio Ledezma, another high-profile opposition voice. As InSight Crime pointed out last week, sanctions against top Venezuelan officials will likely serve to further isolate the regime, consolidating international pressure upon it and offering moral support to Venezuela's opposition. But they are unlikely to significantly weaken Maduro's grip on power, and could even prompt him and his allies to dig in further. ""Maduro will brush off the sanctions imposed by the US like one would brush off a pesky gnat,"" Mike Vigil, a retired Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent with decades of experience in Latin America, told InSight Crime. ""Venezuela, unfortunately, is now a failed state and narco regime."" Vigil and other international experts consulted by InSight Crime also expect this week's economic sanctions to have zero impact on Maduro's behaviour -- or at least none of the type of impact that the Trump administration might hope to see. ""Individual sanctions have never had an impact on the political or economic processes that would force or bring about changes on despotic regimes. Also, broader sanctions on Venezuela's oil-based economy would cause only more misery for the innocent citizens of Venezuela. The [latest sanctions] by the White House are nothing more than bluster,"" said Vigil. Despite rumours that the United States is planning to slap sanctions on Venezuela's state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA), those measures have not been announced. When asked during a press conference whether oil sanctions were a possibility, Mnuchin said the US government would ""continue to review all of our options."" Criminality within government ranks may be a motiviating factor behind the Maduro administration's rejection of the sanctions. Should Maduro and his allies be ousted, and should the opposition take over the executive branch, it is highly likely that criminal proceedings will be used to keep the Chavistas as far from power as possible. This gives the Maduro regime a strong incentive to try to maintain its grip, even if it involves extreme measures. ""The regime is already criminalized, and I'm not sure how much more criminalized it could become,"" Douglas Farah, president of national security consulting firm IBI Consultants, told InSight Crime. Maduro's vice president Tareck El Aissami was sanctioned in early 2017 by the United States for his alleged ties to the drug trade, and more than a dozen current or former high-ranking officials have either been sanctioned or indicted for crimes related to drug trafficking. Maduro's own nephews were convicted in the United States in November 2016 for conspiring to traffic 800 kilograms of cocaine into US territory. Pro-government groups in Caracas and around the country known as ""colectivos"" are also becoming increasingly criminalized and are now active in kidnapping, extortion and microtrafficking, according to field research by InSight Crime. The military, the regime's major pillar of support, is profiting from food and fuel trafficking as well as the international cocaine trade. Organized criminal networks control the country's prison system , and have given birth to a number of megabandas (large criminal gangs) on Venezuela's streets. ""With all the anarchy, with all the chaos spilling out into the street, that is going to be taken advantage of by the criminal groups there. It will definitely increase drug trafficking; I think you will see more and more Colombian organizations moving into Venezuela and a lot of people will go into the drug trade because they have no option -- there's no jobs, no money, no supplies,"" said Vigil. Although Maduro and his inner circle all have a personal interest in maintaining the status quo due to the indictments and sanctions against them, Ralph Espach , director of Latin American and strategic affairs at the think tank CNA, thinks that ideology could still be a major motivator for key members of the regime. ""I wonder if maybe in Washington we are underestimating their ideological commitment. We like to describe them as crooks, and traffickers, and corrupt, not as ideological warriors (like the Castros) who are generally far more willing to allow the country to suffer, especially the former middle class/upper class and elites,"" said Espach via email. ""It could well be that they are thinking like Cuban revolutionaries, and are focused on sustaining the 'revolution,' even if it may last decades, and perfectly willing to contemplate the exodus of another million Venezuelans from the country or more, until oil prices go up again or they can get some special assistance from China or someone and ride this out."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"FARC Commander Denies Rebels Have Been Weakened. The FARC has released a video in which commander 'Ivan Marquez' denies the government's claims that the rebel group has been weakened, in what may be an attempt to project an image of strength in case the group enters peace talks. In the video (see below), Marquez denies that the guerrillas have reached ""the end,"" as the authorities have claimed. He states that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) are ready to fight, and will continue to seek support abroad. Marquez also described the guerrillas as a legitimate political group, declaring that they have a right to rebellion enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and that it is wrong to classify their actions as ""terrorism."" FARC guerrillas killed six soldiers on Saturday in an ambush on the road between Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city, and Quibdo, capital of the Pacific province of Choco. Commander of the Army's 7th Division General Hernan Giraldo said that members of the guerrillas' 34th Front detonated explosives when an army patrol came to the area to investigate reports of a rebel attack, reports the AFP. The security forces killed three guerrillas in clashes. InSight Crime's Analysis The video was released days after the rebels released their last 10 political hostages , in a move that has been widely interpreted as a step towards peace negotiations with the government. Along with the Choco attack, the video seems to be part of an effort by the rebels to approach the negotiating table in a position of power. The government has also struck heavy blows against the rebels as peace talks emerge as an increasingly real prospect, killing more than 70 guerrillas in two bombing raids on FARC camps in March. The authorities said the attacks were part of their new strategy to hit the group's wealthiest fronts, to undermine their capacity to carry out operations, as opposed to focusing on taking out the group's leaders. There is speculation that talks between the government and the rebels may already have begun, with reports that President Juan Manuel Santos has asked Cuba's leadership to act as intermediaries. However, Santos may prefer to wait until he wins a second term in 2014, when he would not have to worry about the prospect of failed talks hurting his re-election chances. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Convicted Drug Traffickers, Terrorists Among Peru Election Candidates. At least 345 political candidates in Peru have been convicted of a crime, including drug trafficking and terrorism, indicating a culture of impunity among the country's political elite and raising serious questions about electoral standards. According to Francisco Tavara, the president of Peru's national electoral authority (JNE), the most common convictions were for failing to pay child support, reported El Comercio. Some of the crimes were more serious, however. Three of the candidates for the October 5 elections have been convicted for drug trafficking, three for terrorism, three for rape, and three for kidnapping. None of the candidates who have been convicted for drug trafficking admitted to their criminal history in their sworn declarations, reported La Republica. Tavara stated that these candidates would be referred to the electoral juries , who would prevent them from participating in the upcoming elections. In addition to these three candidates, the current mayor of the Cochorcos district in the northeastern province La Libertad -- Julio Cesar Diaz Carrasco -- has been convicted for drug trafficking and plans to run for reelection. The number of candidates with criminal records highlights a serious problem with corruption and criminal ties within Peruvian politics. Three of the country's recent presidents have been implicated in criminal activity , including former President Alan Garcia, who has been investigated for allegedly participating in a pay-for-pardons scheme. Last year, three governors, five members of Congress, and 11 mayors were investigated for drug trafficking , and according to the Anti-Corruption Attorney General's Office an estimated 92 percent of the country's mayors are currently under investigation for corruption. The current batch of candidates appears to be particularly problematic. Just last week, Interior Minister Daniel Urresti, who is himself currently facing a murder investigation , stated that 115 candidates in the upcoming elections have been linked to drug trafficking cases. The fact that candidates who have been convicted of drug trafficking, terrorism, rape and kidnapping managed to make it past the sworn declarations stage of the electoral process indicates that the country lacks effective mechanisms for weeding criminals out of its electoral system. It also points to a belief on the part of the candidates that electoral authorities either would not realize they had criminal records or would not prevent them from running for office, which are both troubling indications of a widespread culture of impunity.	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Ecuador Investigates $135 Mn in Latest ALBA Export Scam. Prosecutors in Ecuador are investigating $135 million in suspicious transactions that flowed through a shared virtual currency system with Venezuela, highlighting the ways criminals can exploit financial systems designed to facilitate trade for their own gain. According to Attorney General Galo Chiriboga, the Attorney General's Office has started investigating $135 million in ""illegal exports"" to Venezuela that flowed through the Unitary System of Regional Compensation (which goes by the Spanish acronym SUCRE), a virtual currency adopted in 2009 by members of the regional trade bloc ALBA that was designed to ease trade, reported Agence France-Presse. Exporters allegedly sent only $3 million worth of goods to Venezuela, but claimed income of over $130 million, according to AFP, a money-laundering tactic known as trade mis-invoicing. The money reportedly stayed in Ecuador for only 72 hours, eventually heading to the United States, Venezuela, and other tax havens. Although the attorney general did not specify which companies are under investigation or on which dates the suspicious transactions occurred, their investigation was likely prompted by an investigation published in April by Ecuadorian newspaper El Universo , Miami-based newspaper El Nuevo Herald , and Venezuelan journalist outlet Armando.info. In that investigation (which InSight Crime translated here ) reporters uncovered $238 million in suspicious SUCRE transactions involving 60 Venezuelan companies and 30 Ecuadorian companies, much of which ended up in Panama and Florida. Companies routinely overvalued their exports, allowing them to launder vast amounts of money, and in some cases claimed exports that never existed at all. Trade mis-invoicing happens when companies claim their exports are worth more than they actually cost. In one case cited by the Wall Street Journal , an Ecuadorian exporter claimed a one-kilo shipment of calcium carbonate cost $1,000, when in reality calcium carbonate costs 17 cents. That extra $999.83 can then be claimed as legitimate income, allowing illicitly obtained profits to enter the financial system. Hundreds of millions of dollars pass through the SUCRE every year, much of it legitimate trade. See the Wall Street Journal's graphic below on how the SUCRE actually works: Claiming overvalued exports is not just a money-laundering tactic. In Venezuela, both importers and exporters routinely overvalue their products to get access to the government's preferential exchange rate, allowing them to sell cheaply obtained dollars for much higher rates on the black market, where strict currency controls have created vibrant, but illegal, parallel currency exchange markets, according to the New York Times. The latest investigation is far from the first when it comes to illegal use of ALBA's SUCRE. In 2013, authorities deemed over five percent of SUCRE transactions suspicious , and numerous reports have chronicled how Ecuadorian and Venezuelan banks, as well as importers and exporters have abused the virtual currency. If the latest investigation is any indication, the amount of suspicious SUCRE transactions could well exceed that five percent figure."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Hacker Network Foiled in $70 Million Bank Heist. A transnational criminal group nearly pulled off a historic cyber-heist of one of Colombia's biggest banks, highlighting how even the most advanced cyber security systems can be breached by what could soon be seen as the most common form of crime in the region. A total of 17 computer hackers have been arrested by Colombia's investigative police department DIJIN for attempting to steal roughly $70 million in January from the bank giant Bancolombia, reported El Tiempo. ""It would have been the robbery of the century,"" a representative of the DIJIN said of the failed criminal operation, reported El Espectador. A man identified as Faber Restrepo is considered the head of the network. Restrepo allegedly used his job working as a consultant for Bancolombia to steal security passwords from the bank and make illicit money transfers to 356 accounts, according to El Espectador. The group was only able to transfer $3 million before the bank noticed what had taken place and stopped the operation. One Spaniard is among the 17 arrested, while authorities reportedly hope to detain up to 70 more suspects involved in the breach, including two Venezuelan nationals. This would have been a large heist but not the most sophisticated one. The success of the criminal operation seemed to hinge on having someone on the inside. That is but one type of cyber crime. An equally daunting threat comes from an individual or small hacker collectives that steal information by penetrating government or private systems from the outside, then selling that information on the black market. Large criminal organizations could also hire hackers to breach cyber security systems, but contrary to Hollywood depictions (like Swordfish; see video below) where violent crime and hackers mesh into a single, terrifying force, there is no real-life evidence groups like this exist yet. While it is too early to predict how the battle between cyber crime and cyber security will play out, the lure of vast sums of money via online hacking makes it the next frontier for organized crime. Cyber crime already costs the Colombian economy hundreds of millions of dollars every year, with that number set to rise as government policies are slow to respond to the rapidly changing nature of crime and security. The OAS recommends one way governments can adapt to this new security threat is by establishing a special prosecutor's office for investigating cyber crimes, which Colombia currently lacks."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Peru Criminals Set Up Phony Govt Agency to Receive Bribes. A criminal group in Peru built a phony government office to swindle contractors bidding on a public works project, although the scheme only worked because such projects have long been vehicles for bribery and corruption. By opening offices, acting as employees, and creating counterfeit emails and documents, the criminal group passed itself off as a Peruvian government agency responsible for a massive infrastructure project in the northwestern department of Piura, according to a news release by authorities. News reports differ on how much money was bilked, but anywhere from 50 to 100 contractors were taken in by the scheme. The contractors came into contact with the group after responding to ads in a Peruvian publication about bidding on contracts connected to the infrastructure project known as ""Reconstruccion con Cambios"" (Reconstruction with Changes). The project provides some 25 million soles ($7.5 million) to regions in Peru that saw damage from rains and landslides caused by the weather phenomenon, El Nino, in 2017. Using three offices rented in Piura's Chamber of Commerce building, the criminal group duped the contractors into believing they were part of the government agency behind the infrastructure project. In meetings, they offered to help the contractors fast track the documents needed to satisfy bidding requirements, such as obtaining technical licenses and finance letters. For such services, the contractors paid anywhere from 2,500 ($750) to 15,000 soles ($4,500). The fake government employees then informed contractors the winning bids would be decided by a special selection committee that required bribing. One investigator told Diario Correo that few of the contractors wanted to come forward because they feared they had committed a crime by paying out the bribe money. Authorities have since arrested 15 people from the criminal group, which authorities have dubbed ""Los Imposters de Reconstruccion"" (The Imposters of Reconstruction). The alleged mastermind, Miguel Martinez Rivera, alias ""El Ingeniero,"" or ""the Engineer,"" faces a number of charges related to organized crime, forgery, and fraud, El Comercio reported. While the creation of a phony state agency to receive bribes from contractors was a novel scheme, it was only possible because such corruption in public works contracts has long been a part of doing business in Latin America. In fact, the massive Odebrecht corruption scandal -- which revolves around the Brazilian corruption giant paying bribes to secure exclusive, multi-billion dollar government contracts for infrastructure projects -- has rocked Peru recently. Four of its former presidents have been placed under investigation for their suspected connections to the graft scheme. Forced to resign from the presidency last year, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was recently ordered into pre-trial house arrest on bribery charges stemming from Odebrecht scandal. Ollanta Humala, his predecessor, was also arrested and placed in pretrial detention on similar bribery charges, though he has since been freed. Alan Garcia, who served as Peru's president from 1985 to 1990 and 2006 to 2011, killed himself two weeks ago when police arrived at his home. And Garcia's predecessor, Alejandro Toledo, was also accused of accepting bribes. Peru's presidents, however, are hardly alone in finding themselves in hot water. A slew of political figures, lawmakers and magnates from around Latin America have been taken down by the Odebrecht investigation, known in Brazil as ""Operation Car Wash"" (""Operacao Lava Jato""). About a dozen Latin American countries with Odebrecht construction contracts are a part of the probe, which shows no sign of waning. Though egregious for its scale and the sums involved, the Odebrecht scandal is hardly an anomaly in Latin America, where bribery and kickbacks are often considered part of the cost of doing business. That makes public works contracts a magnet for white collar criminals and organized crime groups alike."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Activists Murder Highlights Environmental Threat of Organized Crime. The murder in Mexico of indigenous activist and human rights defender Isidro Baldenegro Lopez highlights the inevitablity of deadly collisions between environmental activists and organized crime across Latin America. Baldenegro Lopez was shot dead on January 15 in the Coloradas de la Virgen community in the Guadalupe and Calvo municipality of Chihuahua state. The murder quickly drew attention to collusion between drug trafficking cartels and the illegal timber industry, which Lopez was known for speaking out against. ""Tribal figures [cacicazgos] involved with the illegal timber trade and organized crime are the material and intellectual authors"" of the crime, a human rights activist told BBC Mundo under condition of anonymity as a safety measure. For years, criminal groups have used illegal logging in the region as a means of laundering the dirty money obtained from marijuana and opium poppy cultivation. According to the Proceso correspondant Patricia Mayorga, the illegal trade is not only used to generate profit from the wood sales but also to build houses for those who control the plantations and the drug trafficking, reported La Sierra. Lopez attempted to defend the Sierra Tarahumara for years. But the area where the states of Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua converge is one of the main marijuana and poppy producing regions in Mexico. This has created fertile ground for the illegal timber trade , as well as growing violence and corruption in the area. The murder of Baldenegro Lopez is the latest illustration of the uphill struggle for the protection of the Mexican environment, which has been challenged by the illegal extraction of resources and criminal groups operating in the region. One of the few success stories for environmental activism in Mexico took place in 2011 in Cheran, a town of 20,000 inhabitants in the state of Michoacan. Tired of being harassed and abused by criminal groups from the illegal timber and drug trades, the town took up arms to defend their land. But although the violence has since subsided, the community leaders that led movement are still under threat. Lopez' path followed that of his father, who was murdered in 1986 by criminals involved in illegal logging. Lopez was threatened and persecuted a number of times, and was even detained fifteen months on marijuana possession charges that were never proven. Despite the recognition from international organizations that his environmental activism brought him -- Lopez received the Goldman Prize in 2005 -- the activist's life ended brutally. Just like Berta Caceres, the Honduran environmental activist who was murdered in March 2016, Lopez has become a symbol of the frontal collision between environmental activism and organized crime. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Eco-trafficking In 2015, 66 percent of the environmental activists killed worldwide were murdered in Latin America, according to Global Witness. Brazil is particularly affected by this issue ; an estimated 80 percent of its timber trade is illegal and the country accounts for 25 percent of the illicit trade worldwide worth $30 billion. Just as in Mexico, this creates a strong criminal incentive for illegal loggers to move into rural and poor communities. According to that same non-governmental organization, there were 150 murders of Brazilian activists since 2012, making the country the most dangerous in the world for such advocates. The most recent case was that of Luis Alberto Araujo ; the government official's murder in the state of Para in 2016 showed that even prominent figures are vulnerable to such threats, not only in the Amazon but across the region."	1	0	0	1	0	1	0
"LatAm Among Deadliest Regions for Land Activists: Report. A new report documents 2015 as the worst year on record for murders of land and environmental defenders. Latin American countries were among the most dangerous for activists, in part due to the prevalence of criminal resource extraction in the region. The report ( pdf ), produced by Global Witness -- an organization that investigates environmental and human rights abuses driven by corruption and natural resource exploitation -- documented 185 killings of ""land and environmental defenders"" in 16 countries. This represents a 59 percent increase over 2014 and the largest total since 2002. Global Witness defined land and environmental defenders as ""people who take peaceful action to protect environmental or land rights."" Almost 40 percent of 2015 victims were indigenous people, who are often targeted for protecting ancestral lands. The worst affected countries were Brazil (50 killings), the Philippines (33), and Colombia (26). (See graphic) The image in the graphic is that of Berta Caceres, a Honduran environmental and indigenous activist who resisted the construction of hydroelectric dams along the Gualcarque River for over a decade. She was murdered in March 2016. In Brazil, violence was particularly concentrated in the Amazon, where agricultural interests and ""gangs of illegal loggers"" are encroaching on local communities. According to Global Witness, an estimated 80 percent of Brazilian timber is illegal, accounting for 25 percent of illegal wood on global markets. Global Witness not only blamed a rise in illegal logging in Brazil for driving deforestation, but also for violence against land and environmental defenders. In April 2015, for instance, an indigenous man from the Alto Turiacu reserve in the Brazilian Amazon was shot dead by two men on a motorbike. He had been active in leading patrols to monitor illegal logging and closing tracks used to extract timber. Mining, however, was the industry most linked to killings of land and environmental defenders, with 42 deaths in 2015. In Peru, of the 12 deaths documented by Global Witness during 2015, 11 were linked to mining and extractive industries. One case highlighted in the report was that of a Peruvian forest worker from Madre de Dios who had been resisting the incursion of illegal gold miners into the biodiverse Tambopata region. He was killed in his home in November. Since 2002, around 80 percent of the 69 killings documented by Global Witness in Peru have been linked to the mining sector. As Global Witness noted, many of the murders of land activists occur in remote regions and few perpetrators are brought to justice, often due to the indifference or active collusion of government officials. Illicit resource extraction in Latin America is a major source of revenue for criminal groups in the region. Illegal mining in Peru has been estimated to generate some $2.6 billion per year. Brazil has struggled to rein in wood trafficking, with the illegal market offering tempting opportunities for profit despite government attempts to promote sustainable timber harvesting. The illegal timber trade is worth up to $30 billion annually. As the Global Witness report indicates, those individuals and groups that seek to halt illicit resource extraction in Latin America often find themselves confronting powerful interests -- whether they are state, corporate, or criminal in nature -- putting themselves at great personal risk. Unfortunately, this not uncommonly leads to the death or disappearance of land activists, as evidence by the March 2016 murder of Berta Caceres, a Honduran indigenous woman who struggled to halt the construction of hydroelectric dams. The alleged direct authors of Caceres killing have been arrested amid massive international pressure on the Honduran government. However, questions remain about possible intellectual authors belonging to the Honduran elite. Many of cases documented by Global Witness have resulted in no arrests at all."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Can Drones be Used to Fight Eco-Trafficking in Latin America?With indigenous communities in Panama and Peru reportedly planning to use drones to monitor rainforest destruction, this raises all kinds of possibilities for how drones could be used in the future to detect environmental crimes like timber trafficking and illegal mining. The plans were discussed at the recent 2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Lima, Peru, which included the exhibition of the first images from test drone flights showing oil spills in the Peruvian Amazon, reported EFE. One specialist from Peruvian indigenous rights group Aidesep told EFE that the drones would help gather evidence of violations committed by companies working in the Amazon. Another Peruvian indigenous association told EFE they are interested in using drones to ensure that certain indigenous communities remain isolated; while representatives from Panama's Embera indigenous group said they intended to use drones to map out their territory and determine whether the area can be used to capture and store large amounts of carbon dioxide waste underground, a process known as carbon capture. The drones to be used by these indigenous groups cost $12,000 each and have a 16 kilometer flight radius, according to EFE. The fact that indigenous activists in the Amazon are already set to begin deploying drones points to a great potential for the use of these aircraft -- which have been growing in popularity in Latin America -- in monitoring illicit activity in jungle regions. Environmental crime is worth billions of dollars each year on a global scale, and involves major criminal networks. One of the current challenges faced by authorities is a lack of adequate tools to combat eco-trafficking. There is already a precedent for the use of drones in this way: in 2011, Brazil's environmental police purchased drones to track crimes like illegal fishing and deforestation in rural areas. One key advantage of drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), is that they can perform surveillance in wide swathes of territory that are not easily accessible to humans, or that are dangerous to enter. The jungles of Peru and Colombia are bastions for illegal gold mining , while areas like the Bosawas forest reserve in Nicaragua are heavily impacted by illegal timber extraction and land trafficking. Nonetheless, more extensive deployment of drones in Latin America still faces a number of complications, including inadequate domestic or international legislation regarding how they can be used. These issues would likely need to be addressed before government bodies could fly the machines in indigenous or privately owned territory.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Illegal Mining Crackdown in Timbiqui, Colombia Angers Residents. Recent raids on illegal mining operations in Timbiqui, Cauca were part of a broad crackdown on criminal economies being used by ex-FARC mafia groups, but they may only stoke anti-government resentment among the local Afro-Colombian community. On September 17, Colombian public security forces initiated a series of raids on alleged illegal mining operations within the remote villages dispersed along the Timbiqui River. But Timbiqui's residents are denouncing the tactics used by security forces. Local sources on the ground provided InSight Crime with videos of several excavators which security forces allegedly dumped into the Timbiqui River before blowing them up. ""The machinery that they burned in the middle of the river, and all the oil that spilled out, harms the environment,"" one local resident told InSight Crime. Explosion in Timbiqui River {""type"":""video"",""tracklist"":true,""tracknumbers"":true,""images"":true,""artists"":true,""tracks"":[{""src"":""https:\/\/www.insightcrime.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Explosion-Rio-Timbiqui.mp4"",""type"":""video\/mp4"",""title"":""Explosion in Timbiqu\u00ed River"",""caption"":""Security forces explode mining machinery in Timbiqu\u00ed River"",""description"":"""",""meta"":{""length_formatted"":""0:16""},""dimensions"":{""original"":{""width"":640,""height"":352},""resized"":{""width"":674,""height"":371}},""image"":{""src"":""https:\/\/www.insightcrime.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/video.png"",""width"":48,""height"":64},""thumb"":{""src"":""https:\/\/www.insightcrime.org\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/video.png"",""width"":48,""height"":64}}]} The river is the only means of travel to and from the community and locals say the debris in the waterway has severely hampered their ability to move. Additionally, they defended their local involvement in illegal mining operations, saying that there are no other job opportunities and that the state has abandoned them. ""The only source of income for people, or the majority of people, is mining,"" one resident who wished to remain anonymous told InSight Crime. ""We are pushing back because the right way is not to use force and burn the only work tools that these people have."" Community members reportedly confronted security forces peacefully, trying to defend their excavators. But Colombia's anti-riot squad (Escuadron Movil Antidisturbios -- ESMAD) was called in and several injuries were reported. Locals of Timbiqui also told InSight Crime that authorities raided the homes of several suspected dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia -- FARC), and that weapons and gold were seized. However, authorities have not confirmed this and no arrests have been announced. Initial statements by the Attorney General's Office indicated that local mining activity was being carried out by criminal structures without permits. The government later identified those responsible as belonging to the ex-FARC mafia, dissidents of the FARC's 29th Front. Dissident members of the FARC's 29th Front are not new to Timbiqui, according to General Alejandro Bustamante, director of rural security for Colombian police. He added that the group's use of mercury in its illegal gold mining activities has caused severe environmental damage. The leader of the 29 th Front dissidents has been identified as Gonzalo Prado Paz, alias ""Sabalo."" If the crackdown happened as described by residents in Timbiqui, it is clear why the government's actions may only serve to stoke sympathy for the ex-FARC mafia while doing little to hurt their mining operations. With former top FARC leaders having announced a return to arms in August, the Colombian government's crackdown is likely part of a broader campaign to cut off sources of revenue for the ex-FARC mafia. However, history has shown that isolated raids on illegal mines are unlikely to impede future mining operations and can have real long-term implications for communities if the government does not have a plan in place for displaced workers. Faced with few economic opportunities, workers often return to the dismantled mining operations. Miners attracted by the potential profits find clandestine ways to continue operating. There is also the risk that displaced workers are enticed by other illicit activities, such as coca cultivation or illegal logging. Locals and workers whose homes or equipment were destroyed by security forces are less likely to cooperate with authorities in the future. Timbiqui's remote location is strategic for armed actors. Located on Colombia's Pacific Coast, it is four hours by speedboat from the port city of Buenaventura, making it a perfect drug trafficking corridor. As there are no roads or bridges connecting Timbiqui's dispersed settlements, it can take up to two hours by speedboat to travel between the communities, making it difficult for law enforcement to control coca cultivation or illegal mining. https://www.insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Debris.mp4 At least two narco-submarines have been captured in the municipality in 2019, showing how it is also a departure point for cocaine shipments leaving Colombia. This remoteness has also made it difficult to develop any real economic programs there. Back in 2016, the Ombudsman's Office warned that mining activity conducted by armed actors would present socio-environmental challenges for Colombia's southwest Cauca department. FARC dissidents have maintained a presence in Timbiqui since the 2016 peace agreement, and their local gold mining operations are deeply entrenched ."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Large Deposit Brings Illegal Gold Rush to Ecuador. The largest gold deposit in Ecuador is in the hands of organized crime. At the end of 2017, while authorities in the northern province of Imbabura were working on the initial stages of building a road to the parish of Buenos Aires in San Miguel de Urcuqui canton, a backhoe uncovered a gold vein that experts say could be one of the continent's largest. Within 24 hours, nearly 700 people were already illegally mining the gold, Henry Troya, the then-deputy minister of mining in Ecuador, told InSight Crime. And that was just the beginning. The news of such a large deposit attracted both Ecuadoreans and foreign nationals from Colombia, Peru, Brazil and Venezuela. The number of illegal miners swelled along with other illicit economies. Troya estimates that there are now 3,000 people involved in mining in the area. Other sources whom InSight Crime consulted have put the tally at up to 10,000. Criminal structures of all kinds have set up shop: among them extortionists, mafiosos and dissident members from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). With high-powered weapons that easily surpass the capabilities of government authorities, these criminal groups control the mine, which draws up to $500,000 in illegal profits per month. The majority of miners are artisanal and small-scale, working with hand-operated machinery. Most miners convert the rock into dust and then transport it approximately 800 kilometers to Ecuador's southern province of El Oro. There, the ore is processed and legalized through companies that have already been in operation at the border with Peru. Recently, however, evidence of more sophisticated methods, including leaching pools and processing plants, have been discovered near the Buenos Aires mine in Ecuador. Five to 10 trucks travel in caravans daily, receiving up to $150,000 per trip, which the illegal organizations use to pay authorities to allow their passage. They are escorted by armed vehicles and a van, where the money is stored. A military truck is known to have been among the vehicles used to transport the mined gold. Authorities arrived in Buenos Aires towards the end of 2017 but found that they were late to the game: the miners were heavily armed and had extensive control over the area. They calculated that it would take at least five days of large-scale armed interventions and three months of patrolling for the government to regain full control of the territory. This proved untenable for authorities, who ceased their operations. A source consulted by InSight Crime said that certain political actors may be benefitting from the illegal mining. And they, of course, would not be interested in dismantling the criminal structures operating at the gold deposit. Authorities, however, did carry out one of Ecuador's largest operations against illegal mining on January 17. ""Operation Mega-Avalanche 2: Bright Dawn"" yielded six firearms, ammunition, explosives and 31 metric tons of mining material. Authorities raided 15 houses and arrested 24 people, including a Colombian national. But those arrested were released after only a few days and likely returned immediately to the mine. Although Ecuador has experienced gold rushes in the past, this level of open involvement by organized crime and armed gangs is unprecedented. Buenos Aires is the third location to witness significant illegal mining in the country's history. Two earlier instances occurred between 1970 and 1990, one of which took place in Nambija, Zamora province, and the other in a mining area in El Oro province. While mafia-like structures cropped up in both cases, the situation in Buenos Aires represents the first time that organized crime structures have been seen participating in illegal mining in Ecuador. The convergence of both illegal artisanal miners and organized crime structures -- many of whom seem more than willing to protect a potent source of income -- has simply overwhelmed authorities. What efforts the Ecuadorean government has made through the police, politicians or the Mining Regulation and Monitoring Agency (Agencia de Regulacion y Control Minero - ARCOM) are not enough to counteract the rapidly growing numbers of miners and weapons now circulating in the region. A senior Ecuadorean police official, who asked to remain anonymous, told InSight Crime that the Oliver Sinisterra Front (Frente Oliver Sinisterra - FOS) of FARC dissidents is operating in Buenos Aires. He added that the FOS may be providing funds for the mines and running extortion operations. According to the official, there are also two groups led by men known as ""Javier"" and ""Perico"" controlling territory in the area. They have been extorting everyone from the people who control mine entrances to the owners of restaurants that the miners frequent. It may be that the high profits from such activities are behind many of the disputes among the criminal groups that have descended upon Buenos Aires and are jostling for territory. Possibly in relation to the groups' conflicts, a Colombian miner was shot dead in December. Others have been killed as well. While it seems clear that there is a strong relationship between illegal mining and organized crime groups in Buenos Aires, it is not the only place in Ecuador where illegal mining has drawn criminal actors. InSight Crime has found that organizations like the FOS could be exerting influence over mining activities in the border provinces of Esmeraldas and Carchi, specifically in the parishes of San Lorenzo and Tobar Donoso. This is a sign that the dimensions of the power organized crime holds over mining in Ecuador could be much greater than previously thought."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"GameChangers 2016: Illegal Mining and Continuing Criminal Diversification. Latin America witnessed a criminal boom in illegal mining in 2016, and a rise of complementary illicit activities, as organized crime recognized the potential of illegal gold can rival the cocaine trade. Two of the main factors raised to explain the magnitude of the phenomenon were, as InSight Crime said, ""higher risks and lower profit margins in drug trafficking, and a surge in international gold prices [that] have combined to create the ideal conditions for a boom in criminal gold mining."" This expansion is causing environmental and human damage in the affected countries. The highest estimated proportion of illegal mining within national industries is believed to be in Venezuela (90 percent) and Colombia (70 percent), while illegal mining in Peru and could reach 28 percent and 9 percent respectively. Illegal mining has grown into an attractive and lucrative business for organize crime, not only due to the associated economic gains and minimal judicial risks, but also because of its facilitating role in money laundering schemes. In Colombia, criminal groups view illegal gold as a window of opportunity with very few restrictions. It is carried out in areas with low institutional presence, and much of the state's efforts -- as with drug trafficking -- are concentrated on the lower levels of the production chain, namely informal miners and machinery, rather than addressing the legal global market flooded by ""blood"" gold. As in most of the countries affected by this activity, Panama and Mexico have witnessed the evolution of illegal mining into an efficient mechanism to launder criminal proceeds by both, as we wrote, foreign and domestic criminal structures : ""The origins of melted gold are difficult to trace, and US companies that deal with gold face less scrutiny than institutions that handle cash transfers."" Criminal Groups and Their Portfolios Criminal groups are involved in different components of the illegal mining industry, depending on the territory in which they are established. In some cases, such as in Venezuela, they only charge extortion fees from communities or multinational companies involved in the industry. But in other countries, like Colombia, criminal elements control the whole process. The organized crime groups regulate the trade , manage the security as well as the machinery, and give permits to ""barqueos"" -- individual autonomous miners without machines or equipment -- to carry out mining activities. And at the most sophisticated stage, they use illegal mining as a money laundering method. Although the potential profits may vary from one country to another, the economic gains generated by illegal mining are significant. Peru's Madre de Dios state, which has been dramatically affected by the illegal gold mining, is believed to have generated more than a billion dollars of illicit profits since 2011, a trend which is reportedly still increasing. In Colombia, as we wrote , the illegal gold industry as a whole ""brings in an estimated three billion dollars every year, more than double the earnings of the illicit drug trade -- [and] has reportedly attracted the attention of foreign illegal armed groups, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC)."" The industry has had an effect on the murder rate, human trafficking , forced labor and other illicit activities that undergo a correlated increase due the wide criminal networks generated by illegal mining. ""Illicit mining operations often fuel a number of separate but related criminal activities."" ""Illicit mining operations often fuel a number of separate but related criminal activities,"" we reported. ""One of the most common crimes linked to illegal mining is human trafficking, which can serve to supply forced labor at the illicit mining sites as well as prostitution rings, where paid workers can spend their money."" In the case of Colombia, the majority of gold deposits are located in the Pacific region, Antioquia, Cordoba and Bolivar. Illegal mining generates billions of dollars a year in the country, which explains why several criminal actors have invested in the sector. ""Mining is a key source of income for Colombia's guerrilla organizations and neo-paramilitary groups, known as BACRIM (from the Spanish 'bandas criminales'),"" we said. ""These groups manage, extort and provide security for illegal mining operations. The departments with the most gold depositsare also some of the country's most violent, with a heavy presence of armed actors."" The FARC's 57th Front has become the de facto regulator of gold exploitation in the border region of Panama's Darien province and the Colombian department of Choco. Other fronts of the group, as well as the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN), participate in this activity, although to a lesser extent. Illegal armed groups often charge to allow the entry of dredgers and other mining equipment, maintaining their control by extorting ""barqueos"" who enter territory under their influence to carry out gold mining activities. Mexico's illegal gold exports have been estimated at $500 million and, as InSight Crime reported, "" mining in five different states -- Chihuahua, Guerrero, Michoacan, Morelos, and Tamaulipas -- is controlled by criminal groups."" Organizations in these areas, such the Zetas or the Knights Templar, extort local and multinational mining operators in exchange for allowing them to carry out their work unmolested in these zones. There are also allegations that illegal mining fosters corruption and violence. One of the most serious cases reportedly occurred in the Venezuelan state of Bolivar. ""A Venezuela party leader has blamed corruption in the armed forces for the disappearance of 28 miners, hinting at long-standing military involvement in the illegal gold industry,"" we reported. ""He also asserted that military officials present in the area charge illegal miners extortion fees in exchange for allowing them to operate."" Gold Trade and Money Laundering A common pattern related to illegal mining in all five of the aforementioned Latin American countries is the use by organized crime of the illegal gold trade to launder illegal proceeds. In Peru, a variety of criminal elements participating in illegal mining have emerged, and their involvement in the commercialization of gold has come to affect neighboring Ecuador and Bolivia. ""An investigation in Ecuador has revealed how the country has become a major transit hub for illegal Peruvian gold exported to the United States, an evolution directly linked to Peru's attempts to crack down on gold trafficking,"" InSight Crime wrote. Tackling this transnational flux of illegal gold has proven particularly complicated for both states and private companies. ""A major difficulty in tackling the illegal gold trade stems from the challenge of proving when legal business entities are knowingly or negligently dealing with black market product,"" we said. ""Gold importers are normally required to ensure their purchases come from legitimate sources, but proof of origin documentation can be falsified, allowing illegally-mined gold to enter the legitimate market."" These cross-border dynamics facilitating money laundering activities have been witnessed throughout the region, as ""gold trading in Panama has long been a favored laundering method for Colombian criminals,"" such as the Urabenos. ""A major difficulty in tackling the illegal gold trade stems from the challenge of proving when legal business entities are knowingly or negligently dealing with black market product."" According to a study by Colombia's Externado University released this year , in Colombia ""the main issues with illegal mining are financial, since illegally extracted minerals cannot be taxed,"" which makes it not only easy to trade gold but also to launder money. Organized crime also takes advantage of the legal gold trade to launder its criminal profits, as illustrated by a report by Bloomberg concerning a 2014 US operation against a Sinaloa Cartel laundering scheme. ""Sinaloa Cartel operatives based in Chicago would use profits from drug sales to buy gold bars and jewelry in the area. The gold was then shipped via FedEx to a company in Florida, which melted down the gold and sold it for cash. The Florida company would then keep one percent of the profits and send the rest of the money to a business in Mexico,"" we said referring to the Bloomberg report. ""Operatives involved in the scheme would also falsify paperwork, making it look as though the Mexican business had legitimately sold the gold to their partners in Florida. Members of the Sinaloa Cartel sent hundreds of boxes full of gold to the Florida company before US authorities raided the company's office outside of Miami."" Considerable economic gains associated with mining have led criminal groups to exert pressure on the general population with the objective of gaining control of the activity. The growth of illegal mining increases the risk of criminal groups partaking in other illicit activities, such as sexual exploitation, forced labor and timber trafficking. Persons under the legal age are regularly used or recruited to work in activities linked with illegal mining. In Colombia, girls have been taken for, as we reported , the sexual entertainment of miners. ""Sex trafficking in the Americas is most concentrated in the gold mines of Peru and Colombia, according to the report, in part due to the involvement of organized crime groups in the mining industry which operates in remote regions of those countries,"" InSight Crime said. And, in addition to human rights concerns, the illegal mining industry has proven to have detrimental effects on rivers and forests that are contaminated daily with chemicals such as mercury and other waste. Regardless of fluctuations in gold prices, illegal mining will continue to offer significant benefits to criminal groups wishing to diversify and solidify their source of income. It has become a catalyst for an array of illicit activities -- prostitution, forced labor and eco-trafficking -- and presents a low risk due to a weak state response and presence in the areas where mining is occurring."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Peru Launches Dual Strategy to Tackle Illegal Mining Boom. Peru's government is targeting the illegal gold trade by declaring illegal mining an organized crime activity while launching a new formalization program for miners, in a carrot and stick strategy that history suggests will be difficult to implement. Justice and Human Rights Minister Marisol Perez Tello has told Peruvian press that illegal mining, along with related activities including the trafficking of equipment and substances used in mining and the financing of illegal mining, are to be incorporated into the country's Organized Crime Law, reported El Peruano. The decision will mean authorities can now investigate a case while the accused is detained for up to 36 months and grants extra powers to investigators such as the use of undercover agents. In addition, Energy and Mines Minister Gonzalo Tamayo announced the launch of a new plan for the formalization of miners. The government's aim is to formalize half of the estimated 100,000-120,000 illegal miners in the country, reported El Comercio. The new plan will seek to simplify the procedures required to formalize and incentivize miners by offering credit and facilitating the granting of mining titles. According to the minister, the government will differentiate between illegal miners and informal miners who can be brought into the legal economy by determining which operate in areas where mining is prohibited and which just lack proper authorization and permits. Disentangling informal and illegal mining is one of the greatest challenges governments such as Peru's face when it comes to tackling the illegal mining boom that has ravaged parts of Latin America in recent years. Indiscriminate operations that criminalize all mining that is not legal puts the livelihoods of thousands of people and the economic future of mining territories at risk. However, the infiltration and co-optation of informal mining by criminal networks makes drawing a neat line between the criminal and the informal extremely difficult. Tackling the issue from both sides -- cracking down on the illegal while seeking to formalize the informal -- is a strategy countries impacted by illegal mining are now settling on as the best way to address this situation. However, such attempts are not new for Peru, and their prior record is not good. The previous formalization campaign saw approximately 70,000 miners sign up to be integrated into the legal mining industry. However, several years later, only 161 mining operations representing approximately 3,000 people have completed the process, El Peruano cited Tamayo as saying.	0	0	1	0	0	1	0
"Expert Says 88% of Colombias Gold Produced Illegally. The vast majority of gold in Colombia's mines is extracted illegally, according to one expert, underscoring the importance of this illegal economy as the country prepares for a new chapter in its criminal history. Eighty-eight percent of the 57 metric tons of gold that are mined each year in Colombia are produced illegally, the president of the Colombian Mining Association (Asociacion Colombiana de Mineria - ACM) Santiago Angel Urdinola said at a recent press conference. Urdinola said that the departments with the highest percentage of illegally mined gold are Choco, Cauca and Valle del Cauca on the Pacific coast, as well as Antioquia and Caldas, RCN Radio reported. The ACM president said that although there were no official figures on the profits generated from illegal mining, he believes that they are ""astronomical."" These activities do not pay taxes to the state and do not comply with environmental regulations, he added. Urdinola also expressed hope that the national government would quickly finalize a new bill that aims to tighten controls on illegal gold extraction and remove the judicial ambiguities within the industry. ""The illegal industry has been growing, in part due to the lack of controls,"" Uridinola said. The Colombian news outlet Portafolio, citing ACM and government figures, reported in June that only 18 percent of all the gold produced and exported in Colombia last year was done using official mining titles. Much of the illicit gold enters the legal market in Antioquia and Valle del Cauca and is worth around $2.3 billion per year, according to Portafolio. The recent statistics on illegal gold mining demonstrate how pivotal this criminal industry is to Colombia's organized criminal landscape, which may grow in importance in the near future. Mining is a key source of income for Colombia's guerrilla organizations and neo-paramilitary groups, known as BACRIM (from the Spanish ""bandas criminales""). These groups manage , extort and provide security for illegal mining operations. The departments with the most gold deposits -- which include Choco, Antioquia, Cordoba, Bolivar and Cauca -- are also some of the country's most violent , with a heavy presence of armed actors. Indeed, in departments such as Choco, gold is potentially a bigger source of criminal revenue than coca crops, the main ingredient for cocaine. This balance is in constant flux. As global gold prices ebb and flow, so too does the mineral's role in Colombia's illegal economy. By 2012, surging gold prices helped it become the main source of earnings for criminal groups in around a quarter of Colombia's 32 departments. The value of gold then plummeted , and coca cultivation has since experienced a resurgence, reaching its highest levels in years. Given this trend, the recent rise in the value of gold -- apparently brought on by the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union -- is worrying. Colombia's criminal underworld is already experiencing a deep shift in power with the looming prospect of a guerrilla demobilization by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), which controls a large portion of the country's coca fields and illegal mines. These mineral deposits promise to attract rival armed actors looking to fill the void left by the guerrillas if and when they sign a peace deal with the Colombian government."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Venezuela Investigates Police in Miner Massacre. Venezuela's investigative police has launched an internal investigation into the recent murder of 17 gold miners, in a case that has become the center of a political war between the socialist government and the opposition. The director of Venezuela's investigative police force (Cuerpo de Investigaciones Cientificas, Penales y Criminalisticas - CICPC), Douglas Rico, stated that a number of local officers will be dismissed as part of the case, while the Attorney General's Office may also initiate its own investigations against the military and police, reported the Associated Press. On March 14, authorities discovered the bodies of 17 miners in a mass grave in the southeastern state of Bolivar, of which 14 have been fully identified. The victims had reportedly been executed, most of them with bullets to the head. According to witness testimony , a group of 60 armed individuals -- some of whom were dressed as civilians while others wore uniforms belonging to Venezuela's Bolivarian Intelligence Service (Servicio Bolivariano de Inteligencia Nacional - SEBIN) and the CICPC -- participated in the miners' disappearance. They were allegedly following the instructions of the criminal gang leader identified as being responsible for the disappearances, Ecuadorian national Jamilton Andres Ulloa Suarez , alias ""El Topo."" Authorities have made at least one arrest in the case and are searching for three suspects, including El Topo. The massacre of the miners has inflamed already tense relations between the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro and the opposition-led National Assembly. Various conflicting theories have emerged surrounding the mass disappearance. On the one hand, Maduro's administration has speculated that the miners may have been victims of a ""gang war massacre"" perpetrated by El Topo and his henchmen, who government officials say has links to the demobilized Colombian paramilitary organization United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC). Opposition politicians, on the other hand, have pointed fingers at the military , flagging up the armed forces' long-standing collusion with criminal groups in the area. Congressman Americo de Grazia recently claimed that he was receiving death threats after denouncing the disappearances. The congressman has also suggested that the disappearances are the result of a government ""cleansing"" in the area in order to allow multinational gold mining companies to enter the region. Both versions of events have their plausible aspects. Four criminal gangs reportedly operate in Bolivar, where violent clashes related to the mining trade are frequent. Locals have also suggested that a turf dispute was behind this most recent massacre. Security forces, meanwhile, have reportedly colluded with criminal groups in the past to extort miners and run protection rackets in Bolivar. While the truth remains out of reach for now, the politicization of this case threatens to overshadow the more fundamental dynamics at work, which are the increasing sophistication of organized crime in Venezuela, and the government's failures to address this phenomenon."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Crime Ring Laundered $1 Billion in Colombia Gold Exports. Colombia's Attorney General's Office announced the results of an investigation involving an illegal network that had allegedly laundered $1 billion through gold sales, in a case revealing how criminals use gold exports to disguise dirty cash. In a press release , Colombia's assistant attorney general called it ""the most important"" blow yet against money laundering networks that rely on gold. The two-year investigation centered on gold export company Goldex, and its owner John Uber Hernandez Santa. El Tiempo reported that the Attorney General's Office issued 26 arrest warrants for people linked to Goldex, including one for Hernandez. The company is accused of using fake gold sales to launder some 2.3 billion pesos (just over $1 billion), according to the Attorney General's Office , and was reportedly spread across at least five departments in Colombia. Investigators found that many of the 6,000 alleged providers of gold to Goldex didn't exist, or were registered in the names of people now deceased, according to El Tiempo. Hernandez has admitted to buying gold from companies linked to the founder of Colombia's largest criminal group, the Urabenos. In another strange twist to the case, one man under investigation recently killed himself in the Medellin Palace of Justice by throwing himself off the building. He jumped from the same floor where the courtroom hearing the case was located, according to Caracol Radio. Following a previous article published by InSight Crime about the Goldex case, Hernandez -- via a public relations company hired by Goldex at the time -- sent InSight Crime two letters ( one in English and Spanish ), arguing that the company was not guilty of any wrongdoing. InSight Crime attempted to contact Hernandez via the public relations company, but the company stopped working for Goldex on September 30, 2014, after Goldex ceased operations. The investigation into Goldex comes as another indication that Colombia continues to confront the intersection between gold, illegal mining, and organized crime. The country recently announced a new series of legal reforms meant to tackle the problem of illegal gold mining, but as InSight Crime previously reported , these measures may be too little too late. Criminal networks have long used the gold industry as a way to launder dirty cash and to fund operations in Colombia. The security forces have previously said that criminal groups are thought to be involved in illegal mining in nearly half of Colombia's municipalities. Colombia is not the only country where there are prominent links between gold, illegal mining, and money laundering. There have been reports of Mexican gangs stealing gold , intending to use it as a way to launder cash, while in Peru, money laundering via illegal mining reportedly increased 50 percent between 2012 and 2014."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Criminal Onslaught Sees Mexico Mining Companies Take to the Skies. Mining companies in Mexico are now using aircraft to move their products and personnel and ramping up investment in security in order to avoid being robbed and extorted by organized crime, in the latest sign criminal groups are increasingly diversifying into Mexico's mining industry. Jesus Herrera Ortega, a member of the Association of Mining Engineers, Metallurgists, and Geologists of Mexico, told Excelsior that due to harassment by organized crime they are using planes and helicopters to move their personnel and mineral products. Ortega said that criminals ""rob the minerals, threaten the companies in exchange for their safety, and rob trailers loaded [with zinc and lead]."" Ortega says that despite paying for increased security patrols and GPS systems to track shipments, the assaults continue. In 2013, companies affiliated with the Mexico Chamber of Mining (Camimex) spent a total of roughly $41 million dollars on private security -- a 14% increase from 2012, reported Excelsior. Camimex's annual report noted how mining is one of the most vulnerable industrial sectors to armed robbery, given operations are generally located in isolated areas with limited access. Mines in Durango, Zacatecas, Michoacan, and Coahuila, have been most affected, and for several months now mining companies have been using air transport to move minerals, diesel fuel, and personnel to avoid the risk of being assaulted. Organized crime groups in Mexico have been moving in on the mining sector for some time as they seek to diversify their revenue streams and look for sources of income beyond drug trafficking. In 2012, the Zetas, the Gulf Cartel and the Knights Templar were identified as the organizations most involved in the sector. The sort of extortion and robbery that has caused mining companies to increase their security precautions remains the mainstay of criminal groups' activities in the mining sector. However, there have also been reports that some groups are running their own small scale mining operations , while others are using minerals to launder money. Although the level of criminal involvement in mining in Mexico appears to be on the rise, it still has some way to go before it reaches the levels seen in Colombia, where mining has replaced the drug trade as the primary source of income for criminal groups in some regions, and high ranking police have identified it as the biggest security challenge facing the country."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Ecuador Cracks Down on Illegal Gold Mines. Ecuador's military carried out a operation to shut down illegal goldmines in the northwest of the country, close to the border with Colombia. On Saturday President Rafael Correa declared a state of exception in the cantons of San Lorenzo and El Alfaro, sending the military to shut down illegal mines and destroy their equipment. It is estimated that in these cantons there are more than 120 such gold mines. The operation resulted in at least three injuries, reports El Comercio. According to Security Minister Homero Arellano, the purpose of the operation was to defend the local population from environmental damage caused by illegal mining techniques. Illegal mining is a source of concern for the Ecuadorian government. There have multiple clashes between miners and law enforcement. Neighboring Colombia has seen proceeds from illegal mining going to drug-trafficking organizations such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ). See InSight's map of the criminal interests around illegal gold mining in Antioquia. In 2010 President Rafael Correa said he would continue operations against clandestine mining, saying ""We will not let our country fall into the same situation as other countries where there are extensive territories that are not under state control but under the control of illegal activities.""

Brazils Port of Natal New Link in Netherlands Cocaine Chain. Authorities have revealed a new cocaine trafficking route from a Brazil shipping port to the Netherlands, confirming that the small European country is now a preferred receiving destination for the drug from across Latin America. In February, Brazilian authorities seized 3.3 tons of cocaine in two separate shipments of tropical fruits at the port of Natal, the first seizures of this kind at Brazil's easternmost port, globo.com reported. Both shipping containers were headed to Rotterdam. During the past four months, authorities in Rotterdam have discovered seven tons of cocaine in shipments all coming from the same Brazilian port. The ten tons of drugs seized in just four months equaled more than half of the 18 tons of cocaine apprehended throughout 2018 at the port of Santos, Brazil's largest, Tribuna do Norte reported. The quantities involved point to the port of Natal, which opened in 1932, becoming a major exit point for drugs from Brazil, with the Netherlands as the intended destination. Reaction from the French shipping giant, CMA CGM Group, which is the only company exporting fruit from the port, has been swift, with the company suspending its activities in Natal and rerouting its exports through the nearby port of Fortaleza. Authorities have launched a three-month investigation and have requested a new container scanner, which the port previously lacked. The absence of such equipment has been blamed for the ease with which criminal groups were using Natal to export their drug shipments. The seizures in the Netherlands and Brazil have shown a similar modus operandi : cocaine packets camouflaged among fruit boxes. But a chemical analysis of the cocaine revealed that it came from three separate countries: Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. This hints that the criminal groups involved are receiving cocaine from various sources, combining it, and packaging it to send to the Netherlands. The uncovering of the cocaine pipeline to the Netherlands via the port of Natal indicates that drug smugglers are increasingly targeting the European nation. In recent months, the Netherlands has seen record drug seizures, along with neighboring Belgium. Record cocaine production in Colombia and a growing market for the drug in Europe are likely the reasons criminal groups are seeking new routes to the continent. What makes the port of Natal particularly useful to drug smugglers is its relative proximity to Europe -- extending far into the Atlantic -- and its lack of security infrastructure. Since 2009 Brazil has been the main outlet for South American cocaine destined for Europe, according to the United Nations on Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). From Brazil, traffickers coordinate with European criminal organizations to receive and distribute the drug. For example, in December, Interpol busted a large drug trafficking ring involving Italy's 'Ndrangheta mafia, which smuggled loads of cocaine as large as 200 kilograms from Brazil, Guyana, and Colombia into Rotterdam and Antwerp. Drug smugglers clearly have identified the Netherlands as a destination of choice, and fruit coming through Natal have made for the perfect hiding place.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Smuggling of Drugs, People Spurs Violence in Argentina Contraband Hotbed. Recent media reports point to the rise of drug and human trafficking on the Bolivia-Argentina border as the cause of spiking violence among local smugglers. An apparent revenge killing linked to drug trafficking in Argentina's Salta province has provided the latest evidence that the growing flow of drugs and unauthorized migrants from Bolivia into Argentina has fueled violence in the region, according to La Nacion. Raul ""Coya"" Martinez, a suspected trafficker, was killed on May 6 in Oran, a city in Salta province on the country's northwest border with Bolivia. His murder appears to have served as retaliation for the gunning down of rival smuggler Adrian Ricardo Geronimo on April 29 in the context of an apparent turf war unfolding between their respective trafficking groups, according to both La Nacion and El Tribuno. This area of the Salta province has long served as a major contraband gateway into Argentina, and as many as 5,000 inhabitants of the two towns are thought be working as ""bagayeros,"" the local term used to describe smugglers. Oran prosecutor Jose Luis Bruno told La Nacion that an estimated 30 percent of the local population lives off the contraband business, which has boomed in recent years. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Contraband But while the smuggling activities cover an array of products, the more recent increase in smuggling drugs and individuals -- particularly Chinese citizens -- into Argentina appears to have led to the creation of structured criminal groups that a judicial source described to La Nacion as ""mafias."" These organizations now resort to violence in an attempt to assert their control over important territory and routes, authorities said. And due to armed robberies and past confrontations between rival smugglers in the area, a local bagayero said that convoys of smuggled goods are now protected by armed members of criminal groups, La Nacion reported. Argentine officials said that they will tackle the contraband issue and close down 25 illegal border crossings. But as pointed out by La Nacion, this task may be complicated by the high proportion of the local population living off the illicit activity and the limited resources of local authorities. According to the news outlet, the government had typically turned a blind eye to contraband in the area until the recent spike in violence. The recent violence in Salta province provides further evidence that a shift toward greater involvement in drug and human smuggling by local organizations has appeared to contribute to increasing violence in the Argentine border region. Salta has long been a gateway for smuggling Bolivian cocaine into Argentina, which is both an important consumer of the drug as well as a transshipment point for its further international distribution. The province is home to the Route 34 highway, which starts at the Bolivian border and winds its way south to Argentina's three most important urban centers: Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Rosario. The highway has previously been dubbed the country's ""White Road"" of cocaine smuggling. Illegal drug smuggling, particularly from Bolivia, has been on the rise in recent years. As InSight Crime has previously reported , official sources suggest the amount of contraband flowing through the area where the recent murders took place rose by 200 percent between 2006 and 2012. And as cocaine seizures have grown in Argentina, Clarin reports , Salta has emerged as the province where the most busts have been made in recent years. Similarly, there are indications of increased human smuggling in the region. Local authorities claim that the rise in smuggling of humans and drugs in the Argentine border region has led to increased violence, but official statistical data backing this assertion is scarce. Nevertheless, there are several reasons why this theory makes sense. The illicit markets for human and drug smuggling tend to be more lucrative and more competitive than other forms of contraband, meaning crime groups may be more willing to use violence to establish control in such cases. Also, the large amounts of money to be made in these illegal activities may have fed the coffers of local crime groups, allowing them to ramp up recruitment and secure more powerful weapons, which may also be contributing to their growing willingness to use violence to further their business interests."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
Brazil Dismantles Military Police-led Contraband Ring. A special task force on public corruption has arrested eight military police accused of participation in a smuggling ring in Matto Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, two states on Brazil's western border with Paraguay and Bolivia. The task force detained three suspects in the state's capital, Campo Grande, and five more in Sidrolandia, southwest of the capital. The suspects are accused of accepting bribes in exchange for allowing contraband to be smuggled across the border from Paraguay. The task force's investigation continues, with warrants issued to conduct searches of the suspects' personal property and to detain other individuals that are still at large involved in the smuggling ring. In a separate operation, Brazil's federal police seized 370 boxes of illegal cigarettes (see photo above) worth approximately $400,000 dollars after the boat filled with contraband landed on the shore of Itaipu Lake in neighboring Parana state, which also shares a border with Paraguay. Police arrested the 26-year old Paraguayan pilot of the boat. Parana's governor revealed a border security strategy to crack down on smuggling networks operating in the state in September, part of a larger national strategy to fight drug and contraband trafficking across Brazil's borders. 	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
"Northern Brazil Prison Massacre Suggests Shifting Criminal Dynamics. A gruesome prison massacre in northern Brazil has raised serious questions about potential shifts in criminal alliances in a highly strategic region of this South American nation. As many as 57 inmates were killed in the worst prison massacre recorded so far in 2019 after fighting broke out between rival criminals gangs at the Altamira prison in Brazil's northern Para state on July 29, the country's Justice and Public Security Ministry announced in a press release. A local gang identified as the Class A Command (Comando Classe A -- CCA) reportedly stormed a wing of the prison controlled by rivals in the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) as part of a broader war over control of the lucrative drug trade in Brazil's Amazon. Gang members set fire to mattresses and decapitated at least 16 prisoners, according to local reports. The prison riot was a ""settling of scores between the two factions,"" Para's prison director Jarbas Vasconcelos told local reporters from Agencia Para. He added that his team ""had no [prior] information about an attack of this magnitude."" However, Carlos Andre Costa, the deputy secretary of intelligence and criminal analysis in Para, told Folha de Sao Paulo that authorities had obtained intelligence earlier in the month indicating that outside elements of the Red Command were driving south into areas controlled by the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC) in Para, suggesting that a potential war was brewing. The CCA's involvement in the massacre stems from its apparent alliance with the much more powerful PCC. The lesser known CCA was formed in 2013 by Oziel Barbosa, a drug dealer who went by the alias ""Maranhao,"" according to Epoca Magazine. Barbosa was later killed in 2016 , but the CCA has reportedly remained strong within Para's prison system. Following the massacre, authorities transferred 46 prisoners accused of partaking in the carnage. Ten prisoners were taken to federal facilities outside of Para, while the remaining 36 will be redistributed to other prisons within the state. This isn't the first deadly slaughter linked to warring criminal gangs to rock Brazil's prison system. A 2017 New Year's Day massacre in the Amazon city of Manaus left 56 inmates dead. The fight was linked to a feud between the Family of the North (Familia do Norte - FDN) and the PCC over the Amazon region's drug trade. Another 33 prisoners were killed four days later in retaliation during a prison riot in neighboring Roraima state. The sheer scale of mass incarceration in Brazil facilitates such gang violence. As of the end of June 2018, Para state's 47 prisons held about 16,500 prisoners, despite only having the capacity to hold around 8,600 inmates, according to official Susipe data. More than 340 prisoners were housed at Altamira prison at the time of the massacre, double its capacity of just 163 inmates, according to Folha de Sao Paulo. The Sao Paulo-based PCC, one of Brazil's most formidable criminal groups alongside the Rio de Janeiro-based Red Command, has in recent years expanded into Brazil's northern Amazon region using extreme violence, with the goal of controlling the highly profitable drug trade there. The latest prison massacre appears to be linked to these efforts. After the collapse in early 2017 of a longstanding truce between the PCC and Red Command, the PCC reportedly joined forces with the Guardians of the State (Guardioes do Estado - GDE) while the Red Command allied itself with the Family of the North, both smaller criminal organizations operating in Brazil's prized northern region. However, these alliances appear to have cracked. Since then, the CCA has allied itself with the PCC, according to reports from Folha de Sao Paulo. In Para, however, the Red Command and PCC reportedly had a tacit non-aggression agreement up until earlier this year. The Red Command controlled the city of Belem and cocaine trafficking routes coming into Brazil from Colombia and Peru along the Amazon river, while the PCC controlled Para's interior. Yet when the Red Command started moving south into areas under the PCC's control , the latter clearly wanted to send a message in the form of the prison massacre. What's more, a video obtained by authorities earlier this year showed two suspected Red Command leaders murdering a rival PCC leader in a small Para town, hinting that an underlying war was taking shape. ""This [Para state] is ours, all of it,"" the Red Command members said. Northern Para state is home to the port city of Belem, one of the main smuggling routes used for cocaine coming into Brazil from Peru and Colombia -- two of the world's top producers of the drug. The cocaine is partly destined for drug sales in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, where Brazil has a booming consumer market. The recent prison massacre is likely ""part of the larger scramble for control of Brazil's north and northeast,"" according to Benjamin Lessing, a professor at the University of Chicago who examines organized crime in Brazil. ""The CCA took an opportunity to strike against the Red Command in a brutal way that suggests it is trying to intimidate rivals and establish its bona fides,"" Lessing told InSight Crime. ""Several unverified reports suggest [the CCA] has become an ally of the PCC, so it may have acted at the PCC's urging, or as a way of getting in good with the PCC."""	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Bolivia Minister Sticks to Party Line on Foreign Cartel Presence. Bolivia's interior minister said emissaries of Brazilian and Colombian drug trafficking groups are operating within the Andean nation, but the scope of foreign participation in the country's drug trade could be greater than the minister admits. Interior Minister Carlos Romero said ""emissaries"" of the Brazilian prison gangs Red Command (Comando Vermelho) and First Capital Command ( Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC) are operating in the country, reported El Deber. He also stated there have been examples of Colombian drug trafficking groups sending envoys to Bolivia. ""Cartels do not operate in Bolivia like [they do] in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico,"" Romero said. ""We are a transit nation. While it's true there aren't cartels, there are emissaries who can make transactions, that we don't deny."" The minister added he has seen no evidence of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel operating in the country. Those comments were in response to recent reporting by Spanish journalist David Beriain, who said incarcerated Sinaloa boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman bought cocaine in Bolivia for $2,500 per kilogram and resold it in Mexico for $17,000 per kilogram. ""We are very interested to know more about the Spanish journalist's version, to see how serious it is and also to analyze if it has elements that we could investigate,"" Romero said. Romero's comments hew to the long-held official narrative that foreign emissaries, but not cartels, are active in Bolivia. Security officials have been careful to make this distinction since at least as far back as 2012. In 2014, Bolivia's top anti-drug official at the time told InSight Crime that foreign ""emissaries have ties with criminal clans"" in the country, but stopped short of saying transnational organized crime had taken root. There are, however, indications that foreign drug trafficking groups have a more permanent presence in Bolivia than the party line would suggest. In July 2014, police in Santa Cruz arrested a Colombian accused of establishing an ""oficina de cobro,"" a criminal structure that has its roots in Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel. The large number of suspects from Colombia -- and of other nationalities as well -- captured during drug raids also points to a sustained foreign presence in Bolivia. The statements by Romero and others could be an attempt to downplay Bolivia's role in South America's drug trade. The Andean nation is both a producer and transit nation for cocaine heading to Brazil, the world's second largest market for the drug. Bolivia also shares borders with the region's largest producer of marijuana, Paraguay, and two of its top consumers, Argentina and Chile."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Sophisticated Argentina Kidnapping Gang Allegedly Includes Fmr Shining Path Guerrillas. Investigators in Argentina believe police officers and former members of Peru's Shining Path guerrillas are behind the recent kidnapping of a wealthy businessman, raising concerns that the country's kidnapping groups may be growing more sophisticated. According to an investigator cited by La Nacion , a criminal group composed of former members of the Shining Path and current and former police officers was responsible for kidnapping Daniel Rebagliati, the owner of an environmental cleanup company. Rebagliati was kidnapped on April 28 and released on May 6, ending eight days of captivity in what he described as very poor conditions, after his family reportedly paid a ransom of around $200,000 dollars, reported Clarin. The kidnapping was unusual because it did not follow the typical pattern of ""express"" kidnappings in Argentina, in which victims are only held for a few hours in vehicles and are forced to empty their bank accounts. The kidnappers in Rebagliati's case took special measures to ensure their anonymity, moved him to several different sites during his captivity, and forced him to remain barefoot so that traces of the places he was housed would not remain on his shoes, according to Clarin. The kidnappers also had Rebagliati's family throw the ransom from a moving train, and even carried out a trial run of the ransom hand-off the day before to ensure that they weren't being followed by security forces. Investigators told local media that they believe the same criminal group may have carried out other recent kidnappings as well, including the kidnapping of a businessman who was taken captive two weeks before Rebagliati. Although kidnappings appear to be on the rise in Argentina , they are typically ""express"" kidnappings, which are often unplanned and start out as vehicle robberies, only becoming kidnappings if the driver is perceived as being wealthy. However, the alleged involvement of police and ex-guerrillas in the most recent kidnapping, and the tactics they employed, indicate that this crime has seen the rise of more sophisticated criminal groups as well. The alleged role of former Shining Path guerrillas is also notable. In March, an investigation carried out by an Argentine NGO found that former Shining Path guerrillas were involved in the operation of at least 10 cocaine laboratories in Buenos Aires. In addition, in 2013 a Shining Path member wanted for the murder of two police officers in Peru was arrested in the same city. As Argentina's role in the drug trade has grown, the country has seen the arrival of members of foreign criminal groups from across the region."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Bolivia Steps Up Fight Against Drugs in Amazon. Bolivia's anti-drug task force has increased security operations to combat the growing presence of drug trafficking groups in the Amazon, a neglected but hugely strategic area for organized crime, not only in Bolivia, but also Peru, Brazil and Colombia. At a press conference on October 14, the head of Bolivia's Anti-Drug Trafficking Task Force (FELCN), Mario Centellas, revealed that security forces have intensified interdiction efforts in the Amazon region, destroying laboratories and seizing airplanes used to transport drugs, reported El Diario. He told reporters that the region's topography and lack of accessibility have facilitated drug trafficking and production. As an example, Centellas cited a FELCN operation on October 12 that resulted in the seizure of a drug plane and 102 kilos of cocaine in the department of Beni, which is part of Bolivia's Amazon basin. Four individuals were arrested during the operation, including one Brazilian, one Peruvian, and one Paraguayan. The cocaine seized in the operation had been imported from Peru and was apparently due to be transported to Paraguay, Brazil, and Europe, reported La Prensa. FELCN's increased focus on the Amazon echoes similar security measures in other countries that have seen a growing organized crime threat in the Amazon region. In September, Peru declared a state of emergency in two Amazon districts to combat the rising level of drug trafficking in the jungle region. Later that month, the presidents of Colombia and Peru signed an agreement to strengthen security efforts in the Amazon to fight drug trafficking and illegal mining along their shared frontier. Brazil has also previously deployed large numbers of troops to the Amazon in order to crack down on criminal activity. The recent seizure in Beni highlights Bolivia's role as a drug transit hub in South America's emerging drug trafficking dynamic. As reported in InSight Crime's special series on Bolivian drug trafficking , increased security efforts in Colombia have pushed criminal organizations to migrate their operations to Bolivia, which lacks radars and other resources needed for interdiction. Field research conducted by InSight Crime revealed that large quantities of coca base are transported from Peru to Bolivia, where the substance is processed in cocaine laboratories run by Colombian drug trafficking groups before being shipped to Brazil -- home to the world's second largest consumer drug market .	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Ecuador Arms Trafficking Ring More Complex Than Previously Thought. Organized crime structures are known to be moving entire arsenals from Peru into Ecuador and on to armed groups within Colombia. However, the full details about the origins of these weapons and the specific criminal organizations receiving them remain unknown. On February 13, Ecuadorean authorities carried out an operation in the cities of Quito and Riobamba, dismantling an international arms trafficking network that transported, stored and distributed weapons and ammunition from Peru into Ecuador, as well as along Ecuador's border with Colombia. In an operation dubbed ""Armageddon 9,"" authorities intercepted two vehicles, raided several warehouses, arrested seven people, seized 500,000 rounds of ammunition and other explosives seemingly bound for Colombia's black market. While reports of weapons sales from the Ecuadorean army to Colombian criminal groups continue, this operation revealed that high-tech weapons from the United States and Mexico are entering Ecuador through Peru, and then being smuggled into Colombia at several points along the border. A report by Ecuadorean authorities explained that the weapons coming from Peru first arrived in El Oro province. From there, they seem to be frequently moved to the city of Guayaquil before being distributed and sold to criminal organizations and other armed groups operating along the Colombian border, notably in Ecuador's border provinces of Esmeraldas and Sucumbios. In the last nine years, Ecuador's police has seized around 40,000 smuggled weapons, including 12,000 high-caliber rifles, which were all bound for criminal organizations. Authorities have been on particularly high alert since October 2018, when ""Operation Chameleon"" broke up an arms trafficking ring which smuggled weapons from the Ecuadorean army to an ex-FARC mafia group known as the Oliver Sinisterra Front. This group of dissidents from the now largely demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) was under the orders of Walter Patricio Arizala, alias ""Guacho,"" who was one of the most wanted criminals in both Colombia and Ecuador up until his death in December 2018. Despite these successes, Colombian guerrillas continue to receive ""large quantities of munitions and high-caliber weaponry"" from transnational organized crime groups through Ecuador, according to Ecuadorean prosecutor Wilson Alvarez Valencia. Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo added that doubts remain regarding which organizations in Colombia are specifically receiving weapons from Peru and Ecuador. While the Oliver Sinisterra Front was among them, Romo said they were also equipped with weapons which are not part of the standard arsenal for Ecuador's security forces, such as 5.56mm and 9mm caliber weaponry. The Ecuadorean army has long faced an internal crisis about some of its elements selling weapons to criminals. The country has also been unable to curtail its role as a transshipment point for other arms smuggling networks. However, despite repeated operations, specifics about the origins of these weapons, the groups moving them and the criminal organizations receiving them, besides the Oliver Sinisterra Front, remain difficult to come by. The involvement of members of the Ecuadorean army is well documented, but successful seizures reveal an international connection on a far larger scale. Ecuador's government, while accepting responsibility for actions within its own military, has pointed to these larger arsenals coming from abroad through countries like Peru. The weapons seized during ""Operation Armageddon 9"" were being moved to a ""range of local groups"" in Colombia, according to a high-ranking government source consulted by InSight Crime. More specific information than that, however, was not available. Henry Troya, Ecuador's former deputy mining minister, told InSight Crime that caches of high-powered weaponry were discovered in flyovers to detect illegal mining operations, including ""bombs, grenades, missiles and long-range weapons."" One high-profile case might shine some more light on this. In April 2018, a team of three media workers from the Ecuadorean newspaper El Comercio was kidnapped and later killed by the Oliver Sinisterra Front along the Colombia-Ecuador border. However, Colombian and Ecuadorean authorities have not released a detailed ballistics report about which weapons were used to kill them. Ecuador has taken steps to curb the sell-off of its military equipment, but the practice still continues. Without major international assistance, the country does not have the investigative capacity to track the weapons coming in from outside, or to follow them once they move into Colombia."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Mexicos Public Security Lost 13,000 Weapons in 10 Years. Nearly 13,000 guns have been lost or stolen from Mexico's public security agencies over the last ten years, according to a recent report, a telling reminder that the country's black market weapons don't just come from north of the border. The majority of the 12,878 weapons that went missing or were stolen during that period disappeared in Mexico City, Mexico State, Chihuahua, Guerrero and Jalisco, according to documents from Mexico's National Institute of Transparency, Access to Information and Protection of Personal Data ( IFAI ) accessed by Milenio. In 2009, 800 guns were lost or stolen from local police stations in Mexico City -- 637 handguns and 163 long arms. That was also the year that the most guns vanished nationwide. (See Milenio's graph below) The Mexican government increased its purchase of firearms by more than three-fold in the first half of this decade. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ( Sipri ) reports that Mexico's arms imports grew by 331 percent between 2011-15 compared with 2006-10. The missing weapons described by Milenio were likely destined for Mexico's black market and bought up by organized criminal networks and, possibly, the armed vigilante groups operating in many parts of the Republic, for use against rival gangs as well as state agents. Significantly, these figures go some way to countering the idea that all illegal arms in Mexico come from the United States. Arms trafficked from Mexico's northern neighbor have been found to be the biggest source of illegal weapons for Mexican criminal gangs. A 2012 government study found that more than 70 percent of firearms recovered in Mexico in the five years prior could be traced to the US. The fact that so many guns have gone missing within Mexico, and reports that some cartels might even be manufacturing their own weapons , points to a diversification on the part of criminal gangs in how they source their weapons. The demand for guns has shot up parallel with the militarization of Mexico's so-called ""drug war"". The 331 percent increase of legal weapons imports from abroad shows that the Mexican government is arming up, not dialing it down."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Insecurity Fuels Honduras Illegal Gun Ownership of Over 1 Mn. Two thirds of the 1.8 million guns in Honduras are reportedly circulating illegally, with the country's geography and high perceptions of insecurity fueling gun ownership. According to newspaper La Tribuna , just 600,000 guns are legally registered, leaving 1.2 million guns in undocumented circulation. The total figure, if accurate, equates to nearly one gun for every four people in the country, with La Tribuna reporting their total estimated value to be $1.8 billion. The provinces with the highest concentration of illegal arms are Cortes, Atlantida, Colon, Copan, and Francisco Morazan. Former National Police Deputy Director Wilfredo Urtecho Jamborde said a key factor driving gun ownership was a popular perception that Honduran residents' security needs were not being met. The report comes almost a year after the Violence Observatory at the National Autonomous University of Honduras declared there were 500,000 registered guns in the country and one million circulating illegally. A previous report by the country's National Commissioner for Human Rights (CONADEH) placed this number even lower, at around 850,000 total guns, with 258,000 registered. While it is unclear whether the disparity between La Tribuna's figures and previously reported numbers are the result of a significant increase in guns circulating the country or methodological differences, all of the figures paint a grave picture of the illegal arms situation in Honduras. With the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) placing the homicide rate at 91.6 per 100,000 in its 2011 Global Study on Homicide , Honduras is widely considered the most dangerous country in the world outside of a warzone. Around 80 percent of all crimes are committed with unregistered guns. Despite recent talk of ramping up regulations , the country's gun laws remain lax. Whether a change in the law would have the needed effect is a matter for debate, with evidence suggesting there is little clear correlation between lax gun laws and gun violence in Latin America. What remains clear is that without effective action to combat corruption and deep rooted criminal activity, the violence is unlikely to subside and it is doubtful the public will be willing to hand in their weapons regardless of any law being passed.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Mexico Military Training State Police. In a sign of its increasingly militarized public security strategy, the Mexican military is training state police in tactics and the use of military-grade weaponry. According to a Mexican Ministry of Defense (SEDENA) report cited by Milenio, the Mexican army provided weapons training to state police in Hidalgo in order to prepare them for armed confrontations with drug cartels. The training is part of a larger nationwide program intended to better equip state police forces. The document shows that more than 250 police were trained in the use of automatic and sub-automatic rifles, and were given some basic tactical instruction. The training occurred in two sessions this year, lasting from January to May. The Milenio investigation also found that, from 2006 to 2011, the Hidalgo government ordered nearly $3 million in weaponry through SEDENA, including submachine guns and Galil model rifles. The military's involvement in Mexico's internal security is a controversial subject. While the military is believed to be less prone to criminal influence than police in the country, human rights advocates in the country worry that involving the military in policing can lead to abuses and may even contribute to violence in some cases. However, state and local police forces are often ill-equipped to confront foot soldiers of the powerful drug cartels in the country, which have easy access to AR-15 and AK-47 variant rifles, submachine guns and hand grenades on the black market. One problem with arming police officers, however, is the matter of whether these guns will actually stay in their possession. As InSight Crime has reported, Mexican state police have proven highly susceptible to corruption despite recent reform attempts. In September, for instance, the Mexican Navy arrested 35 state police in Veracruz for links to the Zetas.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Calderon Calls for Increased Gun Control After Colorado Shooting. President Felipe Calderon pointed to the recent mass shooting in a Colorado movie theater as a reason to push for increased gun control in the United States. On July 22, while tweeting his condolences for the shooting victims in Aurora, Colorado, Mexican President Felipe Calderon criticized American gun policy. Calderon argued that the murders are another reason for Congress to revise gun control legislation, claiming that the laws ""hurt all of us."" This is not the first time that Calderon has raised the issue. In April at a summit of the North American leaders, Calderon criticized lax American gun control policies for allowing firearms to flow across the Mexican border into the hands of criminal groups. In February, the president unveiled a billboard near the international border calling for ""No More Weapons!"" to be smuggled into the country from the US. Despite Calderon's comments, it is unlikely that the recent shooting in Colorado will prompt gun reform anytime soon. A Pew poll in April demonstrated an overall lack of public support for gun reform, with 49 percent of Americans saying that it is more important to protect gun rights, and 45 percent saying that it is more important to control gun ownership. The figures concerning the amount of guns brought into Mexico from the US are contested. US Justice Department data shows that close to 70 percent of the firearms Mexican authorities recovered and submitted for trace tests over the past five years can be traced back to the US. On the other hand, the Annemberg Public Policy Center's FactCheck.org calculated that 36 percent of the total number of seized guns in Mexico originated in the US. The US is not the only source of weapons in Mexico: the Zetas, for example, have also obtained high-powered weapons from military arsenals in Guatemala. But it is clear that it is all too easy for gun smugglers to use middlemen -- or ""straw buyers"" -- to purchase high-power weapons north of the border. In one recent case on July 9, US authorities busted an alleged ""straw buying"" ring in Texas that provided automatic rifles to the Zetas. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Latin American Leaders Demand Action on Illicit Arms Trafficking. The 2011 Ibero-American Summit, held in Asuncion, Paraguay in October, was criticized for its failures, but leaders used the platform to call attention to the global arms trade and demand international cooperation on more effective measures to fight weapons trafficking and organized crime. At the close of the summit, the member countries issued a separate and special declaration (available in pdf format here ) defining public security as a precondition for economic and social progress and calling for international cooperation, technical assistance and legislation to combat the illicit trafficking of weapons. Mexico's President Felipe Calderon also called on the international community to provide financial and technical assistance to the region and urged his counterparts in Latin America to strengthen legislative controls on the possession and use of firearms, ammunition and explosives. These calls for a more regional approach to curbing arms trafficking were overshadowed by a controversial outburst from Ecuador's president, the absence of 11 heads-of-state and the summit's macro-economic themes. But inside the summit walls, public security emerged as a top concern and representatives of a region struggling with high rates of violence and criminality used the platform to call for agreement on regulating the international arms trade. The surge in violent crime in Latin America has been particularly devastating to countries that have resources important to drug trafficking networks and relatively weak state institutions. Honduras, for example, is a transit country for the majority of cocaine smuggled out of South America and is on track to have the highest murder rate in the world. A recent United Nations report (pdf available here ) says that 31 percent of the estimated 468,000 intentional homicides committed around the world in 2010 occurred in the Americas. And firearms, which were used in 42 percent of violent deaths, ""undoubtedly drive homicide increases in certain regions and, where they do, members of organized criminal groups are often those who pull the trigger,"" according to the UN. The ability of Latin American countries to control firearm availability certainly depends on international cooperation. Unfortunately, weapons transfers can take place on a relatively small scale without triggering attention from federal authorities. A variety of obstacles prevent stricter control over domestic guns sales in the U.S., such as powerful lobbying groups like the National Rifle Association and their congressional allies who block legislation that would tighten federal control over gun sales. The availability of powerful assault weapons in the U.S. has likely had an effect on violence in the region. An analysis by blogger Diego de Valle illustrates how the expiration of the ban on assault weapons in the U.S. is correlated with rising homicide rates in the war against (and amongst) the drug cartels. Access to U.S. assault weapons may also be related to the rise in incidents of multiple homicides in Mexico. The U.S. is an important player in controlling the circulation of illegal weapons in Mexico, but it is only one of many. According to arms expert Keith Krause, substantial quantities of weapons seized from Mexico's criminals originate in Mexico or Central America. Honduras, for example, recently admitted that it cannot account for thousands of guns that disappeared from government warehouses. Many weapons that were funnelled to Central America to fight 20th century conflicts are still circulating today, fueling narcotics-related conflict in Mexico, El Salvador and Guatemala. But controlling this market is a tall order for any country or region. The illicit global market for small arms and light weapons (SALW) is estimated to be worth approximately $1 billion dollars annually. Trade flourishes in part because of a large gray market of legal guns that become illegal when they are lost or stolen from government stockpiles. Government weapons and ammunition stockpiles that are poorly monitored can be diverted to this gray market with little risk because, in the absence of a universal marking and tracking system, it is difficult to trace to a ""legitimate"" owner and hold that person accountable. The long career of international arms dealer Victor Bout, and his eventual capture in a DEA sting explicitly demonstrates of the need for a global treaty on the weapons trade, according to Oxfam International. Despite significant evidence of Bout's participation in illegal weapons sales, he was able to continue to sell guns and fuel conflict in the world's worst war zones for two decades. Currently, only 73 (out of 154) countries regulate trade in light weapons and, of those, only 56 have laws criminalizing their illicit transfer. The lack of a global treaty addressing the trade in SALW allows gun traffickers to avoid both arrest in countries that lack penalties and extradition to countries with comprehensive, enforceable laws. Currently, commodities like bananas and electronics are highly regulated under international law, but there are no substantial agreements requiring states to monitor and restrict transfers of arms and ammunition around the globe. This may change. A proposed global Arms Trade Agreement will be debated in the UN next year. And while it will not eliminate the illicit trade in guns, it can reduce the availability of military-grade weapons on the shadowy gray market and clarify the fuzzy boundaries between licit and illict trade in weapons responsible for hundreds of thousands violent deaths. It may also give Latin American and Caribbean governments a template for further regional and domestic action on this issue. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"E-mails: FARC Planned to Buy Illicit Arms from Neighbors. On Saturday, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos released a series of intercepted emails between leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) in which they communicated plans to purchase black market weapons from other countries in the region. According to El Colombiano , the email was sent from the computer of guerrilla leader Victor Julio Suarez Rojas, alias "" Mono Jojoy ,"" which was captured after his death last September in a military campaign. Suarez allegedly wrote about his organization's efforts to purchase weapons on the country's border with Ecuador, and mentioned the borders with Venezuela and Brazil as sources of ammunition. Citing the emails in a speech on economic development, Santos called them ""an indicator of how important it is to have good relations with one's neighbors,"" going on to praise the neighboring governments for recent border security efforts. The praise comes just five months before Venezuela is set to open a Kalashnikov rifle factory with the assistance of Russian arms company Rosoboronexport. According to the Colombian daily El Espectador , production will start in May 2011, and the factory will produce between 20,000 and 30,000 rifles per year. Because the rifle's relatively low cost, durability and ease of use make it a weapon of choice for insurgencies and criminal gangs across the globe, the deal has many analysts worried that some of the weapons could fuel the conflict in Colombia. According to a 2003 study published by the RAND Corporation , ""Although there is no definitive evidence at this point that links the administration of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to a deliberate policy of arming Colombia's guerrillas, it is possible that sympathetic individual members of the Venezuelan military have supplied both weapons and ammunition [to the guerrillas].""

"In Gun Case, U.S. Govt Has a Look in the Mirror. It took the death of one its own agents to get the United States Government to begin an inquiry into why federal authorities often watch while guns, purchased by what are known ""straw buyers,"" are trafficked to the border to be sold to criminal organizations. The inquiry is focused on whether some of these weapons, which are purchased in the thousands of gun stores along the U.S.-Mexico border, were used in an ambush on a special unit of the Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) on 14 December, which resulted in the death of agent Brian Terry. As reported by the Associated Press, U.S. Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa sent at least two letters to the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), inquiring about the case. Neither the article nor the letters explain which case the incident relates to, but the timing is curious. Last week, federal authorities announced they had arrested 20 suspects in an arms trafficking case that centered on various weapons dealers and ""straw buyers"" in Arizona. The case involved hundreds of weapons that the ATF said were mostly going via these ""straw buyers"" to the Sinaloa Cartel , widely recognized as the largest drug trafficking organization in the hemisphere. The indictment said the buyers purchased numerous AK-47 assault rifles, .50 caliber shotguns and powerful Belgium-made handguns known popularly as ""cop-killers"" -- for their ability to penetrate kevlar and other protective gear -- at the behest of middlemen who moved the weapons south to be resold on the black market. Authorities watched the suspects for fifteen months before arresting them. Fourteen more suspects in related cases remain at large, authorities said last week. As InSight noted, the case illustrated both the incredible ease with which these buyers obtained the guns, and the incredible difficulty the United States authorities have in prosecuting these same buyers. Mexican government officials are concerned by the lax regulations and the inability of the United States government to stop the mass purchases and smuggling of weapons over its border. Over 34,000 people have been killed in Mexico since 2006, in organized crime-related cases, authorities said. But Mexican authorities are also at fault for their inability to stem the weapons flow from the border to the country's various hotspots where drug trafficking gangs are battling for control of lucrative 'plazas,' or trafficking corridors, with both security forces and themselves. It is a subject that is important to InSight as well. And today, InSight, in conjunction with Frontline , the Center for Public Integrity and the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University launched what will be an ongoing project looking into the path that weapons take, from the manufacturer in Romania, to the importer in Vermont, the gun seller in Arizona and the drug trafficking groups in Mexico.

"Counter-Arms Trafficking Measures Yield Mixed Results. Lack of inter-agency cooperation is hindering efforts to stem arms trafficking at the U.S-Mexico border, says a 2009 draft report issued by the Justice Department. NBC sums up the report's findings regarding the effectiveness of Project Gunrunner, a U.S. task force formed in 2005 that tracks gun smuggling into Mexico. The task force just received $37 million from Congress, and the ATF announced Tuesday that seven new Project Gunrunner teams will be dispatched in key cities across the U.S., including Atlanta, Dallas and Sierra Vista, Arizona, reportedly an important hub for the Sinaloa Cartel. However, the Justice Department's draft report finds there are ""significant weaknesses"" in Project Gunrunner, notably, the ""ATF does not systematically exchange intelligence with its Mexican and some U.S. partner agencies."" This is preoccupying: especially considering that the same groups involved in smuggling arms is probably also involved in drugs and human trafficking, more collaboration between agencies like the ATF, the DEA, Homeland Security, and Mexican offices could only be more helpful than harmful. It looks as though the task force has been relatively effective since its creation: since 2005 Project Gunrunner has seized 6,668 firearms and referred 497 cases to the Justice Department. But there are other challenges besides the lack of shared intelligence. Not only are offices understaffed in the Southwest U.S. and in Mexico, NBC reports, but weak gun laws have made it difficult for courts to successfully prosecute some arms-trafficking cases. Currently there is no federal law that would notify authorities if large amounts of AK-47s and other semi-automatics are purchased in a short period of time. Existing laws also need to be better enforced, so that rogue gun stores can more easily lose their license. Other solutions appear more short-term. As NBC notes, the White House has not yet nominated a director at the ATF, for fear of riling up the U.S. gun lobby. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Despite Confession, Former El Salvador Presidents Sentencing Is Bittersweet. An ex-president in El Salvador has become the first former head of state in the country to confess to corruption and later receive prison time for it, but the light sentence handed down as part of the plea deal he struck with authorities makes this moment bittersweet. Former El Salvador President Elias Antonio ""Tony"" Saca, who served the country between 2004 and 2009, was sentenced September 12 to 10 years in prison for embezzlement and money laundering, and was ordered to pay $260 million as part of a plea agreement with prosecutors, the Attorney General's Office announced in a press release. Prosecutors asked for five years for embezzlement and five more for money laundering as part of the plea deal. However, this is just a fraction of the 30-year prison sentence that Saca could have faced without the agreement for the crimes he committed, according to El Faro. Saca and his co-conspirators were arrested in October 2016 on corruption charges and were accused of embezzlement, illicit association and money laundering. They were accused of embezzling more than $300 million from state coffers into personal bank accounts. Saca pleaded guilty to these charges in August 2018 in a historic confession that marked the first time a former Salvadoran president confessed to committing such crimes. Saca seemed to have a premeditated plan for how he would rob the state. A law passed shortly after he took office approving the ""internal regulation of the use of public funds"" allowed him to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars from the state's accounts into his own personal accounts through checks and money transfers without leaving much of a paper trail behind. In addition, the former president overspent the state's money by handing out bonuses, paying for travel expenses, bribing journalists and transferring money to the accounts of the right-wing National Republican Alliance (Alianza Republicana Nacionalista -- ARENA) political party, which he headed at the time. The sentencing of former El Salvador President Saca marks a historic moment in the fight against corruption in the Central American nation, but his light sentence comes as little surprise given the country's shortcomings with combating widespread graft. Former President Saca's corruption network penetrated all aspects of Salvadoran society, from government institutions to prominent business elites and the country's media. But Saca, who headed the network, didn't receive the harshest sentence. Despite confessing to robbing the state of more than $300 million, the former president's 10-year prison term was less than the 16 years in prison that Pablo Gomez, one of the network's lower-level members responsible for writing checks, received. While Saca's confession is historic, he is not the first Salvadoran president to become entangled in the corruption that has come to define the country's politics. Saca's predecessor, Francisco Flores, was accused of embezzling millions of dollars of the state's money. And Saca's successor, Mauricio Funes, was convicted of illicit enrichment in 2017. What was different about Saca, however, was his and his family's strong links to organized crime. Saca's cousin, Herbert Ernesto Saca Vides, was one of El Salvador's most effective political fixers due to his links to both organized crime groups, like the infamous Los Perrones, and the upper echelons of the country's political elite."	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Convicts Trafficker Chepe Handal on Second Set of Charges. Honduras has convicted a major drug trafficker wanted for extradition by the United States in a second case against him, illustrating the country's resolve to improve the capacity of its judiciary. Jose Miguel Handal Perez, alias ""Chepe Handal,"" and his wife were found guilty of money laundering on August 21, the Attorney General's Office announced in a press release. Proceedings against Jose Miguel's father, Jose Miguel Handal Larach, also known by the alias ""Chepe,"" were closed as the suspect passed away earlier this month. The investigation began in 2015 with a probe into suspicious transactions in US and Honduran bank accounts held by the family. Authorities uncovered more than 52 million lempiras (around $2.2 million) of unjustified deposits. In March of this year, the younger Chepe Handal was condemned to 10 years in prison after having been found guilty of trafficking 1.6 metric tons of cocaine. Chepe Handal was once a major figure in the international drug chain, playing the role of middleman between Colombian groups supplying cocaine and the Mexican Sinaloa and Zetas cartels that handled distribution to the United States, according to US authorities. Operating out of Honduras, he would ensure the smooth transit of drugs through the Central American corridor. In 2013, he became the first high profile Honduran national to be added to the US Treasury Department's ""Kingpin List."" According to La Prensa , Chepe Handal has asked his lawyer to speed up his case for extradition to the United States, which is currently being reviewed by Honduras' Supreme Court. The objective of this move is unclear, however, as his potential extradition would only be carried out after he completed his prison sentence in Honduras. In addition to being the first high profile Honduran added to the Kingpin List, Chepe Handal is representative of the deep links between elites and organized crime in the country. Indeed, the former congressional candidate was long thought to have enjoyed powerful political protection. SEE ALSO : Honduras Elites and Organized Crime The case is also important with regard to Honduras' efforts to build up its judicial institutions. The country has succeeded in delivering serious blows to organized crime in terms of arresting top suspects and seizing assets linked to criminal activities. But Honduran officials have often outsourced prosecutions of these defendants to their US counterparts, reflecting concerns about the weakness of the judicial system. Nevertheless, the successful prosecutions of Chepe Handal shows that the country is making strides toward improving its prosecutorial capacities."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Crime Boss Allegedly Laundered Money With Panama Companies. Jose Adan Salazar Umana, alias ""Chepe Diablo,"" has been accused of laundering money via shell companies in Panama, a reminder of the important role these corporate structures play for criminal groups in Latin America. El Salvador's Attorney General Office said Jose Adan Salazar Umana, alias ""Chepe Diablo,"" suspected leader of the Texis cartel, allegedly opened front companies in Panama to launder money, reported La Prensa Grafica on April 6. Chepe Diablo was captured on April 4 and is accused of managing a criminal organization responsible for laundering an estimated $215 million. Jorge Cortez, head of the Attorney General's Financial Investigation Unit said Chepe Diablo began to set up corporations in Panama once his name appeared on the US Treasury Department's ""Kingpin List"" in May 2014 and his Salvadoran bank accounts were closed as a result. As Chepe Diablo's organization ""was accumulating a lot of money,"" members of the criminal group decided to ""create companies using the names of other people,"" Cortez was quoted by La Prensa Grafica as saying. Three people have been implicated in Chepe Diablo's money laundering scheme in Guatemala, La Prensa Grafica reported separately on April 17. One of them, Rodolfo Jose Leiva Fajardo, is allegedly linked with a Panamanian company whose name reportedly appeared in the massive document leak last year that became known as the Panama Papers. Chepe Diablo was removed from the OFAC list on April 7, 2017, but he is still detained in El Salvador, where he awaits his trial. The fact that Chepe Diablo allegedly relied on shell companies to launder money should not come as a surprise. A recent report from Global Financial Integrity, an advocacy organization based in Washington, DC, estimated that transnational illegal activities generate between $1.6 and $2.2 trillion per year , much of which flows through legal financial structures, including shell companies. Organized crime groups must reinvest their revenues to allow their criminal operations to continue. In order to do so, criminal networks have long used shell companies with the aim of laundering money through banks without being detected. To a lesser degree, they have also relied on trade-based laundering schemes that hide illegal financial flows by making them seem like legitimate business transactions. The uncovering of the Panama Papers scandal did seem to boost the fight for financial transparency across the region. But as InSight Crime has previously reported , and as the Chepe Diablo case shows, Latin America still has a long way to go in terms of strengthening anti-money laundering policies and combating the illicit financial flows that allow crime groups to continue their activities."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Latin Americas Weak Points in Fighting Money Laundering. Every year, the US State Department releases a detailed policy breakdown for countries considered major hubs for money laundering and other financial crimes. This year, Latin America has 14 countries and one constituent country on the list, all of which have been identified as having a long way to go in terms of improving their anti-money laundering policy. Below is InSight Crime's summary of some of the most important issues in each Latin American country when it comes to money laundering, as identified by the US State Department. Click through the table of contents below to go to a country of interest. Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean Belize Costa Rica Curacao Dominican Republic Guatemala Haiti Mexico Panama South America Argentina Bolivia Brazil Colombia Paraguay Uruguay Venezuela Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean Belize - Despite strengthening anti-money laundering legislation, the units charged with investigating cases are seriously understaffed. The country's financial intelligence unit, for example, only has one ""less-experienced"" prosectuor. - Major money laundering cases have a tendency to go nowhere in Belize's highest courts. In 2014, the US -- in collaboration with Belize -- indicted six businessmen and six corporate entities for alleged involvement in a $500 million money laundering scheme. However, Belize's Chief Justice ruled that the case could not go forward due to insufficient evidence. Costa Rica - Costa Rica's increased importance in transnational drug trafficking has led to increased money laundering. Notably, in 2014 the head of the country's intelligence agency said an estimated $4.2 billion is laundered in the country every year. Much of the cash earned from illicit activies is laundered in Costa Rica's construction trade, according to the US State Department report. - Few are successfully convicted of money laundering. In 2014, there were just 21 people convicted on money laundering related charges. Curacao - The Caribbean island is considered a major hub for laundered drug money. Its proximity to other major drug transit points, such as Venezuela and Colombia, helps contributes to this, as well as lax regulations. - One of Curacao's biggest money laundering investigations suggests that local elites are involved in this crime. In 2014, Curacao opened a probe into a major lottery operator who is reportedly a major donor to a political party. A former prime minister and a current member of parliament are also currently under investigation for alleged money laundering crimes, the US State Department report says. Dominican Republic - The country's large informal economy facilitates the smuggling of illicit goods and helps make the Dominican Republic vulnerable to financial crimes. More specifically, a major problem is ongoing under-reporting of imports and exports, which the report describes as ""a relatively common practice for those seeking to avoid taxes and customs fees."" - The Dominican Republic's financial intelligence unit thinks it has improved enough to be re-admitted in a major intelligence network that cooperates on financial crime. The country was first kicked out of that network, known as the Egmont Group , in 2006. Guatemala - The ""La Linea"" corruption scandal has increased pressure on banks to report suspicious activity. The scandal, which forced the country's president and vice president to resign , involved millions of dollars of bribes paid by importers. - One major issue is bulk amounts of illicit cash smuggled out of the country by plane. Law enforcement agencies say that air travelers will smuggle cash in shipments smaller than $10,000 -- Guatemala's official reporting requirement -- to countries like Panama. The report identifies ""lax oversight of private international flights originating in Guatemala"" as another problem. Haiti - More than half of all bank deposits in Haiti may be made up of foreign currencies , a possible sign of the country's vulnerability to money laundering, the report states. During the first eight months of 2015, foreign currency made up 60 percent of all bank deposits in the country, a three percent increase from the previous year. - Haiti's judicial sector has a weak record when it comes to investigating money laundering. The country's financial intelligence unit was looking into 15 cases in 2015, but did not send any to the judiciary. Mexico - After Mexico restricted dollar cash deposits in 2010, criminal groups began laundering their wealth via traded goods rather than cash. One example of this trend was the Sinaloa Cartel using fashion businesses in Los Angeles for trade-based money laundering. - In 2014, the Mexican government said that border businesses could make larger cash deposits if they agreed to let authorities monitor their financial transactions. However, according to the US State Department report, few in Mexico have taken advantage of this. It's unclear whether this is due to fear of the additional reporting requirements, or because there's ""lack of interest"" in receiving larger deposits of US cash. Panama - Panama's limited regulation of bearer shares is a major reason why the country remains a hub for money laundering. As InSight Crime has reported , those who own, buy, or sell bearer shares aren't required to keep any sort of record of the transaction. However, a law which came into effect in December 2015 restricts use of these shares. - While Panama has made advances in its enforcement of anti-money laundering legislation, there is still much more to be done. Panama was removed from an international money laundering watchlist earlier this year, but the judicial branch still has little capacity to successfully prosecute and convict money launderers, the reports states. South America Argentina - The US must decide whether it will resume sharing information with Argentina's financial intelligence agency. The US Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCen, suspended information sharing with Argentina in June 2015, after Argentina's government allegedly used US financial intelligence for political purposes. FinCen had previously suspended sharing intelligence with Argentina between 2009 to 2012. - Money laundering convictions remain low. Since 1999, only seven such cases have been successfully prosecuted in Argentina. Bolivia - The size of Bolivia's informal economy means there are plenty of opportunities for laundering money via smuggled goods. Most of these illicit goods are smuggled in from Chile and then informally exported to Brazil and Argentina, the report states - While Bolivia's financial intelligence unit has gained greater independence, there is less transparency when it comes to money laundering-related statistics. Since 2014, the financial intelligence unit has reported to the Ministry of Economics rather than Bolivia's main financial regulatory body, a move that was meant to make the unit more independent. However, since then, the unit has no longer released statistics about financial crime online. Brazil - Lack of statistics makes it difficult to assess Brazil's process in combating money laundering. The government does not maintain up-to-date numbers of money laundering prosecutions or convictions. - Improved investigation of money laundering cases may yet unveil other corruption scandals in Brazil. The country's ongoing Petrobras scandal initially began in 2014 as a money laundering investigation involving a gas station. Colombia - Investigations are hampered by a law that requires Colombia's financial intelligence unit to report only to the Attorney General's Office. This lack of coordination with other law enforcement bodies ""increases case processing time and adds unnecessarily to prosecutor caseloads,"" the report states. - The formal process by which government agencies can seize criminal assets still isn't streamlined enough. Colombia passed a law in 2014 that was supposed to make it easier to seize criminal assets, but many remain unfamiliar with the law, the report notes. Paraguay - Paraguay took some important steps in 2015 , including creating an anti-money laundering unit within the Attorney General's Office. The country also passed a law requiring better regulations of bearer shares, which, as in Panama , are considered highly vulnerable to money laundering. Nevertheless, the country is still considered a major money laundering hub, partly due to its giant contraband cigarette trade. Uruguay - Uruguay is cracking down dramatically on bearer shares , especially when compared to efforts in Paraguay and Panama. The government eliminated about 85,000 bearer shares in 2015 after the owners failed to come forward and identify themselves. - While the US State Department does not see Uruguay as a major hub for money laundering, the country remains vulnerable due to its highly dollarized economy , among other reasons. According to the report, some 80 percent of all banking deposits in Uruguay are done in US dollars. Venezuela - There is ample opportunity in Venezuela for ""financial abuse,"" due to its foreign exchange system and price controls, its status as a drug transit country, corruption, and its porous border with Colombia , the report states. - Venezuela's black market exchange rate has also created many opportunities for money laundering. While the official exchange rate is six bolivares to the dollar, on the black market it is 873 bolivares per dollar."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Mexico Going from Bad to Worse in Prosecuting Money Laundering. Government statistics in Mexico demonstrate how already weak efforts to combat money laundering appear to be getting worse under the current administration, suggesting there is a lack of political will and resources to tackle a key component of organized crime. According to documents obtained by El Universal from Mexico's Attorney General's Office (PGR), 33 money-laundering groups were dismantled and roughly $300 million at today's exchange rate (taking into account the variable rates over the period) was seized in pesos and dollars between 2001 and 2014. Of these 33 groups, 23 were dismantled during the administration of Felipe Calderon (2006-2012), seven during the term of Vicente Fox (2000-2006), and just three under the current administration of Enrique Pena Nieto. During the first full two years of Pena Nieto's presidency (2013-2014), the amount of laundered money seized dropped in comparison with the same period under Calderon (2007-2008), falling from a total of just over $90 million to around $13 million. Angelica Ortiz Dorantes -- an expert on money-laundering prevention -- explained the drop in money seizures under Pena Nieto does not necessarily mean a lack of government action, but instead may be signs greater controls and preventative measures implemented with a 2013 anti-money laundering law are having success. However, national security expert Gerardo Rodriguez Sanchez Lara called the PGR's figures ""laughable"" given the tools at the disposal of investigators, saying the numbers represented ""a very low percentage"" of the estimated size of the criminal economy. According to El Universal, the Secretariat of Property and Public Credit (SHCP) has estimated $10 billion is laundered annually in Mexico, although some US officials have put this number as high as $29 billion. Sanchez said the figures showed the failings of the Mexican government in combating money laundering, which he attributed to the weak capacity of the SHCP's Financial Intelligence Unit. Another obstacle, Angelica Ortiz added, is that anti-money laundering investigators lack the means for filtering the masses of information they receive. Money laundering is an essential activity for organized crime groups in Mexico and throughout the region, and criminal networks have proven creative in discovering new ways to legalize the massive amounts of cash coming their way, making combating the crime an uphill task. Yet, as the PGR's owns figures suggest, progress towards combating money laundering has been slow, with fewer prosecutions and money seized since the passing of legislation in 2013. As InSight Crime noted at the time the law came into force, it is often easier to pass laws than to prosecute money laundering on a large scale, which requires levels of political will and resources Mexico has yet to demonstrate it is willing to dedicate to the problem."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Contraband Beef Used to Launder Colombia Drug Money. Colombian officials have seized 11 tons of contraband meat near the border with Venezuela, which authorities have linked to the money laundering operations of guerrillas and other drug trafficking organizations. Colombia's National Directorate of Taxes and Customs (DIAN) discovered a truck packed with meat from an estimated 600 cows in the city of Cucuta in Norte de Santander. Authorities believe the trade in contraband beef in the region is linked to the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the drug trafficking neo-paramilitary groups the Urabenos and the Rastrojos. The groups allegedly use the meat trade to launder money and generate revenues to purchase coca, reported Caracol Radio. DIAN director Juan Ricardo Ortega said that the trade takes advantage of the black market in Venezuelan bolivares, which trades in at just over six to the dollar according to the government's official exchange rate, but can be bought unofficially at 29 to the dollar in the underground economy. The groups purchase the meat in Venezuela at black market prices then sell it on in Colombia, Ortega said. Venezuelan border region Norte de Santander is a coca growing zone and trafficking hub that is home to the FARC, the National Liberation Army (ELN), and the narco-paramilitary groups known as the BACRIM (""bandas criminales,"" or criminal bands). It is a common money laundering practice for such groups to invest drug profits in contraband purchased outside of Colombia, typically involving cigarettes, alcohol, and domestic appliances. The goods are then smuggled into Colombia and sold on at discount prices. The Venezuelan border region is an attractive location for such activities, as the manipulation of the black market in bolivares increases the profits to be made."	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
Bolivia to Toughen Money Laundering Laws. Bolivia plans to strengthen sanctions against financial insitutions that fail to report suspicious transactions, which could signal money laundering, to the authorities. Finance Minister Luis Arce annouced the scheme and said that the penalties would range from fines to the suspension of operating licences. There will also be personal penalties for individuals involved in failures to report such transactions. The criminal code currently lacks sanctions against institutions and individuals which turn a blind eye to laundering. This move will bring Bolivia into line with international standards, according to the government. The government estimated recently that drug trafficking in Bolivia has revenues of between $300 million and $700 million a year. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Costa Rica Organ Trafficking Trial Links Illicit Transplant Network to Ukraine. New details have emerged regarding the inner workings of a sophisticated organ trafficking network with international ties operating in Costa Rica, suggesting that the country's role in the international illicit organ trade may be evolving. During the course of a trial for suspects allegedly involved in an organ trafficking ring in Costa Rica, judicial investigator Diego Castillo Gomez said that the alleged network may have had ties to Ukraine, La Nacion reported September 15. Costa Rican authorities first received a request from their Ukrainian counterparts in 2012 to investigate a telephone number linked to two Ukrainians who had been detained for organ trafficking, Castillo said. Upon further investigation, investigators discovered the phone number was used a number of times to communicate with Francisco Jose Mora Palma, a kidney doctor who was arrested in June 2013 along with two others for allegedly leading the illicit organ trafficking network. In February 2016, Costa Rican authorities formally announced charges against several individuals allegedly involved in the network and eventually took the case, the first of its kind in the country, to trial. Previous allegations had already tied Mora Palma's ring to both local and international actors. Among those allegedly involved in the network were Costa Rican urologists Maximiliano Mauro Stamati and Fabian Fonseca Guzman, peripheral vascular specialist Victor Hugo Monge, as well as Costan Rican National Police officer Maureen Cordero Solano, who was also allegedly one of Mora Palma's victims and received 6 million colones (around $10,400) for one of her kidneys. According to La Nacion, Solano would first target impoverished local citizens to recruit them as kidney ""donors,"" allegedly earning $1,000 for each donor she recruited. Afterwards, Solano would direct the donors to a Greek businessman, Dimosthenis Katsigiannis Karkasi, who would offer them up to 10,000 colones (around $17,400) for the kidney. Karkasi, who owned a pizza shop across from the hospital where Mora Palma worked, would then take the ""donors"" for a consultation with the doctor to initiate pre-operation procedures, followed by a private examination. After then being transferred to one of the private hospitals, Mora Palma, with the help of the urologists and peripheral vascular specialist, would extract the kidneys and transplant them into the recipients, who allegedly paid at least $140,000 per procedure, $40,000 of which was supposed to go to the donors. Afterwards, Mora Palma allegedly paid the donors in cash, if he paid them at all, and made them sign notarized declarations that stated they did not receive any payment for the kidney. As in the United States , it is illegal to pay someone for his or her organs in Costa Rica. According to Castillo's testimony, Mora Palma coordinated examinations and operations for at least 14 kidney transplants at the private Bible Clinic and Catholic Clinic Hospitals. Mora Palma served for 13 years as the head of the nephrology department at the publicly-run Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia Hospital in Costa Rica's capital, San Jose, and he allegedly worked out of his office at the hospital. Mora Palma is charged with 14 counts of human trafficking with the purpose of illicit organ extraction, and 16 counts of embezzlement for using equipment and faciliates of the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social - CCSS) to commit the crimes, among other charges. By all accounts, authorities in Costa Rica appear to have uncovered a major international organ trafficking ring operating in the country. Indeed, a 2014 investigation by the New York Times linked Mora Palma's network -- which had reportedly been operating since at least 2011 -- with ""central players in Israel's sizeable black market for kidneys."" However, according to Colombian lawyer Luz Estella Ortiz-Nagle, who is a recognized expert in human trafficking, Costa Rica may be transforming from a tiny player in the global organ trafficking trade into an "" epicenter "" for illegal organ trafficking, in large part due to corruption that has helped fuel a sophisticated "" transplant tourism "" industry as well as the global imbalance between the limited supply of kidneys and the high demand for transplants. Ortiz-Nagle explained in a June 2017 interview with La Nacion that corrupting officials in various sectors is essential for these networks to operate successfully given the breadth of their operations. ""There is a facilitator or recruiter who locates the victim or donor an international coordinator or broker, a site for the transplant, a recipient who receives the donation, and medical professionals: transplant doctors, anesthesiologists, nurses, medical technicians, laboratories and hospital administrators,"" she said. According to the US State Department's 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report , the Costa Rican government is making significant efforts to combat trafficking, but still does not comply with US minimum standards."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"2 Million Children Sexually Exploited in LatAm: Womens Coalition. Approximately two million children and adolescents are currently sexually exploited in Latin America, according to an anti-sex trafficking coalition, highlighting the potential scale of a transnational crime that all too often goes unpunished. Ecuador's country head of the Latin American Coalition Against Trafficking Women - Latin America and the Caribbean (CATW-LAC), Rocio Rosero, attributed this alarming statistic in part to trafficking networks that trick children into prostitution in other countries, reported EFE. According to the coalition leader, available statistics don't show the full scope of the problem because information is ""under-recorded."" Rosero added the dual problems of prostitution and sexual exploitation are fuelled by sexist Latin American ""machismo,"" culture and poverty. Rosero made the comments at the launch of ""Tu Plata Maltrata"" (Your Money Mistreats), a Quito program that works to raise awareness of the crime of sexual exploitation. In Ecuador, 5,000 children are sexually exploited, she said, with many of them sent abroad as prostitutes. The coalition also indicated that impunity is a serious problem. On March 20, CATW-LAC Director Teresa Ulloa Ziaurriz stated that 99 percent of cases of disappeared persons in Mexico -- many of these a result of human trafficking -- go unpunished. She attributed this largely to failings on the part of the Attorney General's Office. CATW-LAC is a regional coalition that works to prevent sexual exploitation of women and children through awareness campaigns and petitions, as well as technical assistance to similarly oriented feminist groups in various countries throughout Latin America. The CATW-LAC statistics are shocking, though widespread reports of child exploitation make them plausible. A Mexican congresswoman claimed last March that 800,000 adults and 20,000 children were trafficked for sexual purposes each year in Mexico alone, while 75,000 children have been registered as missing by the government since 2006. In Colombia, there were an estimated 35,000 exploited minors as of March 2011, with Cartagena a known sex tourism hub. Various kinds of networks and circumstances are responsible for child and adolescent exploitation. Often intermediaries or small criminal gangs recruit children through trickery and empty promises or by capitalizing on the poverty of the parents. However, there are also suggestions that larger criminal mafias, especially the the Zetas in Mexico , are increasingly involved in the trade. In the majority of countries, few sex trafficking prosecutions occur. Both government inefficacy, and the frequently international nature of the crime, make it difficult to put a stop to, as highlighted recently by an investigation uncovering the ability of registered Canadian sex offenders to access child prostitutes in Cuba ."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Peru Extortion Gang Goes Multinational. A criminal group from Peru dedicated principally to extortion of the construction sector has reportedly joined forces with similar groups in Ecuador, Bolivia, and Colombia, an indicator the group is almost certainly diversifying its business portfolio. According to Peruvian police, the Gran Familia, which has its roots in the coastal Peruvian city of Chiclayo, has built business connections with gangs that prey on the construction sector in other Andean nations, reported La Republica. Together, these organizations have reportedly carried out attacks on prominent businessmen. The gang has allegedly recruited more criminals and has placed them in specialized roles based on nationality, according to police reports accessed by La Republica. Peruvian and Ecuadorean members are allegedly in charge of extortion, while the Colombians act as hired killers. According to La Republica, the imprisoned former leader of the group, Angel Roman Leon Arevalo, alias ""Viejo Paco,"" continues to direct some operations from jail. The coordinator working on the ground in Ecuador is allegedly Charles Orlando Palomino Bravo, alias ""Chacho Palomino,"" one of Viejo Paco's chief operators. The report comes two weeks after one of the group's high-level operatives was captured in Chiclayo in possession of passports that allowed him to move between Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Bolivia. It's unclear from the report to what extent the Gran Familia has moved operations into neighboring countries, but their goal in expanding is likely one or both of the following: escape law enforcement; establish new streams of income. The Gran Familia appears to have reached a point where expansion is both necessary and possible. While the report indicates the group is continuing to focus on extortion abroad, it is also possible it could be looking to tap into neighboring drug markets. Police have accused the organization in the past of involvement in drug trafficking and money laundering as well as extortion, kidnapping, and homicide. But groups like the Gran Familia, who depend mostly on muscle and intimidation to make their money, often find it harder to operate in foreign territory (see what happened to the Zetas in Guatemala ). Peruvian authorities dealt a serious, and some said ""death"" blow to the Gran Familia in 2012, with the arrest of Viejo Paco and several other high level members. However, La Republica's article follows on reports of the group moving its center of operations to Lima , members working as hired assassins in central Peru, and the incorporation of a new leader , who is the head of a security company -- all of which indicate the group is far from dismantled. The Gran Familia is also believed to operate with the help of corrupt police ."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Peru Transport Companies Worked With Extortionists. The number of investigations into transportation company managers accused of collaborating with extortion rings has more than doubled in north Peru's Lambayeque region since last year, say prosecutors, bringing to light a lesser-known aspect of a well-documented regional criminal activity. Carmen Miranda Vidaurre, head of the Lambayeque Prosecutors Council, said that this year 33 taxi and minibus companies and their managers are under investigation for charging fees to their employees in order to make payments to criminal groups running extortion rackets. In return for collecting the payments, the managers allegedly received a cut of the profits. Vidaurre noted that these same managers are also filing extortion complaints, reported RPP. According to regional prosecutor Juan Carrasco Millones, there were only 15 managers investigated in 2012. Carrasco said that there are 136 reports of extortion being investigated so far in 2013, and that five extortion rings have been dismantled. Notably, Carrasco has been accused by Peru's anti-extortion police division of failing to do enough to properly investigate extortion cases. Extortion has been an ongoing problem in Lambayeque, where Aurelio Angeles Bonilla, alias ""Viejo Paco"", who was arrested in December 2012 , formerly led a group of extortionists allegedly responsible for dozens of murders and kidnappings. As in Lambayeque, extortion of the transport sector is common in other Latin American countries such as Honduras, Guatemala, and Colombia, and has resulted in numerous homicides. However, it is less common to hear about how the managers of transport companies may be complicit in these extortion schemes. Some managers may sell intelligence about rival bus companies to extortion rings, in order to pressure the rival company to downsize and thus allow their competitors to move in and pick up the profits. Such scenarios are not unheard of in the region. In many cases, extortionists directly charge the drivers, a practice which led Guatemala to implement a cashless bus system. Meanwhile, in Honduras, extortion has caused 17,000 small companies to shut down in the past year."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Rising Extortion Signals Trouble For El Salvadors Gang Truce. Salvadoran police warn that extortion by gangs has risen since a nationwide truce between the MS-13 and Barrio 18 was brokered a year ago, raising concerns about the long term viability of the deal. Police sources consulted by newspaper El Diario de Hoy said while the number of reported extortions had dropped, the real figure seemed to have shot up, and that gang members were using new methods. Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 have agreed to stop extortion in designated ""peace zones"" in the next phase of the truce , but Justice and Security Minister David Munguia Payes admitted to El Diario de Hoy that extortion would not stop while unemployment remained high. Only 10 percent of extortion victims filed reports, said police investigators, while many stayed silent for fear of reprisals. Extortion payments were factored into company budgets, they said, citing the example of a business in Soyapango paying $27,000 a month to gangs. Children aged between 10 and 13 are often used as messengers, according to security advisers employed by businesses, who told the newspaper that they arrived with threatening notes or cellphones allowing gang members to talk directly with company managers. Police said the gangs made an average of 75 calls a day to potential victims, mostly from jail. Munguia told El Diario de Hoy that the fact that an agreement had not been reached with the gangs on extortion was one of the ""imperfections"" of the truce. ""The gangs have already said that they are not going to stop extorting, because that is how they make a living, at least until they have an alternative way of making money,"" said the minister. While El Salvador's gang truce has been widely lauded as a success, with homicides dropping more than 40 percent since it was agreed in 2012, there are questions over the viability of proposed new peace zones, and extortion is a major sticking point. As Munguia acknowledged, extortion is the main source of income for the gangs and as such will be difficult to eradicate. Gang leaders have agreed to stop all criminal activities in designated peace zones, four of which have been inaugurated so far , with another 10 planned, but the lack of clarity about how the zones will work in practice is a cause for concern. Both the government and gang leaders have made clear that extortion will not stop until there are more job opportunities for the gang members, but so far these have failed to materialize. The government has announced plans to give tens of thousands of gang members and ""at risk"" youth job training and opportunities with participating companies, but gang members have complained that so far authorities have not made good on their promises."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Amid Growing Role in Drug Trade, Argentina Sees Spike In Kidnappings. Kidnapping appears to be increasing in Argentina amidst a crime wave that could be a side effect of the country's growing domestic drug market and role as a drug transit nation. According to statistics from the Attorney General's Office accessed by La Nacion , 696 kidnappings were reported in Argentina between January 1 and September 30 this year. Of these, 201 -- just under 29 percent -- occurred in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. The majority of the kidnapping victims were chosen randomly and held hostage in vehicles rather than in safe houses, reported La Nacion. Express kidnappings in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area often start out as vehicle robberies, then morph into kidnappings if the driver is perceived as being wealthy. In one prominent case in July, the father of professional soccer player Carlos Tevez was kidnapped for five hours after a criminal group attempted to steal his vehicle and realized who he was. According to La Nacion, only a small number of kidnappings involve a criminal group that is deliberately targeting a specific individual. Some of the kidnapping groups that operate in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area employ sophisticated tactics , such as listening to police radio frequencies and taking precautions to keep their calls from being traced. Groups also transfer victims from one vehicle to another and keep them in constant movement to reduce the probability that security forces will be able to locate them. In addition to demanding cash ransoms, there have also been reports of kidnapping groups asking for weapons in exchange for a hostage's release. In some cases, the groups also force the victim to drive to his or her home so they can steal cash and valuables. Although the majority of the kidnappings reported in the 2014 figures are likely extortive kidnappings, the Attorney General's Office cautioned that some may be cases of ""virtual"" kidnappings -- in which a perpetrator calls up a victim and pretends to have kidnapped his or her family member -- mistakenly reported as extortive. As of May 2014, police were registering around 200 cases of virtual kidnappings a week in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. There have also been cases of virtual kidnappers using technology to make their claims seem more believable. Perpetrators have hacked into social media accounts or cell phones, and impersonated the ""victim"" in order to convince family and friends that a kidnapping has actually taken place. The high number of kidnappings in Argentina could be related to the country's booming domestic drug market and increasing role as a transit nation for drug shipments. Both of these factors have contributed to the rise of local criminal groups. In some cases, these gangs started out in the local drug trade, before moving into other criminal activities like extortion, money laundering, targeted assassinations -- and perhaps now kidnappings. Elsewhere in Latin America, Mexico has seen a similar pattern emerge. Last year, the country recorded its highest number of kidnappings ever -- 1,698 -- amid widespread drug war violence. This is partly due to the fragmentation of the larger drug cartels: the resulting splinter groups tend to look to other activities, like kidnapping, to earn funds, if they are no longer able to depend on transnational drug trafficking. Although Argentina's Attorney General's Office does not publish kidnapping statistics, the frequency of the crime does appear to be increasing in comparison with recent years. According to La Nacion, Buenos Aires saw 43 kidnappings reported in 2011, 31 in 2012, and 51 in 2013, compared to 70 cases investigated by federal prosecutors in the city and a total of 201 in the metropolitan area in just the first nine months of this year. In addition, a 2013 United Nations report on citizen security identifies Argentina as one of four countries in Latin America with the highest kidnapping rates. According to the US State Department , long-term kidnappings are rare in Argentina compared to express kidnappings. These are more common in the southern part of the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, while long-term kidnappings with higher ransoms are more typical further north. There may be other factors besides organized crime dynamics that have led to more kidnappings in Argentina. According to a security consultancy in Buenos Aires , middle-class victims have become more of a target for kidnappers following regulations limiting cash withdrawals, and a widespread distrust of banks that has led to a tendency to store large sums of cash in houses and apartments. Unlike in Mexico and Colombia, where kidnappings are often carried out by drug cartels and illegal armed groups, the criminal groups behind kidnappings in Argentina appear to be much smaller and less sophisticated. According to the book Kidnapping in Latin America , many kidnapping groups in Argentina started out in robberies, then moved on to kidnapping in the early 2000s. These groups often had ties to corrupt security forces, and police were implicated in several prominent kidnapping cases in the early 2000s, including three in which the victim was later found dead. The alleged collusion of security forces with kidnapping gangs eventually prompted former President Nestor Kirchner, who was elected in 2003, to order a review of the police force in the province of Buenos Aires."	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Kidnapping on the Rise in Colombia; Rebels Target Oil Workers. Kidnapping in Colombia went up 30 percent in the first half of 2011, according to the anti-kidnapping NGO Pais Libre , with numbers pushed up by rebel mass abductions of oil workers. In the year 2000, Colombia was the kidnapping capital of the world with more than 3,500 registered cases, and thousands more that were never reported. Under the Democratic Security Policy of President Alvaro Uribe (2002-2010), that number dropped exponentially, down to 213 in 2009. While there have been accusations of corruption within the state anti-kidnapping body, Fondelibertad, and perhaps manipulation of the numbers, there can be no doubt that kidnapping has fallen away to a fraction of the figures seen in 2000. However, a slight increase was seen in 2010, with 282 cases, and the trend for this year is up another 30 percent, the main driver behind this a sharp increase in rebel abductions, particularly of oil workers. The trend in 2009 and 2010 was that the Marxist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ) and the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN ) were no longer the principal kidnappers. Common criminals had overtaken the rebels as the main abductors and the kidnapping plague, long a rural phenomenon, was becoming urban. There were two main reasons behind the drop in rebel kidnappings. The first was that the guerrillas were pushed away from the principal urban centers and therefore the biggest pools of potential victims; the second was that, under constant threat of aerial bombardment and increased security force operations, the guerrillas had been forced to become totally mobile, seldom spending consecutive nights in the same place. Dragging around a kidnap victim, seldom in the same peak physical condition as the rebel fighters, became dangerous. In 2011, however, this trend is being reversed. The FARC have stepped up their kidnapping operations, on the orders of the rebel commander-in-chief alias "" Alfonso Cano "" (real name Guillermo Leon Saenz Vargas), as part of his new guerrilla strategy document Plan 2010. Their principal target is the oil industry. The first sign of this new rebel policy was seen in March, when the FARC's 16th Front kidnapped 23 oil workers on contract with the Canadian company Talisman Energy. They were taken in the remote eastern province of Vichada, on the border with Venezuela, home to coca crops and rebel drug export routes. All but one of the workers were released on the same day, with the final victim being liberated at the end of July. It is not known if any ransom was paid. Then in June three Chinese workers and their translator, working with the British firm Emerald Energy, were snatched from their vehicle in the southern province of Caqueta, long a rebel stronghold. It seems the rebels are demanding a three million dollar ransom for their release. Most recently, at the end of July, five workers on contract for the Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corporation were kidnapped in the department of Arauca on the Venezuela border. They were released a few days later , in a rebel operation which, sources told InSight Crime, was related to a failure to meet extortion demands. The FARC has combined the kidnapping of oil workers with an increase in attacks on oil and gas pipelines and energy infrastructure, suggesting that Cano's policy is designed to undermine the government's claim that it is now safe to invest in Colombia and thus deter foreign investment, which has been one of the major factors in boosting the economy. Oil production is also currently as record levels, with the government promising that output will soon exceed a million barrels a day. However it is not just the FARC that are engaging in mass kidnappings. The new generation of narco-paramilitary groups, called BACRIMs (""bandas criminals"" - criminal gangs) by the government, are also involved. In April, 10 people were taken by heavily armed men from a farm in Sopetran , in the northern province of Antioquia. As investigations into the kidnapping advanced, it became clear that those abducted had links to the drug trade, and it was believed that their abductions were related to an unpaid drug debt, or fighting between rival gangs linked to the Medellin mafia, the Oficina de Envigado. The bodies of those kidnapped were found towards the end of May in a mass grave not far from where they had been snatched, the corpses bearing signs of torture. Another factor feeding kidnapping this year is the fact that there are regional elections in October. There have already been at least three cases of local politicians being kidnapped, perhaps to pressure them into either withdrawing from the race, or promising to work with illegal factions should they win public office. What is clear is the kidnapping is again becoming a significant problem in Colombia, and yet another headache for President Juan Manuel Santos, already under pressure on the security front as the FARC increase actions across the country.
