"US Marijuana Vote Unlikely to Impact Mexico in Short Term. The passing of marijuana legalization ballots in Washington and Colorado raises the question of whether these measures will hit the profits of Mexican drug trafficking organizations. The two states became the first to legalize the recreational use of the drug in the United States. In Colorado, the ballot passed with 53 percent of the vote, with 47 percent against. In Washington, with 60 percent of the vote counted, the measure was passing with 55 percent to 44. The measures legalize personal possession of up to one ounce of marijuana, and allow the drug to be legally sold and taxed in licensed stores. A similar initiative failed to pass in Oregon, gaining less than 45 percent of the vote. A recent study by Mexican free trade think tank the Mexican Institute of Competitiveness (IMCO), (co-authored by analyst Alejandro Hope, an InSight Crime contributor) found that if the marijuana legalization ballots passed in Oregon, Washington, and Colorado, it could reduce the revenue of Mexican drug trafficking organizations by as much as 30 percent. But as Hope pointed out on Animal Politico , the impact of these measure will depend on the US federal government's response. Drug legalization activists -- and critics -- have expressed surprise that US Attorney General Eric Holder did not issue any strong statements opposing the marijuana legalization initiatives as the election approached. This was in marked contrast to the strongly worded statement Holder issued before California residents voted on Proposition 19 in 2010. So far, the response from the federal government remains muted: according to Reuters , the US Justice Department reacted to the measures by stating that its drug enforcement policy had not changed. As Hope argues, the consequences of these marijuana legalization measures depends on how quickly and vigorously federal authorities react. There are several things the federal government may now do, Hope states: try to overthrow the legalization measures in court, increase the number of federal anti-drug police in Washington and Colorado, or selectively persecute marijuana buyers, sellers, and distributors in these two states. Mexico, one of the major suppliers of marijuana to the US, is unlikely to feel the impact of these measures for a while. Parts of the Colorado measure will come into effect after 30 days, but the Washington measure will not take effect for a year. As John Walsh noted in commentary for the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), the legalization may have more symbolic than practical impact. The outcome of the vote is indicative of shifting attitudes towards marijuana prohibition in the US, for elected officials and citizens alike. ""Rather than considering marijuana policy reform as, at best, a topic to avoid, more politicians may see it in a new light -- as a potentially voter-friendly issue that spans the ideological spectrum,"" Walsh states. As Walsh sets out, the symbolic importance of this vote for drug legalization comes as other leaders across Latin America have called for alternative approaches to the current war on drugs. The presidents of Guatemala, Mexico, and Colombia emphasized the need for debate before the United Nations in October. Meanwhile, Uruguay and Chile have considered their own marijuana legalization bills. However, as InSight Crime has argued , even with marijuana now legalized in two US states, Mexico's criminal organizations have proved to be very adaptable in finding new sources of revenue. Criminal groups have already expanded their criminal activities to include methamphetamine, migrant smuggling, and even illegal mining. Even if the predictions of IMCO come to pass, and groups like the Sinaloa Cartel lose as much as half of their total income from drug trafficking, it will not be a fatal blow to Mexico's traffickers."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"The Expendables: The Weakest Links in the Drug Trafficking Chain. Drug traffickers are recruiting women by the hundreds to transport drugs from Bolivia to feed Chile's growing consumer market. They tempt impoverished, debt-ridden women, who are often the sole providers for their families, with offers of up to $1,000 to become ""tragonas"" (swallowers) or drug mules. And the countries' poor relations coupled with the high demand for drugs mean this problem will likely only continue to grow. Elena was 20 years old and raising two children aged one and three when she agreed to work as a tragona. Her youngest was still breastfeeding at the start of her trip in January 2018. She left her children with her brother, who was 17 and would have to care for their seven-year-old brother in addition to his niece and nephew. Their brother was the reason Elena took the job. *This article was originally published by Connectas. It was translated, edited for clarity and reprinted with permission, but does not necessarily reflect the views of InSight Crime. See the original version in Spanish here. ""I agreed to take the capsules because of the money. I needed it to buy a valve for my brother, who had severe malnutrition and couldn't feed normally because of a congenital brain malformation,"" she said. Like most women whom drug traffickers use as human couriers, Elena is a single mother from the central Bolivian city of Cochabamba. At the time, she was earning 600 bolivianos (approximately $87) a month cleaning houses part-time. The traffickers promised her $1,000 to make the trip, the equivalent of 3.3 minimum monthly salaries in Bolivia and more than 10 times her own salary. ""They offered [the job] to me on the bus. I ran into a man from my hometown. He offered it to me. He said, 'I do that kind of work. If you want, I'll get you a job,' and he gave me a number. He was older, and I had known him since I was a girl. I don't know [if recruiting women was his job], but I believe so. I thought about it for three weeks, but he would pressure me, call me, ask me if I would accept the job. 'Will you take it?' And in the end, I accepted it because I needed to. I needed to do it for my brother."" *** After her husband left, Celia Casorla lost custody of her children, and her problems with alcohol started. She also lost the motorcycle she used for her work as a taxi driver in Cochabamba. ""I felt bad. Empty. I needed my children. They didn't want to talk to me. They ignored my calls, and I got into drinking. I drank and drank and drank for a whole year. The next year the debts piled up. It got to the point where I couldn't pay my rent. I just drank."" Celia heard that she could earn good money as a mule, so one day she decided to contact a trafficker. She went to Cochabamba's slums, asking, ""Do you know anyone who works with Dona Blanca?"" Until she met a man who offered her her first ""contract."" The drug trafficker took Celia to the Bolivian town of Pisiga, on the border with Chile. They made her swallow the capsules there. ""I couldn't do it. I swear. It made me vomit. I couldn't swallow it. It hurts your throat. And what did I say [to myself]? Since I couldn't give anything to my children and I spent my time drinking, I would do it for my children, if for nothing else then for my children. Every time I couldn't do it, I had to remember that. You know how to drink alcohol? Well, take this. And I took it. I couldn't take it all, though. I still had about a quarter of a kilogram left. I couldn't do it, and I told the guy, 'Even if you don't pay me for all of it, even half will help me, but I'm not going to take any more [capsules]. I can't. My body doesn't want it. I do, but my body doesn't. What do you want me to do?' 'Okay,' he said, 'Let's go, then.'"" A kilogram of pure cocaine costs about $2,200 in Bolivia. The tragonas -- who swallow capsules full of the drug -- and mules -- who smuggle it in their luggage or in strips attached to their bodies -- are paid $1,500 to carry that kilogram from Bolivia to Santiago de Chile. There, it is sold at $15 per gram, a profit for the drug traffickers of $15,000 per kilogram. But that is if they are selling pure cocaine; most of the time it is mixed with other substances like plaster of Paris or talcum powder to make even more money. Statements the women gave in court proceedings in Chile have revealed that mafia guards sometimes accompany the transporters on the bus. In other instances, the traffickers take a picture of them at the bus terminal when they board and give them an old cell phone. When the transporter arrives at her destination, someone is there to pick her up and take her to a safe house. 30-year-old C.P.H. served a one-year prison sentence in Chile before being expelled from the country. In an excerpt from her court statement, she says, ""I went to Oruro [in Bolivia] to buy fabric. A woman approached me and offered me a job transporting drugs to Iquique [in Chile]. They would wait for me at the terminal and pay me $300. The woman took a picture to remember what I looked like. I had to deliver the package to the same person at the terminal in Iquique."" ""I met a woman named Margarita in the Iquique terminal who gave me $1,000 and '100 chileans' to take four packages of drugs to Calama. She bought the tickets, was waiting for me at the Calama terminal and took my picture with her cell phone,"" according to a statement from E.R.L., 38 years old and sentenced to five years and one day of prison. *** Francisca Fernandez is an anthropologist and expert with the Public Defender's Office (Defensoria Penal Publica - DPP), which had her conduct a study on the profiles of the foreign indigenous women serving prison sentences in the north of the country. For months she visited prisons and interviewed incarcerated women, mostly from Bolivia. In Fernandez's opinion, gangs treat the women like disposable materials. ""Three women are sitting together on a bus wearing the same new, white, high-heeled shoes. Obviously, they're going to be searched,"" the anthropologist says. She believes they were planted to divert the police officers' attention while an even larger shipment was smuggled in. Fernandez found that in several cases the setup was handled so crudely it was as if someone wanted the transporters to be discovered. The DPP believes it is possible that gangs are using poor people to concentrate police efforts in one place while they smuggle larger amounts of drugs in another. It is also entertaining the possibility that criminal groups are using a strategy known as the ""False 22,"" which refers to an article in Chile's anti-drug trafficking law that allows for compensated cooperation. Drug traffickers use the law to get their sentences reduced. A false 22 is a person who was hired to carry drugs without knowing that an already imprisoned drug trafficker will report it to the authorities in exchange for benefits from the law. The DPP has documented numerous cases of false 22s, such as one involving a farmer from Oruro who could only speak Quechua fluently and who was loaded with drugs in a hostel in the Chilean port city of Antofagasta. He was imprisoned for nine months. Another case is one of the few involving a repeat offender. A Quechua woman has been in a Chilean prison for four years now serving a drug trafficking sentence, and according to the documents on her case, she has an intellectual disability and cannot read. Authorities discovered her smuggling drugs for the second time in 2014, at the customs checkpoint in Chile's El Loa province. She had been traveling by bus, and because her first arrest occurred at the same checkpoint an official recognized her. She had hidden the cocaine in an electric pizza oven. It is impossible to prove whether such cases are intentional distractions or not. But one thing is certain: so many women are arrested and so many drugs are confiscated that, if traffickers are still willing to go the route of tragonas and mules to send drugs south, it is because they are profiting enormously from it despite the arrests. At the regional public defender's office in Tarapaca, where the number of Bolivians arrested for drug trafficking is highest, research head Gabriel Carrion argues that Chile's criminal policy does not focus on the owners of the drugs but on the minor players, who are disposable and hold no real power. ""Prosecutors are practical about their choice: they go after the ones carrying the drugs. And if you ask them about the people who own the drugs, they say it's not in their jurisdiction because an international investigation would have to be carried out."" While both the Chilean and Bolivian police have stated that they exchange information collected from the arrests of tragonas and mules, the attorney general's office in Tarapaca acknowledged that no binational investigations have been carried out. Regional prosecutor Raul Arancibia said, ""To date in the region we haven't had drug trafficking investigations in which we worked with the Bolivian Attorney General's Office."" The bad blood between Chile and Bolivia goes back centuries, but the wounds are still fresh. Bolivia lost its territory on the Pacific coast to Chile in 19th-century War of the Pacific, and despite sharing a border 850 kilometers long, the two countries have not maintained diplomatic relations for the past 40 years. In March 1978 they withdrew their ambassadors, and four years ago Bolivia filed a claim with the International Court of Justice in The Hague to force Chile to the negotiating table about restoring Bolivia's access to the sea. The two countries scheduled a meeting on September 5 to discuss border issues, including efforts to combat drug trafficking, but Chile suspended it two days prior, claiming the conditions for the talks had not been met. One month later, on October 1, The Hague ruled against Bolivia on the issue. Since then, the leaders of both countries have been taking jabs at each other via social networks and the media, and no one has mentioned a bilateral agenda. *** Simply being a Bolivian passenger on a bus in Chile causes suspicion and therefore ups the chances that the police will search you. Maria Avendano was stuck in a Chilean jail for two and a half years before she was acquitted. In 2007 she as arrested on a bus near the border while she was traveling with her adult son. She was accused of owning a suitcase carrying men's overalls and 23 kilograms of cocaine. When the police found the suitcase in a routine search, they asked the bus attendant who it belonged to. He told them it belonged to Maria. She denied it. They did not believe her, and she was arrested. According to the DPP, this case is an example of poor police work and police officers allowing prejudice to influence them. ""They didn't lift any fingerprints or DNA samples from the luggage to tie the suspect to it,"" the office explained in a document titled ""The Innocence Project"" (Proyecto Inocentes), which recounts the stories of people who were erroneously jailed in Chile. The police let Maria's son, a doctor, go free. But he had to stay in Chile to be near his mother. He worked in a pharmacy for two and half years before her trial and aquittal. *** According to figures from the Tarapaca public defender's office, 58% of the 180 Bolivian women sentenced in 2017 were indigenous. Most were sent to the prison in the city of Alto Hospicio, 230 kilometers from the Bolivian border. Alto Hospicio is one of Chile's poorest cities, ranking at number 76 out of 90 on the Urban Quality of Life Index managed by the Catholic University of Chile. The city was founded a series of land grabs in the upper area of another city -- Iquique -- and the two are connected by a lone road that snakes through the Cordillera de la Costa, the country's coastal mountain range. Unlike Iquique, Alto Hospicio is not a tourist destination but an industrial city. Despite the rugged landscape, Bolivian women who arrive at the prison have some advantages compared to those sent to other prisons. First, there are more incarcerated Bolivians here than any other nationality, including Chilean, which means less discrimination from fellow inmates. ""They create compatriot communities,"" said Gabriel Carrion, a lawyer with the DPP. Another advantage is that the office created a specialized indigenous defense unit in Tarapaca, which provides interpreters in certain cases when the women do not speak Spanish. Carrion, himself a Bolivian, explained that his office had to hire a specialized defense attorney and an intercultural facilitator. Both actions have helped to give the women access to the information they need and reduce case processing times. ""The Bolivian women generally follow the rules. They're low profile, so much so that sometimes the violations go unnoticed,"" he said. *** When the authorities detained Elena, they took her to a container in front of the emergency unit of the Iquique regional hospital. She spent two nights there, passing the capsules. She must have been sitting on a bench the entire time because the container did not have any stretchers to lie on. The authorities only gave her water and soup, no solids, which prevents the capsules from getting too dirty. ""It's not just unpleasant for the detainees to be there,"" said one policeman, ""You have to take the capsules out of the toilet with gloves and wash them off. It smells horrible inside, especially when it's really hot."" While in the container, Elena saw four other detainees come and go, three men and one woman. All of them were Bolivians. After she passed the last capsule, the authorities told Elena that she had the right to notify the Bolivian consulate of her situation so her family in Bolivia could be notified. Like most Bolivian citizens who get arrested in Chile, she opted not to. She had no visits or phone calls with them during the months she spent in Chilean prison. ""I asked the consulate not to tell my family. They would want to come, and I knew they didn't have the money for it. That money was for my children and brother."" Eventually, Elena received news from a single family member. ""I got a letter from Bolivia. A woman delivered it to me. I had sent a letter to her daughter. Her daughter spoke with my sister, and my sister sent me a letter with some money. She's my older sister. In the letter she said that my younger brother, the one with the health condition, had died. [I was in prison] when I found out that my children were with her and my other brother too. My brother [who was ill] was like a son to me. He died on July 2."" *This article was originally published by Connectas.

"El Salvador Gangs Confirm Truce. Representatives of the rival MS-13 and Barrio-18 gangs in El Salvador have confirmed the existence of a truce between them, negotiated with the help of the Church. Raul Mijango, a former congressman who says he acted as a mediator in talks between jailed leaders of the two groups, released a document Thursday written in the name of ""the national spokespeople"" of the Mara Salvatrucha 13 ( MS-13 ) and Barrio 18. The document says that the group does not ""wish to keep making war,"" and that it has undertaken peace talks: Since last year we have begun internally a deep process of reflection and analysis of the serious and pressing problems facing our country, of which we have been part, as a consequence of the war that we have been forced to fight due to social exclusion, marginalization, repression, and the need for survival We have not negotiated anything with this government, nor do we ask to, we are tired of corrupt and lying politicians that's why this time to accompany our process of reflection we preferred to ask for the assistance of the Church and civil society They have made it possible that after 20 years we have been able to reach an agreement between the two rival gangs where we have managed to significantly reduce the murders in the country, and, in a gesture of goodwill, to cancel all actions that include attacks against soldiers, police and guards. The statement has criticism for website El Faro, which last week broke the story of a possible deal between the gangs and the government, saying it had made ""perverse and false allegations."" The website's sources said that the government had transferred 30 gang members to lower security prisons in exchange for a reduction in violence -- murders dropped by 53 percent in the week after the transfers, compared to the average in the first 12 weeks of the year. The existence of a deal was flatly denied by the government, which said its security policies were to thank for the reduction in crime, before a bishop announced days later that he had brokered a truce between the rival groups, with the knowledge of the government. El Diario de Hoy reports that on Thursday, after the document was released, it visited imprisoned gang members, including some of the leaders who were transferred. The newspaper says that all the pandilleros they spoke to, 25 from MS-13 and 18 from Barrio-18, confirmed that the document was genuine and reflected their policies. Representatives of both groups said they had not negotiated with the government, and were not seeking to do so. El Diario de Hoy presents strong evidence for the theory that the drop in violence is the result of an inter-gang truce rather than a government deal. However, doubts remain. The government has not been able to adequately explain the transfer of the 30 imprisoned leaders, while prison director Nelson Rauda admitted to El Faro that the move had been part of a strategy to bring down violence, and said that the leaders' promise to lower violence had been ""a factor"" in the move. A former national police chief told media Tuesday that it was obvious that the transfer must have involved a negotiation with the authorities. (Image, above, from El Diario de Hoy, shows MS-13 members ""El Diablo,"" ""El Sirra,"" and ""Tiberio"" holding the document.) "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"UN Details How Cheap Cocaine Base Plagues South America. A new United Nations report into the use and sale of cocaine base in Peru traces the rise of a drug that has blighted communities around South America, but has become a boon to drug traffickers and criminal groups. Cocaine base is the paste produced during the first stage of cocaine production, and is usually later processed into powder, cocaine hydrochloride (HCL). However, when smoked, base is also a highly addictive and destructive drug. According to a new United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report [ pdf ], the first recorded consumption of cocaine base in Peru dates back to the early 1970s, although researchers believe it was commonly consumed in certain parts of the country up to 15 years before. By 1980, the drug had spread to the cities, although to this day, usage remains higher in many rural areas than in Lima and other cities. In 1992, a Peruvian non-profit that monitors drug abuse, known as CEDRO, stated that 5.6 percent of the population had tried cocaine base, a record at the time. This was followed by a general downward trend until 2005, when use stabilized at between 2.1 and 3.7 percent. According to the UNODC, there are many explanations accounting for this drop in consumption, including changing perceptions of the risks of using cocaine base and the growing popularity of synthetic drugs in Peru. The latest study in cocaine base consumption, published in 2012 by national anti-drug agency DEVIDA, found that only 1.5 percent of the population had tried base but that this number had increased significantly since 2006. The DEVIDA study also suggested that nearly 60 percent of people who had smoked base in the previous year showed signs of dependency. The UNODC attributed this dramatic increase to the rising number of chronic users, the low price of the drug, and its increased production and availability. Cocaine base is mostly produced in Peru's coca growing regions, principally the area known as the VRAE , although labs have also been discovered on the edge of Lima and other coastal cities. Product for domestic use is smuggled into the cities in heavy goods vehicles and delivered to suppliers, who usually handle two to four kilos at a time. The suppliers then distribute the base to dealers, who are often users themselves, and usually handle quantities no bigger than tens of grams. A 2012 CEDRO study identified 1,350 sites where base is sold in the cities of Lima and Callao alone. According to the UNODC, the Peruvian trade is not controlled by organized criminal groups and thus operates as a relatively open market, in which independent drug dealers may participate with little fear of violent reprisals. Internationally trafficked cocaine base leaves Peru by several routes and is usually destined for domestic markets in Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay. In recent years, greater amounts of cocaine base has been trafficked via southern routes. This is most likely due to growing demand for cocaine base in Brazil , where it is not only smoked as a paste but is also used to produce crack, which was previously only made with cocaine HCL. Much of the Peruvian base destined for Brazil does not cross the countries' shared border but instead is trafficked through Bolivia. Cocaine base is much easier and cheaper to produce than cocaine hydrochloride. The precursor chemicals used, such as petrol and cement, are cheaper and easier to obtain than the chemicals needed to process HCL. Additionally, the process requires much less expertise and can be carried out in rudimentary laboratories close to where coca is grown. The end product is a paste containing a high concentration of cocaine mixed with impurities. Crucially, unlike powdered cocaine, it is smokeable and thus delivers a much more intense but brief high. This is what makes base far more addictive than cocaine HCL, as users are quickly locked into a cycle of short, sharp highs followed by a craving for more, the intensity of which is proportional to the intensity of the high. The impact on users' health can be brutally destructive both physically and mentally -- and devastating to families and communities. In the hands of enterprising traffickers, who understood that the drug's lower sale price could be offset by its low production cost and the high demand from consumers, the sale of cocaine base for consumption has spread through South America. The low price of base has made it ideal for marketing in economically deprived areas and its impact has been especially devastating in South America's urban slums. The spread of base in these areas has not just caused health and social problems, it has also generated a new, lucrative source of income for the violent street gangs that typically control street level drug dealing. The Southern Cone nations have been especially hard-hit. According to the Argentine government , use of cocaine base, or ""paco,"" rose 200 percent between 2001 and 2005. Many analysts associate this increase with the poverty and lack of opportunity that followed the country's 2001 economic crash. Use in Brazil has also spread quickly in that time, culminating in a media frenzy in 2011 over ""Oxi""- ostensibly a new and shockingly dangerous cocaine derivative, in reality little more than rebranded base. It is arguable that the spread of base consumption in South America is a direct consequence of law enforcement efforts to clamp down on the cocaine trade. Tighter restrictions on precursor chemicals , as well as the focus on interdicting drug shipments destined for overseas markets, has made it costlier and riskier for South America-based drug trafficking organizations to process cocaine HCL and move it to the United States and Europe. As a result, the quick and easy option of dumping base into the South American domestic market has become an ever more attractive option. As a health issue, cocaine base use is among the most difficult addictions to treat, in terms of breaking dependency and in ensuring there is no relapse. As an organized crime issue, the relative ease with which it is produced and trafficked means it is likely to prove similarly difficult to tackle. Even more worryingly, any successes in tackling the international cocaine trade could well lead to the problem spreading and deepening throughout South America as squeezed drug traffickers opt for the easy dollar."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexican Activist Slain While Protesting Daughters Murder. Activist Marisela Escobedo, 52, was shot and killed while demanding justice for her daughter's murder in Chihuahua City on December 19, 2010. In an alarming indicator of the level of impunity in that state, Escobedo was shot at 8:00pm on a busy street in front of the Government Palace, the office of Chihuahua's governor. Below is the footage of the act, captured by a security camera across the street and narrated by Mexico City's La Reforma news agency. After the August 2008 murder of her 16-year-old daughter, Rubi Marisol Frayre Escobedo, Ms. Escobedo became a leading activist for judicial reform in the country. Despite the fact that her daughter's boyfriend confessed to the crime and took police to the location where he burned the body, a judge released him. Recently, an appellate court convicted him of the murder charges, but he remains at large. Escobedo was at the Government Palace carrying a sign protesting the fact that a recent case involving the murder of Chihuahua's governor, Cesar Duarte, was resolved in four months and resulted in a sentence in less than a week of trial. The sign allegedly read: ""Justice: the privilege of the governor. And for my daughter, when?"" "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Medellin Sees Murders Rise After Years of Declining Violence. Hillside gangs quick to settle scores have been blamed for an increase in killings in the Colombian city of Medellin, yet changes in the city's underworld are behind the rising body count. In 2018, Medellin tallied 626 homicides, a 7.6 percent increase from the prior year. Battles among criminal groups were responsible for more than half the murders, El Tiempo reported. Much of the bloodshed occurred in Comuna 13, a district on the western outskirts of the city that saw the largest jump in homicides, from 48 in 2017 to 91 last year. Neighborhood gangs, known as combos, battled it out on the steep hills overlooking the city in an effort to control local extortion rings and drug sales. Colombia's second-largest city had seen homicides decline for several straight years. In 2015, it recorded 496 murders, the lowest tally in decades. But killings have ticked up since. Colombia's top prosecutor Claudia Carrasquilla said Medellin's increase in homicides was spurred by the capture of leaders of the Oficina de Envigado, a coalition that controls the majority of criminal activity in Medellin. ""This has generated a realignment in the different organizations for territorial control,"" Carrasquilla said in an interview with El Tiempo. Though neighborhood gangs were responsible for last year's rash of killings in Medellin, their conflicts were fueled with guns and drugs provided by factions of the more powerful Oficina de Envigado. The ""Oficina,"" as it is known locally, has become erratic due to fragmentation and no longer operates as a top-down entity but rather harbors various leaders, shifting alliances and different factions, which are often at odds and find support from outside criminal groups. Homicides in Medellin have plunged in the three decades since drug cartels, right-wing paramilitaries, left-wing guerrillas and other criminal groups fought brutal wars in the streets, gaining the city a reputation as the world's most dangerous in the 1990s. In the aftermath, the Oficina de Envigado -- a conglomerate of criminal groups who were once debt collectors for Pablo Escobar -- rose to power. From 2003 to 2008, its various criminal structures, including some 120 combos, were under the control of Diego Murillo Bejarano, alias "" Don Berna ,"" who kept killings to a minimum. His capture and subsequent extradition, however, led to the city's homicide rate tripling as different leaders fought for control of the ""Oficina."" The next major drop in homicides came amid a truce among the remaining factions of the Oficina de Envigado and the Urabenos, Colombia's most powerful drug trafficking organization, which had tried to violently take over the city. Innovative approaches to security policy -- both on the part of policymakers as well as average citizens -- also played a part in the decrease in violence. The truce, however, never came close to providing the stability that Don Berna had. Since then, killings in the city have largely resulted from combos battling it out -- sometimes as proxies for factions of the Oficina de Envigado, the Urabenos , and other criminal structures. Some combos also act as independent operators. This is what is playing out in Comuna 13, the sprawling hillside district that has struggled for decades with violence but has also become a destination for tourists , attracting visitors to its graffiti art and outdoor escalators. At least four combos in conflict are behind the killings there. Two are historic rivals; the other two are allies turned foes. Others may also be in the mix. Powerful criminal groups, mostly splintered off from the original Oficina de Envigado, have sought to escalate these battles, feeding weapons and money to the combos in an effort to control the city's western frontier, including the San Juan highway. The highway, which leads to northern Antioquia and the Uraba coast, is a strategic corridor for moving drugs, cash, and guns. Andres Tobon, Medellin's security secretary, told InSight Crime that organized crime within the city is in ""disarray,"" and that has led to the killings. ""There is a rupture not only locally,"" Tobon said, ""but also in the hierarchy."" One of the leaders of the Oficina de Envigado, alias Ocho, agreed that captures have led to more violence, saying in an interview with El Tiempo that the new bosses ""have less control over their (criminal) structures."" The comuna's residents, meanwhile, suffer the fallout as the killings continue. In the first two weeks of January, Medellin saw 24 homicides , 16 more than the previous year."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Organized Crime Dominates in Mexicos Most Violent Cities. Many of Mexico's most violent cities are home to competing criminal groups and drug-fueled conflicts, a clear sign of how organized crime is contributing to the country's worsening security situation. The seven most violent cities in Mexico with a population of more than 100,000 are all in the states of either Colima or Guerrero, according to official figures collated by Animal Politico. Both of these states currently serve as battlegrounds between rival cartels. Cities in states like Michoacan (Apatzingan, Zamora, Lazaro Cardenas), Veracruz (Tierra Blanca, Papantla, Poza Rica de Hidalgo), Tamaulipas (Ciudad Victoria), Baja California (Playas de Rosarito, Tijuana, Tecate) and Sinaloa (Culiacan, Navolato, Mazatlan), which also have a high presence of criminal groups and illicit activity, are included as well in Animal Politico's list of the country?s 50 most violent cities. Some of the the worst-offending cities, however, share a state with Mexico?s least violent cities -- Metepec and San Felipe de Progreso in the state of Mexico, for example, and San Andres Tuxtla in Veracruz. Despite claims by Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to the contrary , homicides in Mexico have been on the rise since early 2016 and are now back to highs not seen since 2012. More homicides were officially reported in July this year than during any other month of Pena Nieto's term. There were 2,073 homicides that month, according to the National Public Security System ( Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Publica - SNSP ). July's homicides bring the 2016 total to 12,376, a 16 percent increase over the same period a year earlier. Animal Politico's ranking is further evidence that the Mexican government is losing in its battle against organized crime , with the country?s security institutions incapable of reining in violence perpetrated by and between criminal groups. Tecoman and Manzanillo in Colima, two of the three most violent cities in Mexico, are both battlegrounds likely due to the port of Manzanillo, an important arrival point for the precursors needed for the production of methamphetamine. Violence in the state of Colima as a whole has soared this year , and according to security analyst Alejandro Hope, is currently the front line of a war for control between the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels. The tiny state is sandwiched between two other violent entities -- Jalisco and Michoacan, where only recently a state police helicopter was shot down by a criminal group, possibly the Knights Templar. Mexican authorities have made significant advances in battling the Knights Templar in Michoacan, as well as neutralizing a vigilante uprising turned nasty by transforming them into a Rural Defense Force. But that force has since been disbanded , and recent events point to an uptick in violence and a possible comeback for the Knights Templar. As for Acapulco, Guerrero -- one of the most violent cities in the world, not just Mexico -- rivalries between dozens of gangs has for years seen murders happen on the beaches and boardwalks of one of Mexico?s tourism jewels. Criminal groups in Acapulco have fragmented, in part due to the weakening of the Beltran Leyva Organization. Authorities think that there could be as many as 50 different criminal groups operating across the state, which is the epicenter of poppy production in Mexico. This list also shows how violence in Mexico isn?t generalized, but rather focused in specific regions and even sub-regions, which explains why in the same state -- such as Veracruz and the state of Mexico -- some cities can be plagued by violence while others are considered to be among the safest in the country.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Bolivia, Peru Cocaine Figures Show Colombia Driving Andean Boom. Newly released data on coca cultivation and cocaine production in Bolivia and Peru shows little significant change from last year, reinforcing the notion that booming production in Colombia is the primary factor driving an increase in the amount of the drug on the world market. On August 25, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) released its estimates of coca cultivation and cocaine production in Bolivia and Peru in 2016. Bolivia experienced a 3 percent increase in coca cultivation, up from 36,500 hectares in 2015 to 37,500 hectares in 2016. And estimated cocaine production increased by 8 percent, from 255 metric tons in 2015 to 275 metric tons in 2016, according to an ONDCP press release. Coca cultivation in Peru decreased considerably between 2015 and 2016, falling 17 percent from 53,000 hectares to 44,000 hectares. But cocaine production potential remained consistent at 410 metric tons between 2015 and 2016. According to the ONDCP, the drop in coca cultivation in Peru in 2016 can be attributed to the Peruvian government's stepped up coca eradication efforts in 2015. As for the consistency in potential cocaine production, the ONDCP said that an 18 percent increase in ""coca crop maturity"" allowed for this stability despite fewer hectares of coca cultivation. While coca cultivation and cocaine production in Bolivia and Peru has remained relatively stable, the Andean region -- which grows nearly all of the world's coca -- is still awash with the drug largely due to record production in Colombia. Colombia is producing more cocaine than ever before. Annual cocaine production rose 34 percent to 866 metric tons in 2016, while the number of hectares of coca under cultivation increased by 52 percent, from 96,000 hectares in 2015 to 146,000 hectares in 2016. For years, Colombia has attempted to control coca cultivation through crop eradication. The country has at times combined these efforts with crop substitution programs, though these have often failed to provide adequate security measures or sustainable alternatives, giving farmers little incentive to stop coca cultivation and production. And there appears to be a market for Colombia's surging production of one of the world's most popular drugs. The United States -- the world's top cocaine consumer -- is seeing an increase in the number of cocaine users, according to the latest National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2015. Between 2011 and 2015, the estimated number of cocaine users in the United States rose 37 percent, from 1.369 million users to 1.876 million users."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Youth in LatAm Increasingly Perpetrators, Victims of Violent Crime. Youth and minors are responsible for a rising percentage of violent crimes in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. They are also increasingly victimized in places such as Honduras and Argentina. The trends are region wide and troubling on many levels. In Colombia, children and adolescents below 18 years old represented 11 percent of all arrests made last year, with the 29,943 arrests reported by police in 2013 representing a 33 percent rise compared to 2010, reported El Tiempo. Nearly a third of the minors, 8,222, were arrested for stealing. However, youth crimes also included homicide and extortion. Cali headed the cities for youth murders, with 87 of 409 youths arrested facing homicide charges, while Medellin led in extortion, and Bogota in theft. In Mexico, the Interior Ministry (SEGOB) recently reported that youth are now the population most likely to be both victims and perpetrators of violence, reported El Economista. In 2013, 33.5 percent of homicides were committed by people aged 25 or younger. Meanwhile, the rate of homicide victims below the age of 18 increased more than 70 percent between 2006 and 2010 -- from 2.1 to 3.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. A third case highlights a different side of the problem: youth exposure to violence. In San Pedro Sula, Honduras, some 3,000 girls between the ages of 12 and 17 work as child prostitutes; another 5,000 under the age of 18 sleep on the streets, according to a report by the Honduran Institute of Childhood and Family accessed by La Prensa. According to the report, 3 out of 10 of these children become members of the country's violent street gangs, popularly known as ""maras."" According to Gema Santamaria, the senior advisor on the recent Latin American development report published by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP - pdf ), youth homicides are one of the best indicators of youth involvement in crime available, as it is those involved with drug gangs and other criminal groups who are most likely to be murder victims. Young males lead the charge. Between 1996 and 2009, around 20 percent of all murder victims in Latin America were males aged 20 to 24, while males aged 15 to 29 made up nearly half of all homicide victims, reported the UNDP. Young women and girls are usually victims of distinct forms of violence, particularly that which is associated with human trafficking and forced prostitution, or ""femicide"" -- the targeted killing of a woman because of her gender. Mexico's war against criminal groups has led to a spike in homicides since 2007 among both females and males , according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Males aged 20 to 24 have been some of the most affected, with the murder rate rising from around 20 per 100,000 to nearly 60 per 100,000 by 2009. Youth from 15 to 19 have also seen a sharp rise in murders, from around 10 per 100,000 to nearly 30 per 100,000 in the same time period. In Colombia, the youth homicide rate is among the five highest in the world, standing at 73.4 per 100,000 according to the UNDP. The country's overall homicide rate is less than half of that, standing at slightly over 30 per 100,000 in 2012. Youth homicide rates are also particularly high in El Salvador -- 92.3 per 100,000 in 2011 -- where the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) gangs have a particularly strong presence. Last year, a representative of children's rights body UNICEF said the majority of children and adolescents killed between 2005 and 2011 were gang members and had dropped out of school. As with criminal actors in Mexico and Colombia, the maras have been known to actively recruit children and, in some cases, force them to join. Elsewhere in the region, other countries are starting to display similar tendencies, as organized crime gains a stronger foothold. In Argentina, 545 adolescents were murdered in 2011 -- the highest number since 2003. Meanwhile, in Brazil the homicide rate for people aged 19 and younger rose 346 percent between 1980 and 2010. In both countries, these spikes have coincided with the evolution and spread of the local drug trade. Youth crime is far from a new phenomenon in Latin America where income disparities, urban shifts, and social exclusion have long led young people to commit what the UNDP refers to as ""aspirational crimes."" These include theft and other crimes aimed at gaining money and status. There are many factors that help contribute to youth involvement in crime and their susceptibility to violence in the region. Among the risk factors are social problems of the kind affecting the San Pedro Sula street children: coming from an impoverished background, with low literacy and little schooling; feeling socially excluded and bereft of opportunities. Over 30 percent of prisoners interviewed by the UNDP in Argentina, Peru, Mexico, El Salvador and Chile left their homes before the age of 15, and over 80 percent failed to complete high school. However, these factors alone are not enough to explain youth involvement in crime, and particularly violent crime. Santamaria told InSight Crime that the involvement of youth in violent crime in the region is increasing, particularly in places where criminal organizations have a strong presence. ""The use of violence [in crime] is becoming more prevalent, and youth are particularly susceptible to being involved in these types of activities, particularly in the case of organized crime,"" Santamaria told InSight Crime. ""The difference is the way in which organized crime manifests itself in these countries in places like Mexico, organized crime has managed to escalate to an extent that it doesn't only corrupt the system, but it also uses violence to compete with other criminal organizations, and that's what makes youth more vulnerable,"" said Santamaria. Santamaria's assessment may help explain why youth violence tends to be concentrated in certain countries and cities. Take the case of Cali, Colombia. As the Urabenos and Rastrojos criminal groups fought for power over the city, the two groups co-opted numerous teens into service. According to officials, the number of gangs in the city grew more than 10-fold between 1992 and 2012, with over 2,000 youth involved in Cali gangs by 2013. The phenomenon of child involvement in criminal organizations has long existed in Colombia. Criminal organizations and guerrillas like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) recruit by offering food, a livelihood and a uniform to children as young as nine who have little else in the way of opportunities. Both also engage in forced recruitment. In Mexico, minors have also long been used by criminal groups to traffic drugs, carry out surveillance operations, and work as assassins. They are considered cheap, expendable and plentiful labor , with so-called ""ni-nis"" (youths who neither work nor study) numbering as many as eight million in Mexico in 2012. They make ready foot soldiers for gangs and cartels , and as such are also frequent targets of violence, as SEGOB highlighted. While easy targets, children are not always willing recruits, with organized crime often resorting to coercion to push them into criminality. Another benefit for criminal groups is that minors involved in violent crime often face much lighter sentences than their adult counterparts. They are also less likely to be suspected, and can thus pass undetected in places where others might not. Though the phenomenon of youth crime is well-documented, governments have not yet figured out what to do about it. In some countries in the region there is debate over whether to stiffen penalties for youth who commit crimes. However, this strategy targets the symptom when the overarching problem is a lack of social, educational and economic opportunities coupled with the presence of organized criminal actors. What's more, so-called ""mano dura"" (iron fist) or hard line policies against gang members, in which thousands of youth are rounded up based on physical appearance, have been shown to have a perverse effect on violence, turning prisons into breeding grounds for criminality, organized crime and street gangs. In Mexico, strategies aimed at providing youth with skills and employment opportunities, through combined private and public sector efforts, have been shown to have some effect in reducing the attraction of gangs for youth. However, as Santamaria explained to InSight Crime, strategies aimed at reducing youth crime will ultimately need to be differentiated to target the unique situation of each country, taking into account the makeup of organized crime and the principal social factors leading children to participate in criminality, in order for them to be effective."	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
"El Salvador Gang Leaders Keen to Maintain Faltering Truce. Six gangs in El Salvador have announced they wish to continue a two-year old truce during the new presidential term, raising the question: what do the gangs have to gain from maintaining a seemingly unraveling agreement? Spokespeople of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13), Barrio 18, the Mao Mao, Maquina, Mirada Locos 13 and Privadas y Privados de Libertad de Origen Comun said in a press release issued to local media they would like to continue what is really only a partial cease fire. The statement, dated March 9, came two years after the MS13 and the Barrio 18 began the truce, which led to a drastic drop in homicides in the country. In the statement, the gangs sent their congratulations to president-elect Salvador Sanchez Ceren of the ruling Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), which is a former guerrilla organization, and stated: ""If you will allow us, we would like to continue being part of the solution to the problem of violence affecting this country."" The gangs claimed the truce had saved 5,539 lives, led to an 18 percent drop in extortion rates, and resulted in the voluntary surrender of 504 arms to authorities. The claim does not coincide with official statistics. Sanchez Ceren was pronounced the winner of El Salvador's presidential elections following an extremely tight race. He will be sworn into office on June 1. The gang truce, which was secretly negotiated by the outgoing government of Mauricio Funes , initially led to an over 50 percent drop in homicides from an average of 14 to 6.8 per day. However, since mid-2013, murders have been steadily creeping back up and currently stand at a daily average of nearly nine. Signs of forced disappearances , persistently high extortion , and increased drug-related gang arrests have further served as fuel for critics of the initiative. Despite rising violence, and the fact that the process has been largely abandoned by the administration responsible for it, the gang leaders continue pushing forward. Some analysts have suggested there is a generational split emerging: older members seem to be seeking a respectful exit, and younger members want to continue what they call ""la vida loca,"" or ""the crazy life."" Regardless of the reason, both internal and external disputes indicate there is little cohesion regarding the process. The truce has also been criticized because it gave the MS13 and Barrio 18 newfound political capital and the power to gain concessions from the government by threatening a resurgence of violence. The initiative itself was built around these kinds of perks -- around 30 gang leaders were transferred to medium security prisons, and leaked recordings indicate financial incentives may also have been involved. The new government has not said what its policy will be with regards to the truce, but the gangs supported the FMLN at the polls, and there are some ex-FMLN guerrillas who are gang leaders. In addition, the new government may have to integrate these other gangs into the process."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexicos Sinaloa Cartel Without El Chapo. The capture of Mexico's most wanted fugitive, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, raises the question if the Sinaloa Cartel's criminal operations will be significantly affected. In short, the answer is: probably not. Indeed, El Chapo's previous arrest in February 2014 brought about no demonstrable detrimental impact to the Sinaloa Cartel's activities. On the contrary, business proceeded largely as usual. And it does not appear circumstances have changed enough for his recapture to precipitate a major breakdown of the Sinaloa Cartel's operations. Nonetheless, to play devil's advocate, the conditions of El Chapo's detainment will be different this time around, potentially affecting the Sinaloa Cartel's operations more negatively than during El Chapo's previous stints in prison. For instance, the planning and coordination needed to execute El Chapo's famous July 2015 escape from the Altiplano maximum-security prison (where he is again being held following his January 8 arrest ) suggests he was not held under the utmost stringent security. Now, however, in order to avoid another embarrassment, Mexican officials will place El Chapo under intense supervision. This may impose greater difficulties on his passing of messages and orders to criminal associates outside prison, reducing his ability to manage and maintain his criminal enterprise. El Chapo's isolation from the Sinaloa Cartel's operations would be further increased if he is extradited to the United States. At the moment, this appears likely to happen. Soon after his arrest, Mexico's Attorney General's Office (Procuraduria General de la Republica - PGR) announced it had begun extradition proceedings against El Chapo, a marked shift in Mexico's previous opposition to such a move. Regardless if he is extradited or not (a process that may take a year), El Chapo being back behind bars may see Mexican authorities shift their efforts to capturing other Sinaloa Cartel leaders. El Chapo has consistently been the focus of government attention on the Sinaloa Cartel, thereby allowing other key leaders to operate from the shadows and manage the organization's criminal endeavors under less intense pressure. This is perhaps most true of Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, El Chapo's business partner and one of the most prolific drug traffickers in the world. With El Chapo's recapture, El Mayo will once again become the nominal head of the Sinaloa Cartel , pushing him back into the spotlight (El Mayo is the man believed to have taken the reins of the Sinaloa Cartel following El Chapo's 2014 arrest, and he is expected to assume full control once again). But if El Mayo becomes the new top target of Mexican officials, and he were to be captured, it would remove one of the most enduring figures of the Sinaloa Cartel, potentially crippling a significant portion of its operations. Additionally, it is conceivable, though unlikely, for a figure such as former Sinaloa boss Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno, alias ""El Azul"" -- who reportedly died in June 2014 of a heart attack - to re-emerge. Mexican criminals have been known to fake their death, as was the case with Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, alias ""El Chayo,"" of La Famila Michoacana, and El Azul's death was never confirmed. This has prompted conspiracy theories he is alive and well, and possibly even an invisible power within the Sinaloa Cartel capable of managing its activities in El Chapo's absence. However, neither the arrest of El Mayo nor the resurrection of El Azul occurred following El Chapo's 2014 capture; it would be a surprise if either happened now. Indeed, El Mayo has managed to avoid capture over the course of his 40-plus years in the drug business. This despite a $5 million bounty placed on his head by US officials. El Mayo's elusiveness is credited to his discretion and business savvy, preferring to pay bribes and corrupt officials before resorting to violence. There are no indications his capture is imminent, and his previous ability to hold the Sinaloa Cartel together without El Chapo suggests he will be able to do so again. Nor is it a given Mexican officials will keep the Sinaloa Cartel in its crosshairs and seek to further degrade its activities. El Chapo has been the cause of great international embarrassment and domestic scorn for the administration of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, elevating his recapture to a top priority. Yet following El Chapo's 2014 arrest, instead of seeking to further gains against the Sinaloa Cartel, Mexican officials refocused security efforts on the upstart Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG). This is consistent with the Mexican government's alleged preference for targeting more violent groups , like the Zetas, rather than their (relatively) less violent Sinaloa Cartel competitors. While leading to speculation over government corruption, such target selection by Mexican officials may in part be a result of the preference for Sinaloa Cartel leaders like El Azul for bribery over violence. This, in part, relates to the overall structure of Mexico's criminal landscape. For instance, the Sinaloa Cartel is primarily dedicated to large-scale transnational drug trafficking. This stands in contrast to groups like the Zetas and Guerreros Unidos, who engage in less sophisticated locally-focused crimes like extortion and kidnapping, drawing the ire of citizens and heightened demands for government action. Overall, however, the Sinaloa Cartel's demonstrated ability to withstand leadership turnover highlights the resiliency of its horizontal leadership structure. That is, the Sinaloa Cartel is better understood as a ""federation"" of various cooperating criminal groups and partners, rather than as a monolithic, top-down enterprise. This has enabled it to absorb personnel shocks -- such as El Chapo's previous arrests -- without the fragmentation or disintegration experienced by other Mexican criminal organizations that suffered a loss of leadership. As El Chapo correctly states in his controversial interview with celebrity Sean Penn, the business of drug trafficking will continue unabated even after he is gone. It seems certain that, despite his renewed absence, the Sinaloa Cartel will as well."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Brazil Oil Giant Petrobras Implicated in Money Laundering Scheme. Authorities in Brazil are investigating the possible existence of a criminal group inside state-owned oil company Petrobras that is involved in money laundering, the latest in a series of scandals to hit one of Latin America's biggest companies. Brazilian police believe Petrobras' purchase of an overpriced Texas oil refinery in 2012 could be related to a national investigation into money laundering dubbed ""Operation Car Wash."" Authorities say they have evidence to suggest the company's former director of refining and supply, Paulo Roberto Costa, acted as a go-between for money launderers and the state, reported A Tarde. Costa was arrested in March for his role in other money laundering operations, but his capture was not initially linked to the purchase of the refinery. Petrobras recently came under fire when Brazil's Congress decided to open an investigation into the purchase of the refinery, for which the company paid $1.2 billion -- many times what the Belgian oil company they were buying from had paid several years earlier. President Dilma Rousseff was the chairwoman of Petrobras when the deal began in 2006 and has been criticized for approving the purchase, although she claims she was acting based on erroneous information. Rousseff has not yet been implicated in any wrongdoing. Investigators now believe that funds earmarked for the refinery purchase may have diverted, and that the deal could be linked to a ""criminal organization"" operating within Petrobras, which is dedicated to siphoning off funds then laundering the money through offshore accounts. Petrobras is one of the highest valued companies in Latin America, although it has entered a period of steep economic decline. In 2008, the company was the sixth largest in the world, but it has since lost half of its market value and was reportedly $114.3 billion in debt by the end of 2013. The sheer size of the company, as well as the vast sums of money it handles, can create space for criminal opportunists. If the money laundering allegations are true, Petrobras would not be the first of the region's state-owned oil giants to become embroiled in a criminal scandal. Mexico's oil company Pemex recently came under increased scrutiny for its ties to ADT Petroservicios, an oil services firm that reportedly laundered money for the Zetas. In addition to the current refinery scandal, Petrobras has also been accused of accepting over $100 million in bribes from SBM Offshore NV, a Dutch company that leases oil production ships."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Undocumented Migration: Its Not the Economy, Stupid. A substantial drop in undocumented immigration from Mexico to the United States, but is this really due to Mexicans staying home to enjoy rising prosperity, or are there other factors at play? According to a 2010 Department of Homeland Security report , the number of undocumented immigrants living in the United States declined from 11.6 million in 2008 to 10.6 million in 2009, the largest decrease in 30 years. One of the most common explanations for this phenomenon is that Mexico has witnessed the emergence of a middle class, lessening the economic incentive to cross the border. While it is true that a segment of the population has seen a growth in disposable income over the past five years, a July study by consulting firm De la Riva Group revealed that only 32 percent of the country is ""middle class,"" defined as making the equivalent of between 13,500 pesos ($1,000) and 98,499 pesos ($7,360) per month. In contrast, the latest poverty statistics from Mexico's government poverty monitor CONEVAL indicate that the number of people living below the poverty line in Mexico (2,114 pesos or $158 per month in urban areas, 1,329 pesos or $99 per month in the countryside) increased by 3.2 million between 2008 and 2010, and now stands at 52 million. This figure amounts to more than 46 percent of the country's 112 million inhabitants. This directly contradicts optimistic accounts in the US media which imply that increasing standards of living in Mexico are causing immigration to fall, such as recently published articles in the Sacramento Bee and New York Times. While CONEVAL notes that a handful of states (notably Puebla, Coahuila and Morelos) have made some inroads against poverty, it cannot by any means be said that the country is mostly middle class. Another commonly cited explanation for the reduction in undocumented migration is the surge in deportations under the Obama administration, which presents a further deterrent to those thinking about crossing the border. According to figures recently released by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), a record 396,906 individuals were deported from October 2010 through September of this year. As a result of this trend, many individuals who continue to risk the perilous border crossing are seasoned experts who have crossed multiple times, often because they have families in the U.S. According to the New York Times , 56 percent of arrests at the Mexican border in 2010 involved people who had been caught previously, up from 44 percent in 2005. But while stiffer immigration laws such as the "" Secure Communities "" initiative are doubtlessly contributing to the reduction in undocumented immigration, several recent reports have suggested that the primary reason for the drop is the drug war in Mexico. According to the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies' director David Fitzgerald, the violence has become so great that potential migrants are no longer interested in risking their lives to make the trip. In a recent interview with Spanish news agency EFE , Fitzgerald claimed that surveys of migrant source communities in the states of Jalisco, Oaxaca and Yucatan reveal that the top concern among Mexican migrants is the level of violence along the border. Fitzgerald's remarks come just days after Salvador Beltran del Rio, the director of Mexico's National Institute of Migration (INM), told local press that there had been an estimated reduction of nearly 70 percent *in the number of Central American migrants passing through the country in the past five years. Beltran's estimate is based on the number of foreign migrants detained in Mexico, which has fallen from 433,000 in 2005 to 140,000 last year. According to the official, this drop in Central Americans using Mexico as their gateway to the US is due to the threat from Mexican drug trafficking organizations, who have become increasingly involved in migrant smuggling. Out of every 10 migrants who attempt to go northward, according to Belran, six employ a ""coyote,"" who they pay to transport them across the U.S. border. As InSight Crime has reported , these middlemen are increasingly in the service of the cartels, and frequently extort or kidnap the migrants, killing those who refuse to cooperate. Such was the fate of 72 Central American migrants in August 2010, who were found buried in a mass grave in the northern state of Tamaulipas. Sometimes the migrants are coerced into working for the cartels in order to pay for their passage, as evidenced by the recent discovery of 61 migrants who had been held in forced labor by the Zetas in Piedras Negras, Coahuila. With incidents such as these reported regularly along the border, it is no wonder that the incentive to travel al norte has reduced. "	0	0	1	1	0	0	1
"Honduras: The Country that Kills its Prisoners - Part I. It seems the most violent country in the world also has the most violent prisons in the world. Or at least the prisons in which some of the worst massacres in modern Latin American history have taken place. In the most recent, in 2012, more than 300 people were burned to death; in the penultimate, more than 100; in the one prior to that, more than 60 And while these outbursts have shaken Honduras, the reality is that assassinations, sponsored or permitted by the state, occur every other day. Everyone knows what happened in the prison of El Porvenir and everyone, especially Honduras, seems to have forgotten: at 9:10 am on April 5, 2003, 10 minutes after the mutiny broke out, police and soldiers entered the courtyard with their heavy weapons and pistols, theoretically to restore order. At that point, only five people had died. Two hours later, 68 corpses had piled up in 20 cells. *** Barrio 18 gang members began the battle. A non-aggression pact had been observed for months beforehand between them and the ""Paisas"" -- the prisoners unaffiliated to any gang. Despite constantly appearing on newspaper front pages; despite being seen to embody evil and inspire fear; and despite their capacity for violence, history shows that in Honduras, when it comes to doing battle with other criminal groups or security forces, gang members generally come off worse. The peace of El Porvenir, in the coastal city of La Ceiba, rested on that certainty. The paisas outnumbered gang members fourfold, even counting the newcomers. And it was paisas who made up the ""rondines"" -- the group of prisoners to whom prison authorities had for years delegated the responsibility of maintaining order in the courtyard; men who, with a blow from a club or machete, imposed law within the prison walls. This is the first part of a two part story, read part two here. This article originally appeared in El Faro and was translated and reprinted with permission. See Spanish original here. With the explosion of plan ""Zero Tolerance"" against gangs, put in place by the government of President Ricardo Maduro (2002 - 2006), while in the streets police had begun to pursue and rout the feared and despised gangs to the applause of the population, in the prisons they were watched and treated like dangerous animals. In El Porvenir, the authorities had given the rondines the keys to cells 2 and 6, occupied by members of the Barrio 18 gang. The paisas, led by Edgardo Coca, decided who came and went, and when. They made continuous checks, up to three per day. They also established collective punishment for gang members. This unequal peace, however, began to crack on March 7 that year, when Mario Cerrato, alias ""Boris,"" landed in El Porvenir with 29 other Barrio 18 members. They had been transferred from Tamara prison, ostensibly to avoid quarrels with other prisoners. Theoretically to avoid deaths. Once in El Porvenir, Boris quickly and indignantly noted that the Barrio 18 kept its head down in the face of abuses carried out by non-gang prisoners. Almost immediately he conjured unwritten rules for the gang and managed to displace then-leader Edwin Calona, alias ""The Danger,"" in decision making. Boris had war in mind. It is known that he bribed a guard to provide him with a gun and over the course of four weeks organized a plan of attack. On Saturday, April 5, he took his new gun and went to the cell in which Coca and the other leaders of the rondines were gathered. Alongside him were The Danger and eight other gang members armed with sticks and knives. Boris' first shot killed Jose Alberto Almendarez, the deputy-head of the patrols. Amid the initial confusion, the gang members managed to gun down or hack to death four paisas. Many of the patrol members fled and sought refuge in the bathrooms of their cells. Others, the veterans, ran for their weapons, to respond to Boris. All witnesses agree that when, 10 minutes after the first shot, the police guarding the prison and army reinforcements entered the courtyard, they did so with guns blazing and a clear intention to protect the paisas, killing all gang members who crossed their path. Immediately, patrol members, guards and soldiers formed a single battalion and pushed most of the gang members back into their cells. The carnage was about to begin. A patrol member padlocked cell 6, in which 25 people had taken refuge -- including a woman and a girl who had entered as a visitor shortly before the shooting -- placed cardboard and mattresses against the barred door, doused them with fuel and set them on fire. The policemen watching did not lift a finger. A few meters away, in front of cell number 2, policemen, soldiers and patrol members fired their weapons at gang members who had taken refuge there, while shouting at them to surrender. For a moment the crossfire ceased: gang members surrendered and tossed their guns into the courtyard. But the first who dared to come out with their hands up were shot. One died on the spot. Those who remained on the ground, wounded, writhing, were beaten and stabbed by the patrol members. Those who had remained barricaded in the cell suffered an even more brutal death: the smoke and flames from cell 6 passed through to cell 2 and forced them out. Lying face down on the floor, they were executed. After beating them and stabbing them, they were all shot. The same shots later allowed Arabeska Sanchez to reconstruct what happened. In every corner of the prison, supported by the police and military arms, the paisas completed their revenge. Policemen finished off wounded gang members, while soldiers watched in silence as patrols destroyed already disfigured corpses. The commander in charge of the operation, Deputy Commissioner Carlos Esteban Henriquez, stopped the slaughter at around 11 am, when he learned that from the ladder of a fire truck that had just arrived to extinguish the blaze, a cameraman was recording everything. Only then did he order his men to stop firing and move the wounded to a hospital. In his first statement to reporters, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry, Deputy Commissioner Leonel Sauceda, said that among the incidents caused by the gang members in recent months, this had been ""the most serious."" Of the 68 victims -- 60 of whom were Barrio 18 members -- 23 displayed gunshot wounds. Five bled to death. One had received 20 machete blows to the head. In cell number 6, 25 people died from asphyxiation or burning. The body of one of them was burned to the point that it was impossible to identify -- not even its age or sex could be ascertained. The bodies of the dead were taken to San Pedro Sula for autopsy. They arrived at the morgue rotting, unable to endure the four hour ride in the back of unrefrigerated trucks. President Ricardo Maduro, his Security Minister Oscar Alvarez and his deputy Armando Calidonio, reached the prison at 4 pm, while bodies still lay on the floor. Within minutes, a member of the presidential entourage ordered firefighters to immediately clear the scene of slaughter so that surviving prisoners, who had been evacuated at the height of the fire, could return to their cells as soon as possible. It didn't matter that -- and even today there are those who suggest this was the purpose of restoring order -- the water would erase potential evidence and turn the crime scene into a blank slate. * This article originally appeared in El Faro and was translated and reprinted with permission.

Guatemala New AG Appointment Blow to Anti-Impunity Campaigners. President Otto Perez has named Thelma Aldana as Guatemala's new attorney general, a controversial decision that raises fears of a return to impunity after four years of judicial reform. Perez announced his decision on May 9, dismissing accusations that Aldana has ties to his political party, the Patriotic Party, and that her appointment was politically motivated. The president claimed he made his decision based on Aldana's 25 years of judicial experience, reported Prensa Libre. Aldana currently serves as a Supreme Court justice and will replace Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz on May 17. She was one of six nominees out of 26 original candidates put forward by a selection committee for Perez to make the final decision. The selection process that resulted in Aldana's appointment has been widely criticized both nationally and internationally for its apparent lack of impartiality. From the beginning, Aldana was regarded as the preferred candidate of the government and was reportedly backed by both Gustavo Herrera, a prominent businessman with alleged criminal ties and huge influence over the process, and Vice President Roxana Baldetti, who herself has faced accusations of connections to criminal networks. The current Attorney General, Paz y Paz, was excluded from the shortlist of candidates despite the fact that she received the second highest ranking based on professional, academic and personal qualifications. Over the last four years, Paz y Paz has taken on corruption and organized crime and reduced Guatemala's high levels of impunity. She has received international recognition for her work, including a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2013, but her aggressive tactics have also made her an enemy of Guatemala's elite, which maintains close links to Guatemala's criminal networks and drug trafficking groups. Given her ties to the country's political elite, it is unlikely Aldana will take the same tough stance on corruption and organized crime. Plaza Publica reported that Aldana also has links to the Guatemalan Republican Front, which was founded by former dictator Efrain Rios Montt. These allegations are especially troubling because as Attorney General, Aldana will be in charge of prosecuting Rios Montt when he returns to trial in January 2015. If these accusations are true, Aldana's appointment could be a serious setback to advances made under Paz y Paz.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Authorities Recover Homes, Schools, Churches From Gangs. Honduran authorities have recovered 90 houses and several schools and churches that had been abandoned and taken over by gangs in San Pedro Sula, representing a success for ongoing security operations, but failing to address underlying problems. Members of the national police and armed forces reclaimed the buildings in the Chamelecon sector, one of the city's most violent zones, as part of Operation Liberty , an ongoing operation in which the military and police conduct joint daily street patrols, reported El Heraldo. Defense Minister Marlon Pascua said that residents were forced to flee as a result of gang activity by the Barrio 18 and MS-13 ""maras"" and other street gangs. Some of the recovered homes still contained kitchen items, clothing and family photographs r eported La Prensa. The military will continue to maintain a 24-hour presence in the area in order to guarantee a safe return for displaced residents. The gang-related displacement in San Pedro Sula also occurs in neighborhoods in Honduras' capital Tegucigalpa, where residents flee their homes to avoid repercussions because they cannot afford the exorbitant extortion payments demanded by gangs. In some cases, gangs later take over the homes and use them as drug storage and sales points. A similar phenomenon of internal displacement has occurred in cities in El Salvador -- where the maras also have a strong presence -- as families struggle to avoid gang violence. According to the military, since the start of Operation Liberty four months ago, homicides have dropped significantly in San Pedro Sula -- considered the most dangerous city in the world -- and the ongoing campaign has apparently had some success in creating a semblance of normalcy in the city. However, military patrols cannot be viewed as a long term solution and at some point civilian security forces must take over. With reports that police themselves are involved in the extortion rackets that have caused displacement, and an overall culture of ingrained police corruption and involvement with organized crime , this is not a promising prospect."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Public Support for Arrested Rebel Vigilante Leader Building in Mexico. The prosecution of rebel vigilante leader Jose Manuel Mireles in Mexico has sparked a public backlash, and with a new poll suggesting 70 percent of Mexicans support the vigilante movement, the government may soon find itself losing the public relations war and facing a new threat. On June 5, a court handed Mireles a formal detention order, initiating the legal process against him, reported Excelsior. Mireles, who was arrested on June 27 shortly after leading a vigilante militia takeover of a town in the southwestern state of Michoacan, will now be charged of possessing illegal weapons and drugs. However, a campaign to free Mireles is building. In Michoacan, self-defense militias and their supporters have staged roadblocks and solidarity marches , while prominent figures and organizations ranging from Mexican politicians to the hacker collective Anonymous have publicly backed him. Mireles' lawyer has even launched a campaign encouraging people to shave their head in solidarity after images emerged of a newly shaven Mireles in prison. A new survey released by polling firm Parametria suggests the campaign is likely to resonate among Mexicans. According to the poll 70 percent of Mexican's have a ""good"" or ""very good"" perception of the self-defense movement, reported Vanguardia. Of those that knew of Mireles, 67 percent had a positive perception of him, although the poll was taken before Mireles' arrest. The arrest of Mireles has become a focal point for the rift created by the Mexican government's decision to legalize factions of the self-defense movement, which arose in 2013 to combat the Knights Templar criminal organization in Michoacan. As evidenced by the Parametria poll, the vigilantes' success in driving out the Knights Templar has earned the movement considerable public backing, and stands in stark contrast to the state's failure to break the Knight's stranglehold on Michoacan. While some vigilante leaders have now institutionalized, joining the new ""Rural Defense Forces,"" others such as Mireles have remained on the outside, operating in a legal limbo. If the rebel groups continue to take the initiative while the legalized forces remain comparatively inactive, then this public support may well be transferred to the illegal militias. If the state gives Mireles and other illegal militias room to operate then it undermines the whole legalization process. However, if the authorities continue to persecute figures such as Mireles, they risk turning them into martyrs while highlighting their own failings. Perhaps even more of a concern, they also risk pushing the militias further down the road to illegality and criminality by labeling them as outlaw groups."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Is Venezuela Becoming the Most Dangerous Nation in Latin America?With nearly 25,000 violent deaths estimated for 2014 and 90 violent deaths reported in Caracas in the first week of 2015, Venezuela is now one of the most dangerous nations in the Americas, although the lack of official statistics obscure the true scale of the security crisis. As El Nacional reported , the Caracas Bello Monte morgue received 90 bodies during the first six days of the new year. The violence hasn't been limited to the Venezuelan capital: in the northern state of Aragua, a gang reportedly ambushed a funeral and killed seven people, wounding another five. The killings do not bode well for Venezuela, where the government has not released official statistics on violent deaths since 2005. The Venezuelan Violence Observatory, an NGO made up of researchers from seven universities across the country, estimated that there were 24,980 violent deaths in Venezuela last year -- including homicides, police killings, and deaths with unknown intent. OVV researcher Alberto Camardiel told InSight Crime via e-mail that specifically, the OVV estimates the following for 2014: There were 16,549 homicides in Venezuela -- a homicide rate of 54 for every 100,000 people. There were 3,485 police killings -- a rate of about 11 for every 100,000 people. There were 4,947 deaths of undetermined intent -- a rate of about 16 for every 100,000. These numbers aren't body counts based on current police data, death certificates, or data from other official sources, as the Venezuelan government doesn't make this information available to the public. Instead, they are the OVV's projections based on statistical models that rely on past available data, compiled by investigative police agency the CICPC. The government hasn't yet released their count of the 2014 homicide rate -- nor have they released an estimate on the total number of violent deaths there were in Venezuela. However, Venezuela's former interior minister did say last year that homicides are going down -- he predicted that 2014 would close with a homicide rate of between 32 to 35 murders for every 100,000 people. He supplied no data to support this claim. While this is significantly lower than the OVV's 2014 estimate of 54 per 100,000, another data set suggests that the OVV's projections are quite reasonable when it comes to measuring violence in the country, as indicated in the chart below. (The numbers for the ""official"" homicide and violent death rate are taken from a 2012 presentation by Woodrow Wilson Center expert Ana Maria Sanjuan. According to her presentation, the data was compiled by the Central University of Venezuela , and is based on ""official statistics."" The violent death rate presented here does include homicides, police killings, and killings of undetermined intent. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime [UNODC] statistics from here. The OVV statistics measure Venezuela's homicide rate from 2000 to 2008). At the end of the day, the OVV's numbers are well-informed estimates, carefully put together in the belief that these projections are better than nothing. Venezuela badly needs more transparency and hard data about the country's ongoing violence, although the government has resisted requests to provide it , insisting the information would be distorted and manipulated by the political opposition. Even the Ministry of Health hasn't updated its death records since 2011. Further muddying the waters are obscure statements about the violence by government officials, usually raising more questions than answers. What did the former interior minister mean, for example, when he said last year that 76 percent of Venezuela's homicides involved conflicts between rival gangs, and conflicts between criminals and security forces? How do officials distinguish between these two categories? Is it something similar to Mexico, in which the government deems a death is a ""murder linked to organized crime"" depending on the caliber of the firearm found at the crime scene? With an estimated homicide rate of 54 deaths for every 100,000 people, this puts Venezuela among the top three most violent countries in Latin America, right behind El Salvador -- with a 2014 homicide rate of 69 per 100,000 -- and Honduras, with a rate of 66. When considering Venezuela's violent death rate, the country is the second most violent in the world, right behind Honduras, according to the OVV. If Venezuela is able to at last push through with the mass implementation of a trained, community police force that doesn't rely so heavily on excessive force -- perhaps resulting in fewer people killed in confrontations with police -- this could reduce violence somewhat in 2015. Another short-term solution that the Venezuela could realistically take in the short term would be to finally release its data on violence, along with a detailed explanation of their methodology for compiling the numbers. While this wouldn't impact violence rates, it would mean that the political opposition could no longer accuse the government of lack of transparency -- and if homicide rates are indeed going down, it would arguably be in the government's interest to finally do so. However, InSight Crime believes that homicides are going to increase during 2015, as Venezuela faces a shortfall in revenue due to falling oil prices and increasing social unrest."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Homicide Rates Fell in Guatemalan Regions After State of Emergency. Crime data released by police in Guatemala for 2011 indicates that the homicide rates in two provinces with significant drug cartel presence have fallen significantly following security crackdowns there. According to Plaza Publica's analysis of data released by the National Civil Police (PNC), the departments of Alta Verapaz and Peten, where the government declared ""states of siege"" to root out drug traffickers in 2010 and 2011 respectively, both saw a decrease in homicide rates of more than 20 percent in 2011. The data suggests that murder rates fell in 2011 in all but eight of the country's 22 departments. This fits with recent announcements by government officials, who claim that the national homicide rate fell to 38.61 per 100,000 in 2011 , down from 41.5 in 2010. Guatemala Department, which contains the capital city, is no longer the most dangerous province in the country. In 2011 it was replaced by the eastern department of Zacapa, which, along with Esquintla and Santa Rosa departments in the south, are both the most dangerous departments and those which saw the biggest increases in homicide rates last year. The drop in homicides in Alta Verapaz and Peten is an encouraging sign for Guatemala. As InSight Crime has reported , police and military operations did not result in any significant arrests, and there has been no indication that drug trafficking activity fell significantly in either department. However, the states of siege could have had at least a deterrent effect, convincing traffickers to be more discreet about their activities, and avoid the kind of police and media attention that the Zetas' massacre of 27 farmhands brought in May 2011. Despite the apparent drop in violence, Guatemala remains a violent country and is still a key transit nation for cocaine destined for the US market. Recently, there have also been indications that the country is becoming a drug producing nation as well, potentially even rivaling Mexico in meth production. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Paraguay Uncovers Multinational Group Linked to Domestic Cocaine Processing. Authorities in Paraguay have reported the presence of a multinational drug trafficking organization that processes cocaine domestically and flies it to the Brazil border, in a case underlining the country's growing role in the regional drug trade. The group -- made up of Colombians, Bolivians and Paraguayans and allegedly based in the city of Pedro Juan Caballero, near the Brazilian border -- is believed to source cocaine from Colombia and transport it first to Bolivia. They then fly the product from the southern Bolivian state of Santa Cruz into the northern Paraguayan region of Chaco, and finally on to the border states of Amambay and Canindeyu, from where the drugs are transported overland to Brazil and exported to Europe, reported ABC Color. The operation was uncovered following the recent recovery of 292 kilos of cocaine in the Boqueron province , part of the Chaco region. According to authorities, the group is also responsible for a cocaine processing laboratory found in February in Palmar de las Islas, near the border with Bolivia. The site was allegedly used to process cocaine paste from Bolivia in order to save time and money by cutting out the Colombian leg of the journey, reported ABC. Following the recent seizure, the head of Paraguay's anti-drug agency SENAD, Luis Rojas, declared the country is no longer just a cocaine transit nation, but is also now a processing venue. The latest discovery reinforces the notion that Paraguay is gaining importance in the transnational drug trade, something also evidenced by its conversion into a drug processing center and an increasingly heavy presence of Brazilian organized crime groups. The cocaine lab near the Bolivian border was the third to be found in Paraguay in little over a year, after two were discovered near the Brazilian border in early 2013. With Brazilian criminal groups firmly established throughout the border area , it is very possible this multinational group was collaborating with Brazilians once the drugs reached the frontier. A variety of factors could explain the shifting of processing to Paraguay, among them rampant corruption and the country's status as a hub for illicit products, which likely facilitates the flow of precursor chemicals. Ciudad del Este, in the country's infamous Triple Frontier region with Brazil and Argentina, is a key spot for contraband, while the southwestern border is located near routes between Argentina and Bolivia used to traffic both drugs and precursor chemicals.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Nabs Argentina-Based Money Launderer. Authorities in Colombia have captured a man they said was the main Argentina-based connection for Colombian organized crime, who is accused of laundering huge amounts of money on behalf of several major crime bosses. On January 15, Colombian prosecutors and international police agency Interpol coordinated the arrest of Alejandro Gracia Alvarez, alias ""Gato Seco,"" in capital city Bogota, according to a press release from the Attorney General's Office. Gato Seco allegedly formed part of a criminal organization dedicated to drug trafficking and money laundering in the Southern Cone region. Gato Seco got his start in 2003 when his brother-in-law, Juan Carlos Ramirez Abadia, alias ""Chupeta,"" a leader of the now-defunct Norte del Valle Cartel, sent him to Argentina to found several front companies and buy up properties, according to a US agent interviewed by El Tiempo. Over the years, Gato Seco allegedly handled the Argentinean financial operations of at least a dozen major Colombian crime bosses, including Ignacio Alvarez Meyendorff, Daniel ""El Loco"" Barrera, Henry de Jesus Lopez, alias ""Mi Sangre,"" and Luis Caicedo, alias ""Don Lucho"" (pictured below, left to right). Using contacts in Colombia's migration agency and a network of front companies, Gato Seco allegedly facilitated the entry of Colombian drug traffickers into Argentina, provided the crime bosses with fake identity documents, and laundered their money, reported El Tiempo. Gato Seco laundered over $900 million in drug trafficking proceeds just for Alvarez Meyendorff alone, according to the Attorney General's Office. Gato Seco is wanted in Argentina on various charges, including drug trafficking and possession, money laundering, and carrying weapons. Gato Seco has allegedly worked with a large number of Colombia's major crime bosses, crossing criminal lines to conduct financial operations for leaders from rival groups. His capture could put several different criminal organizations at risk, should Gato Seco decide to collaborate with authorities and share information about hidden criminal assets. Argentina has long been a favorite hideout for Colombian criminals and a hub for laundering their dirty cash. Argentina's role as a drug transit nation and its lucrative domestic cocaine market make the country an attractive base of operations for foreign drug traffickers, who can use the proceeds from local drug sales to fund transnational shipments. Several of Gato Seco's high-level contacts fled to Argentina before they were captured. Alvarez Meyendorff, an alleged former Norte del Valle Cartel member and the financial operator of a criminal network that included El Loco Barrera and Don Lucho, was captured in Buenos Aires in 2011 , a year after Don Lucho was arrested in the same city. Mi Sangre, who was once a major figure in both Medellin's Oficina de Envigado and the Urabenos, was detained in Argentina in 2012. El Loco Barrera's ex-wife was captured in Argentina the same year."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"As Violence Rises, El Salvador Police Contradict Themselves. Amidst rising violence in El Salvador, a new problem has emerged: contradictory narratives from the police. According to ElSalvador.com , sources within El Salvador's police intelligence said that leaders of the country's largest gangs, the MS13 and Barrio 18, have been scheming for weeks to launch a combined assault against the government, with gang members waiting for the ""green light"" to proceed as planned. Intelligence reports -- said to be based on intercepted communications between gang leaders -- revealed, as the news source put it, ""The gangs are hoping to take more aggressive actions and are planning an alliance between themselves."" Such a coordinated offensive would consist of increasing homicides and attacking ""public employees, state infrastructure, and parts of the private sector,"" and would be meant to demonstrate to the government the gangs' strength. The stated impetus for such collaboration are the recent transfers of gang leaders to the maximum-security prison in Zacatecoluca, as well as the recent deaths of gang members during confrontations with police and soldiers. The transfers put an official end to a multi-year effort to forge a truce between the MS13 and the Barrio 18. Nonetheless, ElSalvador.com also reported not all elements of the two gangs agree with forming a common front. What's more, a top level police official, contacted by InSight Crime, denied the supposed intelligence of the report, stating simply that there was no possible alliance between the two gangs, which have fought each other for decades (for reasons the gang members no longer even remember ). The report about a gang alliance needs to be taken in the context of what is essentially an ongoing crisis in the government about how to deal with the gang issue following the dissolution of the truce. There are no easy answers, and hawkish positions seem to be winning the day on all sides, especially since the violence seems to be getting worse. In recent days , armed attacks by suspected gang members against military targets have left three dead and another three injured, bringing the total number of soldiers killed in 2015 to six. This past weekend, a total of 34 people were murdered in El Salvador. To combat this rise in violence , on April 18 President Salvador Sanchez Ceren announced the creation of three battalions -- consisting of a total of 1,200 members of the armed forces -- to fight crime in El Salvador's most dangerous municipalities. On April 20, Hato Hasbun -- assigned by Ceren to oversee a special public security council -- announced the formation of a special ""Cleansing Battalion,"" to be made up of 200 members of the National Police (PNC). Hasbun said this unit will be distinct from the three armed forces battalions, but the two will ""be working in a coordinated fashion."" No further details have been given, however, regarding the unit or its envisioned function. The government has also said it will mix the prison population. Since the early 2000s, gang members have been sent to prisons where their cohorts were housed. But now the government will move some top- and mid-level leaders of Barrio 18 to a prison where members of the MS13 are jailed; it will also send top- and mid-level MS13 leaders to what was a Barrio 18-controlled jail. While the ElSalvador.com report rightly suggests the gangs' leadership in the jails continues to communicate even though the truce between them has disintegrated , it is difficult to imagine the gangs possessing the ability to put aside their differences and personal interests in order to coordinate a unified armed offensive. Even if those in jail can agree they share a common enemy in state security forces , the gang members in the street have their own dynamic and share a deep distrust of their long-time gang adversaries. On the other side of the equation, the government appears to be taking an even more radical position with each passing day of violence. Top government officials have stated that police should use their weapons against criminals "" with complete confidence ,"" and that if more gang members were shot in ""legitimate self-defense,"" it could help pacify El Salvador ."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Considers Classifying Gangs as Terrorist Organizations. Lawmakers in Honduras are considering copying a recent decision by authorities in El Salvador to label gangs as terrorist groups, raising questions about what such a move would actually accomplish in the ongoing fight against gang violence in this Central American nation. Thomas Zambrano, president of the Congressional Commission for Security in Honduras, said that lawmakers will be able to propose changes to the national penal code that would classify gangs as terrorist organizations, reported El Heraldo. Zambrano's comments come just days after El Salvador's Supreme Court ruled that the MS13 and Barrio 18 gangs operating in that country constitute terrorist groups. Zambrano was quick to note that any proposed changes to the penal code might not survive the revision process that will take place before there is a final vote on the legislation. In July of this year, Honduras' Congress passed legislation known as the ""anti-gang law"" that increased penalties for gang members and leaders. The legislation calls for prison terms of between 20 and 30 years for convicted gang members and up to 40 years for gang leaders. Under a terrorism designation, any gang member, regardless of leadership status, could face a prison sentence of up to 40 years. It is unclear what a move to reclassify Honduran gangs as terrorist organizations would achieve. Both Honduras and El Salvador have had strict anti-gang laws on the books for years, yet neither country has managed to significantly diminish the proliferation of gang activity. Implementing tougher legislation is an ineffective way to tackle gang violence as long as the institutions implementing these laws remain corrupt and inefficient. The proposal to update Honduras' legal code would reportedly define terrorism as any premeditated violent act committed by a criminal organization that is meant to intimidate society at large, the government, or an international organization. Political motivation would not be a prerequisite for a terrorism designation. Nonetheless, the justification for labeling the Barrio 18 and MS13 as terrorist organizations is highly questionable , and may in fact backfire by conferring some degree of political status on these criminal groups. The US Department of State's list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations only includes illegal armed groups in Latin America that were formed within a political context, such as Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in Colombia and the Shining Path in Peru. In contrast, the political motivations behind the gangs' criminal activities remain in doubt ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Computer Shows FARC Links to Sinaloa Cartel. Colombian authorities have released information on a computer seized from the commander of the FARC's Southern Bloc, Jose Benito Cabrera, alias ""Fabian Ramirez,"" allegedly showing rebel links with the Sinaloa Cartel. The government claimed to have killed Cabrera during ""Operation Nemesis,"" an aerial bombardment of a FARC camp in the southern province of Caqueta on November 20. However, the rebel leader's body has not been recovered , although his computer was unearthed. Among the computer files decrypted were documents stating that a Mario Sanchez Zavaleta was the liasion for the Marxist rebels with the Sinaloa cartel. Cocaine shipments were allegedly sent directly to the Mexican cartel or via Panama and Costa Rica. El Tiempo also published photos (one of which is above) allegedly taken from the seized laptops, showing Cabrera drinking and celebrating with other rebel troops supposedly after selling a ""big shipment"" of cocaine. The photos also show Sanchez Zavaleta, the alleged link between the Southern Bloc and the Sinaloa cartel. Intelligence from the laptops also reportedly name Wilson Burbano Ordonez, a confidant of Cabrera's, as another key business link with the Mexican cartels. He was arrested in 2009. The FARC has been linked to the Tijuana and Juarez Cartels. This is the first Colombian authorities have spoken of the rebels' connection to the Sinaloa Cartel. Mexican drug trafficking organizations have sought out the FARC in order to purchase coca paste, the raw material for cocaine, at the source, thereby controlling almost the entire chain of distribution and a greater sum of its profits.

"El Chapo Nephew Building Links to Colombian Gangs. A relative of Mexican drug lord Joaquin "" El Chapo "" Guzman has reportedly visited Colombia, seeking new business opportunities with the leaders of the Urabenos and Rastrojos criminal organizations. According to intelligence sources cited by Colombian newspaper El Tiempo , either a nephew or cousin of ""El Chapo,"" the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel , has been networking with other criminal groups in Colombia. The suspect allegedly held meetings with Rastrojos leaders in northern Bogota to discuss building a business together in the synthetic drug trade. According to the newspaper, Guzman's relative and his allies have also been meeting with Rastrojos and Urabenos leaders across the country, trying to build up a presence in key cocaine shipment points. These include the cities of Cali and Medellin, and their respective points of access to the sea: the Pacific port of Buenaventura, and the Caribbean region of Uraba. If El Tiempo's reports are correct, the Sinaloa Cartel is aiming to build up their connections with Colombia's two most powerful criminal groups, even though the two are rivals. This decision may have been influenced by the implosion of the Rastrojos in 2012. The gang's leader Javier Calle Serna, alias "" Comba ,"" handed himself in to the United States in May , and rival Diego Perez Henao, alias "" Diego Rastrojo ,"" was captured in Venezuela the following month. In October, Comba's brother Luis Enrique also surrendered to the United States. The Rastrojos have traditionally dominated the Pacific coast while rival group the Urabenos controlled much of the Caribbean. Now, with its major leaders gone, the Rastrojos' power is shaky. This is bad news for the Sinaloa Cartel, believed to deal mostly with the Rastrojos , as the decline of the Rastrojos could have left the Mexican cartel short of Colombian cocaine. The Urabenos, meanwhile, are believed to work primarily with Mexican group the Zetas. El Tiempo reports that a man known as ""Pollo Bobo"" (Stupid Chicken) is poised to become the Rastrojos' new commander, and is the main contact of Guzman's relative. Pollo Bobo was named in June as a rising Rastrojos leader, as InSight Crime reported ."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Is Anti-Graft Body CICIG Behind Guatemala Homicides Drop?A recent report argues that the anti-graft body CICIG directly contributed to a drop in killings in Guatemala. But this analysis might be overly simplistic and may still fail to persuade the US government to provide essential funding and support. The report , published by the International Crisis Group on October 24, claims that the United Nations-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG) prevented more than 4,500 homicides between its implementation in 2007 and 2017. To reach this conclusion, the report's authors imagined there were two Guatemalas: one with the CICIG and one without. The latter was a hypothetical country created using economic and social data from selected Latin American countries with ""strong similarities to pre-2007 Guatemala."" Murder rates in Guatemala have dropped by five percent on average annually since 2007, the year in which the CICIG was implemented to shoulder the Attorney General's Office in dismantling the powerful Illegal Clandestine Security Apparatuses (Cuerpos Ilegales y Aparatos Clandestinos de Seguridad - CIACS) criminal networks. In what the report calls the ""synthetic control,"" deaths rose by one percent annually over the same period. The study also argues that the international commission bolstered Guatemala's investigative and prosecution capacities. Improvements in which the CICIG was ""instrumental"" ranged from the creation of a witness protection program, to the development of bullet ballistics and DNA forensics capacities. Guatemala's homicide conviction rate has jumped from seven to 28 percent between 2006 and 2013. The CICIG has recently come under intense pressure from the administration of Guatemala President Jimmy Morales. In August 2018, Morales announced he would not renew the institution's mandate. This decision came after heavy backlash from elites targeted by the commission's probes into alleged illicit campaign financing, including those involved in Morales' successful 2015 presidential run. Despite its sophisticated methodology and innovative approach, the International Crisis Group's analysis of the CICIG's impact on homicides in Guatemala does not consider some key contributors to violence, including gangs, and is unlikely to persuade the White House to renew support for the anti-graft body. While the CICIG has helped create better methods of investigation and inter-institutional collaboration, a nalyzing a reduction in homicides is always an extremely complex process. In the case of Guatemala, earlier reports have described diverse factors ranging from better local governance to improved emergency services, which increases victims' survival rates without influencing levels of violence. Past studies have also highlighted the Morales administration's policy of deploying security resources to the country's 30 most violent municipalities. Such "" hot spot "" policing strategies that focus on areas that concentrate the most criminal activity have been shown to impact crime rates, including homicide levels. Most of the CICIG's work centers on investigating and prosecuting elite-level corruption and impunity. The commission does not focus on one of the main drivers of violence in Guatemala: street gangs. InSight Crime found in a 2017 investigation that 41 percent of homicides in one gang-controlled area could be ""reasonably attributed"" to gang-related activities. Guatemala's murder decrease could partly be the result of shifting gang dynamics. Increased criminal sophistication of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13), for instance, was raised to explain some of the drop in homicides in neighboring El Salvador. That is not to say that the commission doesn't have a role in cutting crime levels in Guatemala. Higher conviction rates have been found to correlate to lower crime levels, and the commission has been at the center of a broad societal push against impunity. This was evident once more this year when widespread protests broke out in support of the commission, and against backlash from targeted elites. Still, the deep, structural efforts to which the CICIG is dedicated are tough to quantify and translate into murder statistics. This certainly complicates securing US political support for the CICIG, which has wavered since President Donald Trump took office in 2017. Trump's presidency has also brought an exodus of experienced diplomats and security experts, many of whom supported the UN-backed commission. This favors erratic decision-making at highest levels of US foreign policy, leaving the CICIG vulnerable to political attacks that endanger the essential US funding for it."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"How Colombia Peace Crisis Could Shake Up Criminal Landscape. Colombia's surprise rejection of a peace agreement between the government and the hemisphere's longest-running insurgency could push rebel factions to abandon the tenuous peace process and return to criminal activities. Most observers expected the October 2 plebiscite to be an easy last hurdle for a long-negotiated peace accord between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). But a number of factors -- including low turnout, bad weather and the deep scars left by more than a half century of conflict -- led to a razor-thin victory for the ""No"" campaign. This has put the four-year-old peace process in limbo, increasing the chances that FARC members will peel away from the planned disarmament and demobilization with each passing day. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC commander Rodrigo Londono Echeverry, alias ""Timochenko,"" were quick to reassure the country that a bilateral ceasefire announced in August will remain in place. On October 4 -- a day after Timochenko stated that ""guerrilla fronts across the country will remain in a bilateral and definitive ceasefire"" -- Santos confirmed that the armistice would be extended until October 31. Although Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas has said that the ceasefire will be extended as many times as necessary, the president's declaration was seen by some as putting a time limit on crucial discussions between his administration and the leaders of the ""No"" campaign. President Santos formed a delegation on October 3 to engage in a dialogue with the opponents of the peace deal, headed mainly by the Democratic Center (Centro Democratico) party. The purpose of the talks is to seek to ameliorate the concerns of those who voted against the peace agreement, and to consider their recommendations for how to achieve an accord that is acceptable to a broader swath of the Colombian public. Former President Alvaro Uribe and other leading figures of the ""No"" campaign have so far made a few key demands : That FARC rebels immediately stop all crimes, and that they receive adequate protection. That rebels not involved in serious crimes be granted amnesty. That members of the armed forces accused of crimes be offered ""judicial relief"" in a separate jurisdiction from the FARC. That FARC members accused of crimes against humanity be barred from future political participation. Government negotiators are currently talking to FARC representatives to gauge the possibility of opening up certain points of the accord for renegotiation based on the demands of the ""No"" campaign. However, setting a time limit on the ceasefire while these talks continue could be a double edged sword. On one hand, it could pressure the ""No"" supporters to put forth modifications or alternatives to the deal more quickly. On the other hand, the possibility that the ceasefire may not be renewed could increase skepticism and hostility toward the process within the ranks of the FARC, who are already in a vulnerable position without the legal protection offered by the rejected accord. Timochenko appeared to voice concern about this possibility in a recent Twitter message : ""'JuanManSantos announces that the ceasefire with the FARC_EPueblo continues until October 31.' After that will the war continue?"" "" JuanManSantos anuncia que el cese al Fuego con las FARC_EPueblo va hasta el 31 de octubre"" ?De ahi para adelante continua la guerra? -- Timoleon Jimenez (Timochenko_FARC) October 5, 2016 FARC Secretariat member and peace negotiator Felix Antonio Munoz, alias ""Pastor Alape,"" also responded on Twitter by ordering all FARC units to move to ""secure positions,"" although he did not give further details about what this means. He added that the move would avoid ""provocations"" by those opposing the peace deal. Todas nuestras unidades deben empezar a moverse a posiciones seguras para evitar provocaciones https://t.co/QHVyFQloeo -- Pastor Alape (AlapePastorFARC) October 5, 2016 On October 5, rebel units began moving from the site of their last conference in south Colombia back to their places of origin by road and plane, under the protection of the armed forces, local media reported. The international community has responded to the unpredictable scenario by reiterating support for a peaceful, negotiated solution to the conflict. The United States and the United Nations have expressed their continuing support for a peace agreement, while the European Union has kept the FARC suspended from its list of terrorist organizations. The way forward now hinges on how the talks between the various negotiating parties unfold. While the Clock Is Ticking The longer Colombia takes to salvag e the peace process with the FARC, the greater the odds that guerrilla members will return to, or continue, criminal activities. InSight Crime understands that Congressional President Mauricio Lizcano has estimated that forming a new commission to negotiate with Colombia's opposition will take at least a month. The FARC will need to fund themselves during this indefinite period, and will presumably do so as they always have done -- through extortion, drug trafficking and other criminal activities. This may already be happening; InSight Crime has found that many FARC units across the country have ignored Timochenko's mid-2016 order to stop extortion. The uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the various ongoing negotiations may push FARC factions to break away from the peace process altogether. Although the guerrilla group voted unanimously to approve the peace deal at the rebels' most recent conference , they have since lost -- at least for now -- the judicial and political guarantees that the agreement offered them. Even before voters rejected the peace accord, there were indications that elements of the FARC were beginning to split away from the organization to form new criminal groups. The outspoken dissidence of the FARC's First Front and the unit's subsequent expulsion from the organization was one of the clearest warning signs that the guerrilla group was not fully united behind the peace deal. The unpredictable future of the peace process could encourage FARC units to abandon the idea of an eventual demobilization and to instead choose to pursue the potential riches offered by the drug trade and other illegal activities. Territorial Control Another issue of concern is where FARC fighters will go next. Prior to the October 2 ""No"" vote, some FARC units had already begun moving to the concentration zones where they were set to disarm. But this process now appears to have come to a standstill. With some FARC units apparently returning to their traditional areas of influence, this could both accelerate a return to criminal activity and bring the guerrillas into confrontation with other armed actors that had already been moving into their territories. One example of this dynamic has been observed in the municipality of El Bagre in the department of Antioquia, a zone rich in gold deposits and coca crops that is heavily disputed between armed groups. According to a prosecutor from the Medellin branch of the Attorney General's Office consulted by InSight Crime, the FARC recently handed the area over to the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) guerrilla group in an apparent ""exchange."" In retur n, the ELN apparently gave the FARC permission to establish one of their concentration zones in Carrizal, also in Antioquia. Additionally, both guerrillas have been battling in El Bagre against the Urabenos, the most powerful drug trafficking organization in the country. A FARC return to this territory could generate even more violence. A worrying scenario could also unfold in the port city of Tumaco in Narino department, an area already gripped by violence between various criminal groups. In preparation for their planned demobilization, the local FARC faction had apparently given militia members permission to detach from the larger structure and continue managing illegal activities, rather than join the the peace process. According to some reports, these militia members have since allied with the Urabenos, who have been increasing their presence in Narino. Should the FARC try to return to business as usual in Tumaco, this could be met by fierce resistance by the area's newly dominant criminal powers. At the same time, it is possible that certain FARC factions choose not to return to their old strongholds. Even some opponents of the rejected peace deal have called to activate the planned concentration zones, stating this would ensure the guerrillas' safety and prevent violence that could further disrupt the peace process. However, such a development could come with the risk that areas formerly under FARC control would experience a power vacuum that could be filled by the Urabenos, the ELN, or other armed actors, rather than government forces. Under the terms of the rejected peace deal, the state would have begun trying to establish a presence in these largely rural areas -- many of which have seen little to no government activity for decades -- by improving infrastructure and access to social services. In addition, the designated concentration zones would have immediately seen a boost in the presence of government security forces. But without the presence of either the FARC or the state, some of Colombia's most ungoverned areas may be left more even more vulnerable than before. Prison and Extradition While much of the current debate around the future of the peace process has revolved around the standoff between the Santos administration and the ""No"" campaign, the demands of the FARC leadership are as important as ever. Public opposition to the peace deal has largely centered on the part of the agreement that would have allowed most FARC members to avoid prison sentences and extradition for their crimes. But the FARC have made it clear that this is a non-negotiable condition for their agreement to any peace accord. If the ""No"" campaign insists on seeking prison time or extradition for the rebels -- and particularly if the government agrees to such a demand -- it could spur guerrilla fighters and their leaders to abandon the peace process. Democratic Center delegate Oscar Ivan Zuluaga recently suggested to InSight Crime that extradition may be back on the table, as negotiators from the ""No"" campaign"" would be pushing for drug trafficking to not be considered a pardonable crime. The removal of drug trafficking from the amnesty list proposed by the government and the FARC would leave guerrillas far more exposed to extradition; at least 50 FARC leaders are apparently wanted in the US for such crimes. For now, however, it appears unlikely that the United States will push for the extradition of FARC members. In 2015, US Ambassador to Colombia Kevin Whitaker stated that his country would respect Colombia's decision to refuse extradition requests as a ""contribution to the peace process."" A spokesperson from the US Embassy in Bogota confirmed this stance to InSight Crime on October 5, adding that the United States would nonetheless ""keep asking"" for the extradition of those suspected of violating US laws. Even more problematic could be the issue of jail time. Zuluaga told InSight Crime that the ""No"" campaign has been requesting 6-year prison sentences for guerrillas accused of crimes against humanity. Also among its proposals are ""farming colonies"" as alternative confinement areas. For now though, Colombia's attorney general has confirmed that arrest warrants against FARC rebels remain suspended. What happens next depends largely on how the opposition's ongoing discussions with the government play out, and on how the FARC choose to react."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Venezuela Sentences Low-Ranking Military in Air France Cocaine Bust. Authorities in Venezuela sentenced 10 individuals for trafficking 1.4 tons of cocaine on an Air France flight in 2013, but the convicted did not include any high-level military officials -- whose participation was almost certainly necessary for such a huge drug operation to occur. Three of the nine people sentenced to 22.5 years in prison are members of the Bolivarian National Guard (Guardia Nacional Bolivariana - GNB), Venezuela's Attorney General's Office announced on August 16. One other individual received a 10-year prison sentence. Prosecutors say all of those convicted were involved in smuggling the cocaine aboard a September 2013 Air France flight from Caracas to Paris. French authorities at the time called it the biggest drug bust in that country's history. One of the convicted GNB officers handled a drug-sniffing dog, a second was an X-ray operator, and the third was in charge of counting inventory, according to the government's press release. The GNB oversees security at Venezuela's airports. The other seven individuals were airport personnel. Charges against 17 other suspects, including a lieutenant colonel, are still pending. The Attorney General's Office, known locally as the Public Ministry, also said that the alleged financier of the drug trafficking operation was extradited to Venezuela last week from Colombia, where he had been arrested in September 2015. Given the level to which the GNB controls Venezuela's airports and the huge amount of cocaine loaded onto the flight, it's hard to imagine that the highest ranking military officers involved in the Air France bust were canine handlers and X-ray operators. ""This was the most audacious [smuggling operation] in Venezuela 's history,"" Javier Mayorca, a Venezuelan journalist who investigated the case, told InSight Crime in 2013. ""And it is absolutely unthinkable, impossible, that it was carried out without [military] cooperation at the very highest levels."" (Mayorca is now a contributor to InSight Crime.) Indeed, the Air France case became emblematic of the extent to which Venezuela's military has deepened its involvement in drug trafficking. Cells of corrupt military officials, known collectively as the ""Cartel of the Suns,"" are believed to have strong links to Venezuela's cocaine trade, and the airports have become one of the principal dispatch points for drug shipments. The headline of a September 2014 Washington Post article derisively reads: ""Now boarding at a Venezuelan airport: cocaine."" The recent convictions are part of a pattern developing in Venezuela, in which only low-ranking military officials are charged in high-level drug busts. Just this month, four National Guard members -- none of whom were ranked higher than first lieutenant -- were charged with conspiring to ship some 600 kilos of cocaine on a flight from Caracas to Mexico City."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Off the Beaten Path, Chile Still Caught in Drug Supply Chain. A key source of drug precursor chemicals, and with domestic cocaine consumption that's among the highest in Latin America, Chile is quietly increasing its counter-narcotics efforts. In two particular low-key moves in early October, the Chilean administration of Sebastian Pinera upped its anti-drug efforts with the announcement of the Northern Border Plan, and the purchase of an unknown quantity of Israeli Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, or drones). The plan, which will come into effect in 2013 at a cost of $76 million, has one simple, but very important objective, as Interior and Public Security Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter put it : to stop drugs entering Chile. Though it has not been explicitly stated, the drones look set to form a central part of the Plan, in light of Defense Minister Andres Allemand's declaration that they would become operational within the same time frame. In addition, Allamand announced in January that Chile's new satellite, FASat-Charlie, launched in December last year, could be incorporated into the fight against trafficking. All of these moves fall under Pinera's four-year Plan Secure Chile , a drive by the president to address crime in general, which includes specific elements to combat the country's drug problem through both enforcement measures and treatment programs for users. Sharing a border with two of the world's top cocaine producers -- Bolivia and Peru -- makes Chile's involvement in the narcotics trade a virtual inevitability. However, unlike its northern neighbors, Chile is strictly a drug-consuming nation. With Brazil and Argentina, it accounts for two thirds of cocaine consumption in Latin America and the Caribbean. Alone, it makes up 10 percent, according to the UN's 2011 World Drug Report. Not only does its status as a relatively wealthy consumer market make the country an attractive target for drug traffickers looking to expand their markets, but the country's geographical location and superior infrastructure make it a major transit point for drugs, particularly those coming from Bolivia. Minister Hinzpeter said last year that, of the 140 overland drug routes into Chile , 106 come from Bolivia. Furthermore, of the nearly 7 tons of cocaine seized abroad on Chilean ships between January 2009 and July 2011, the vast majority was found in Bolivian containers that had passed through Chile's ports. Confonting Chilean authorities is also the prospect of having to control and track the movement of precursor chemicals from Chile heading north. With one of the largest petrochemical industries in the region, Chile is a prime source of chemicals used in the production of illegal narcotics. The* 2011 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) highlighted the use of chemicals of Chilean origin in processing coca base in Peru and Bolivia, and the shipment of Chilean ephedrine to Mexico, where it is used to produce methamphetamine. As the INCSR notes, Chile's police have been far more active in recent years with regards to narcotics control, taking part in 20 percent more drug-related operations between March and September 2010 than in the same period in 2009, while arrests for drug offenses were up 28 percent. This coincides with recent reports that crime is on the rise in Chile, with the number of crimes reported in 2011 up 10.6 percent on the previous year. Despite the rising level of interdictions and arrests, Chile*has not covered all bases in terms of combating crime and drug trafficking. The INCSR notes the lack of funding provided to the national drug control council, CONACE (now SENDA), for its monitoring of petrochemicals. Chile's prosecutors are also underfunded , leaving them struggling to cope with rising crime. However, Chile remains unlikely to experience any serious growth in the influence of drug trafficking organizations. It boasts some of the strongest political institutions in the region and the lowest level of corruption, according to Transparency International's 2011 ratings. It lacks, furthermore, any notable domestic criminal structures. Chile can't change its neighbors, however, and neither the domestic demand for cocaine nor the supply from Bolivia and Peru seem likely to abate in the near future. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Illegal Mining Linked to Environmental, Health Emergency in Peru. The Peruvian government has announced a 60-day state of emergency in the southwestern state of Madre de Dios due to mercury contamination linked to illegal mining, highlighting the environmental dangers posed by this illicit business. The emergency measures were announced in a decree published in the official gazette, El Peruano, which states that the purpose of the state of emergency is to ""execute immediate and necessary actions of response and rehabilitation aimed at reducing the harmful effects caused by this situation."" As this video from the non-profit group Pure Earth explains, rudimentary gold mining operations around the world commonly use mercury to help separate gold from the soil in which it is contained, often leading to mercury pollution in surrounding areas. A recent report from Peru's National Civil Defense Institute (Instituto Nacional de Defensa Civil - INDECI) warned that hundreds of people in Madre de Dios live in areas where they could be exposed to dangerously high levels of mercury. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, mercury exposure can cause serious damage to vital organ systems, and can even be deadly. However, El Comercio reports that many local community members, including the state's governor, Luis Otsuka, are opposed to the declaration of the state of emergency. Illegal mining accounts for a large portion of the Madre de Dios economy -- more than 50 percent by some estimates. In addition to mercury contamination, the illegal mining industry has also contributed to deforestation in Madre de Dios, as shown by these satellite photos published in April by El Comercio. According to recent estimates , illegal mining accounts for more than a quarter of the gold mined in Peru and generates some $2.6 billion per year in revenues. This lucrative illicit business not only contributes to environmental damage, but it also intersects with other criminal enterprises such as human trafficking and money laundering. As InSight Crime has previously pointed out , combating illegal mining has proven difficult for a number of reasons. One is the sheer profitability of the trade, which can be more profitable than the drug business by some accounts. A major difficulty in tackling the illegal gold trade stems from the challenge of proving when legal business entities are knowingly or negligently dealing with black market products. Gold importers are normally required to ensure their purchases come from legitimate sources, but proof of origin documentation can be falsified, allowing illegally-mined gold to enter the legitimate market."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Fmr El Salvador President Ordered to Trial on Corruption Charges. Former El Salvador President Francisco Flores has been ordered to stand trial on corruption charges, adding to the lengthy list of current and former Latin American heads of state to come under judicial scrutiny in 2015. On December 3, Judge Miguel Angel Garcia Arguello determined there was sufficient evidence to try former President Francisco Flores (1999 - 2004) on corruption charges, reported The Guardian. According to El Faro , Flores faces four criminal accusations: Embezzlement - Flores allegedly diverted $10 million in donations from Taiwan intended for earthquake victims in 2001 to bank accounts in Costa Rica. This money was later transferred to accounts belonging to his Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) party, and some of the money allegedly helped finance the 2004 presidential campaign of ARENA's Antonio Saca (El Salvador's president from 2004 to 2009). Money laundering - Judge Arguello held that another $5 million in Taiwanese donations that was hidden or disappeared -- possibly in Flores' personal accounts -- constituted money laundering and not illicit enrichment, as prosecutors originally argued. Illicit enrichment - Flores had an unexplained increase in wealth of around $340,000. Disobedience - Flores apparently failed to report to an appointment with a special committee that was investigating the Taiwanese donations. The charge of embezzlement alone carries a possible prison sentence of up to 15 years. If convicted on multiple charges, Flores could receive over 20 years in prison. Allegations against Flores first surfaced in 2013, when then-president Mauricio Funes -- a member of the rival Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) party -- disclosed a US Treasury Department suspicious activities report regarding the Taiwanese donations. Following the judge's ruling, Flores was transferred to a police prison cell to be held in preventative detention. He has been under house arrest since November 2014. Flores has maintained his innocence , saying all the money received from Taiwan was handled properly. In Latin America, 2015 has been notable for the large number of high-profile corruption scandals, with multiple current and former political leaders being subjected to judicial proceedings. Central America's Northern Triangle region (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras) has been the eye of the political storm. In September, Otto Perez Molina resigned as Guatemalan president and was arrested shortly thereafter on charges related to a customs fraud scandal. In Honduras, President Juan Orlando Hernandez also came under intense scrutiny for his links to an embezzlement scandal in that country's social security administration (although he has not faced charges). Some observers have claimed the region is experiencing a "" Central America Spring ,"" owing to these revelations of corruption and the corresponding anti-impunity demonstrations. Similar corruption allegations have arisen in Brazil. President Dilma Roussef and her predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , have come under increasing pressure due to a widening corruption scandal at the state-owned oil company, Petrobras. Additionally, on December 3, an impeachment process was opened against Rousseff for alleged fiscal improprieties. Moving forward in El Salvador, the pending trial against Flores -- if prosecuted competently and fairly -- may mark an important milestone for the country's notoriously weak judicial system, which until now has consistently failed to hold elites accountable for their illicit activity."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

"Honduras Busts Sinaloa Cartel Drug Network. Honduran officials dismantled a network involved in synthetic drug production that is reportedly linked to Mexico 's Sinaloa Cartel , seizing some $100 million in assets. On November 24, agents from Honduras' anti-narcotics agency DLCN arrested seven people in a raid against the organization, reported El Heraldo. DLCN spokesman Carlos Vallecillo said the seizures were some of the biggest to be made against organized crime in Honduras in the last decade, reported Reuters. According to Vallecillo, some 83 arrest warrants issued as part of the operation are still outstanding, against individuals from countries including Mexico, Honduras, Colombia and Guatemala. The operation was carried out across 24 sites in the north of the country, seizing goods including some 700 head of cattle and 144 vehicles. Among those arrested were a local police sub-commissioner and two Colombian pilots. El Heraldo reported that the group was linked to the Sinaloa Cartel, though Honduran officials have yet to publicly confirm this. It is highly plausible that the drug network was connected to the Mexican criminal organization. Reports emerged early last year that Mexican gangs were increasing their presence in Honduras, with the Sinaloa Cartel being one of the main organizations active in the country. Mexican newspaper El Universal reported in August that Sinaloa boss Joaquin "" El Chapo "" Guzman used Honduras as a base for his cartel's operations, and might occasionally hide out in the country. The Sinaloa Cartel is a key player in Central America's methamphetamine trade, having shifted its production south in response to pressure from the authorities. Honduras is still not as important a production site for methamphetamine as Guatemala or Mexico. The seizure earlier this year of $6 million worth of meth precursor chemicals heading to the country, however, indicates that its importance in the trade may be increasing."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"How a Guatemala Drug Trafficker Operated in Honduras. Intelligence reports obtained by the media in Honduras show how a captured drug trafficker and cocaine thief from Guatemala operated with the complicity of Honduran officials, highlighting the importance of Honduras in Central American drug operations. According to intelligence reports accessed by El Heraldo , Honduran officials provided Jairo Orellana Morales, alias ""El Pelon,"" and his collaborators with falsified documents that facilitated their drug trafficking operations in the border region. Members of Honduras' national police also allegedly gave Orellana protection that allowed him to operate in Honduras for years. The reports also provided insight into El Pelon's operations in Honduras, identifying him as the author of various revenge killings in San Pedro Sula and detailing his role as a cocaine thief who set up drug deals, then murdered the suppliers and stole their shipments. The new details of Orellana's operations emerged shortly after authorities seized 17 properties and four businesses, and froze 22 bank accounts in San Pedro Sula and Santa Cruz de Yojoa thought to be associated with Orellana's front men in Honduras. Orellana, who was captured in May , operated in the Guatemala-Honduras border region from an early age. He was known for his shifting loyalties and his predilection for ""tumbes"" (drug robberies), which earned him the title ""The King of Theft"" and nearly got him killed on at least one occasion. For years, Orellana was associated with the Lorenzana clan, which operated principally in the Guatemalan provinces of Zacapa and Chiquimula. He had a child with the daughter of the family patriarch. He also became an important business partner of the Zetas -- who maintained links with the Lorenzanas -- after they began operating in the region. However, as the Zetas' influence declined in Guatemala, and Orellana's relationship with the Lorenzanas soured, he reportedly began selling cocaine to rival groups in Mexico, including the Sinaloa Cartel. El Pelon's operations on the Honduran side of the border are no secret. He operated particularly in the Copan province, which is home to the Valles criminal group, and likely relied on their support for his operations -- although this may have changed after he reportedly stole a major cocaine shipment from the group in 2012. The latest reports help illustrate the extent of Orellana's' influence in Honduras, and how this network of support facilitated his operations. Honduran police are notoriously corrupt , and the border region, where there is little central state presence , is particularly vulnerable to criminal influence in politics ."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombian Airline Executive to Testify on Venezuela Drug Flights. A Colombian airline executive has turned himself over to US authorities and is expected to testify about drug flights leaving Venezuela. However, it is not a given that his testimony will directly implicate high-level traffickers. On January 8, Jorge Enrique Perez Ruiz, the former owner of the now-defunct Colombian airline West Caribbean Airways, quietly turned himself over to US authorities, reported El Tiempo. According to the details of a plea bargain negotiated over a period of eight months, Perez Ruiz was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in piloting a drug flight between Panama and Venezuela's Apure state, a known drug trafficking hub, with the intention of collecting a shipment of cocaine ultimately bound for the United States. The former executive will be eligible for parole after having served two years of his sentence. The plea bargain and sentencing deal reportedly take into account Perez Ruiz's promise to offer authorities his ""total cooperation."" Court documents also reveal that Perez Ruiz has aided authorities in carrying out undercover investigations. This latest development is just one of many recent high-profile efforts on behalf of the US Justice Department to go after drug trafficking networks in Venezuela, including bringing charges against high-ranking officials in the security forces and relatives of President Nicolas Maduro. Perez Ruiz's cooperation means the US has added another viable witness to the cadre of former drug traffickers, and at least one defected security chief , who are working with authorities to build cases against trafficking rings in Venezuela. Of particular interest to US authorities is any information that could further unmask the Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns), a term used to refer to a drug trafficking network made up of high-ranking officials in the Venezuelan military and security forces. While Perez Ruiz will surely be able to offer operational details about drug flights in Venezuela, specifically those leaving Apure state, it remains to be seen whether he will be able to implicate any specific individuals, let alone security or military officers who might be members of the Cartel de los Soles. While the Cartel de los Soles is thought to be active in Apure state, so are other drug trafficking groups such as Colombian guerrilla group the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia).

"Costa Ricas Next President Lacks Plan to Tackle Rising Insecurity. Voters in Costa Rica just chose their next president, but the incoming head of state doesn't seem to have a coherent plan for tackling record levels of violence in the country related to its growing role in the regional drug trade. Carlos Alvarado Quesada of the center-left Citizens' Action Party (Partido Accion Ciudadana - PAC) was elected as Costa Rica's next president on April 1, beating out conservative candidate Fabricio Alvarado Munoz with just over 60 percent of the vote. Despite the fact that Costa Rica saw its most homicidal year on record in 2017, rising insecurity took a back seat to other issues during the campaign. Candidates focused more on social and economic matters, including the rights of LGBT people, the country's national debt and a wide-ranging corruption case involving Costa Rica's cement sector. Despite clear signs of rising insecurity in Costa Rica related to the country's growing role in the international drug trade, President-elect Alvarado has failed to put forth a clear plan for turning back the tide of increasing violence and criminality. Officials in Costa Rica are well aware that organized crime-related violence is on the rise. According to a September 2017 government report, organized crime is "" driving the rise "" in homicides in the country. An estimated 25 percent of homicides in 2017 were linked to the drug trade, according to authorities. But despite this recognition, President-elect Alvarado's rhetoric on security policy thus far has been vague and inconsistent. Indeed, Alvarado has proposed enhancing the infrastructure and training of the national police and strengthening citizen security programs as part of preventative efforts designed to combat crime. Improved police training is essential in light of a questionable move by the government last year to reduce training requirements in order to rapidly put more cops on the street. But Alvarado's proposal lacks any specifics regarding what these improvements might look like and how they will address some of the root causes driving violence in Costa Rica. Alvarado's proposals for attacking organized crime also lack clarity. The president-elect has addressed one root cause of rising violence -- access to firearms -- by calling for stricter gun control and establishing a gun registry to better trace weapons. But Latin America is awash with illegal guns used by criminal groups, and it's unlikely that a registry alone can get them out of the hands of criminals. Alvarado has also proposed an asset forfeiture law in Costa Rica, a controversial tool used by authorities throughout the region to go after the finances of criminal groups. However, little evidence suggests that such a policy would do much to roll back deepening insecurity, particularly in the short term. Moreover, Alvarado's Citizens' Action Party doesn't even have specific sections on crime and security outlined in their platform. It remains to be seen whether the new government will outline more concrete policy proposals regarding insecurity in Costa Rica, which has already set a new record for homicides throughout the first three months of 2018."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Is Europes Cocaine Market Becoming Saturated?A new report on European drug markets suggests a significant decline in cocaine use among the continent's principal consumer countries, which could have consequences for drug trafficking organizations in Latin America. Cocaine consumption fell considerably between 2008 and 2013 in many of the European countries with the biggest demand for the illicit drug, according to the annual European Drug Report ( pdf ), published by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ). The prevalence of cocaine use among young adults (ages 15-34) in Spain dropped from roughly 5.5 percent in 2008 to just over 3 percent in 2013, according to the report. The United Kingdom (UK) also experienced a fall in consumption during that same period from over 6 percent to slightly more than 4 percent. France is the only selected European country that bucked the downward trend, and has seen steadily increasing cocaine usage since the early 2000s. Overall trends also indicate the purity of cocaine found in Europe has risen, while prices have fallen slightly, according to the report. European authorities seized about 63 tons of cocaine in 2013, with Spain accounting for roughly 40 percent of that figure. Cocaine seizures in Europe have remained relatively stable since 2010, the report states. The overall decrease in cocaine consumption in prominent European user nations, along with the increasing purity and declining price of the illicit drug, indicates consumer markets on the continent may be contracting, or at least heading in that direction. This trend would reverse the long-standing expansion of consumer markets for cocaine on the continent. A significant decrease in cocaine consumption would likely negatively impact transnational drug trafficking groups based in Latin America. Colombian criminal organizations have responded to Mexican dominance of a saturated US consumer market and higher wholesale prices for cocaine in Europe by taking on a bigger role in the illicit drug trade in Spain. Sources within the Spanish police have told InSight Crime Colombian criminal groups now control cocaine trafficking in the country. Several European law enforcement agencies have also noted the growing presence of Mexican drug cartels in Spain and various other parts of the continent. But reduced prices and demand for cocaine in Europe would mean less profits for Mexican and Colombian drug trafficking groups operating there. Under this scenario, these groups may consider migrating some of their operations to what appears to be growing cocaine markets in Eastern Europe. However, changing underworld dynamics may complicate matters. The 2014 European Drug Report stated criminal organizations in Eastern Europe have taken advantage of the fragmentation of Mexican and Colombian organized crime by assuming a more prominent role in the region's illicit drug trade.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Central America Elites Continue Onslaught Against Anti-Graft Commissions. Elites in Guatemala and Honduras are continuing their campaign to defang anti-corruption commissions in their respective countries with a series of new moves aimed at getting rid of the independent bodies or severely hampering their capabilities. On March 18, Guatemala's Interior Minister Enrique Dagenhart announced the transfer of 11 agents who had previously worked with the United Nations-backed anti graft body known as the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG). In response, CICIG head Ivan Velasquez released a statement to Dagenhart demanding the return of the agents and an explanation for the transfer. On March 21, Dagenhart replied that the move would be ""temporary."" In neighboring Honduras, recent press reports revealed that a group of lawyers representing five congressman who have been indicted on charges of corruption submitted a case earlier this month to the Supreme Court seeking to declare the Support Mission against Corruption and Impunity (Mision de Apoyo contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad en Honduras - MACCIH) unconstitutional. Additionally, on March 20, the congress passed a law reforming asset forfeiture procedures to prevent it from being applied retroactively, among other things. Critics argued that the law was meant to protect corrupt elites from having the proceeds of their illicit activities seized by authorities. The recent attempts by entrenched elites to undermine the CICIG and the MACCIH are a continuation of stepped-up efforts to derail anti-graft drives in recent months. A law passed in Honduras in January essentially stripped the ability of the Attorney General's Office to effectively investigate the management of public funds. The passage of the law spurred the resignation of MACCIH head Juan Jimenez Mayor, who called it an "" impunity pact ."" The most recent attempt to challenge the constitutionality of MACCIH has the potential to terminate the commission altogether. The future of MACCIH is now in the hands of the Supreme Court, which is packed with allies of current President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who himself has faced allegations of corruption. A similar trend has been observed in Guatemala, where corrupt elites have ramped up attempts to curb high-level corruption investigations. One of the most blatant recent moves against the CICIG came in late 2017 when President Jimmy Morales unsuccessfully tried to remove Velazquez, the body's top official, from the country. Since then, the Morales administration has taken other steps to undermine anti-corruption efforts, including firing the head of Guatemala's tax agency, Juan Francisco Solorzano Foppa, who led high-profile corruption investigations targeting members of Guatemala's top brass. And in March, Interior Minister Degenhart ousted national police director Nery Ramos y Ramos along with several of his top advisors in a move that was widely condemned as an attempt to interfere with ongoing graft investigations."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Caracas Counts Over 3,000 Homicides So Far in 2012. Venezuela 's capital registered 3,218 homicides during the first 10 months of 2012, putting it on pace to surpass last year's total and indicating that clashes between street gangs remain one of the primary drivers of violence in the city. The statistics are taken from the Venezuelan national police agency the CICPC, reported El Universal. According to the CICPC's numbers, 70 percent of the homicides in Caracas and the surrounding metropolitan area were related to armed assaults. The definition appears to encompass armed robbery, as well as confrontations between street gangs. There are thought to be hundreds of gangs in Caracas, usually no more than seven to 10 people defending small chunks of territory. Caracas' municipality of Libertador -- where the presidential palace and many other government buildings are based, alongside poorer neighborhoods like the 23 de Enero -- remains the most violent, with 2,580 murders registered so far this year, or about 258 murders a month. In comparison, the other four municipalities in the Caracas metropolitan district registered 638 homicide victims between January and October 2012. Last year Caracas registered 3,488 homicides in total, according to the CICPC. In the past, the police agency's numbers have been slightly smaller than those kept by NGO the Venezuelan Violence Observatory , which reported 19,336 homicide victims in Venezuela last year, compared to the CICPC's count of 18,850. The NGO called 2011 Venezuela's most violent year ever. The homicide tally is an indication that consolidating security in Caracas will remain a challenge for President Hugo Chavez as he begins his fourth term. The CICPC data suggests that 2012 could turn out to be even more violent than 2011 , if murders continue at the same pace. The government has taken a few steps to try and stem violence in the capital, including overhauling the city police and encouraging disarmament schemes. But a weak judiciary means few are punished for committing crimes, leaving Caracas' street gangs essentially with free reign to deal drugs and kill one another over petty rivalries, with little intervention from the authorities. Even with increased evidence that organized crime is deepening its hold inside the country , it appears that urban street gangs will remain the primary drivers of violence in the capital.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Guatemala Journalists Killed by Drug Transport Gang: Govt. Nearly a week after two journalists were murdered in southern Guatemala, the government has implicated a local criminal group with commercial ties to the government in the killings. Guatemala's Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla said the so-called Oajaca group may have been behind the March 10 attack that killed reporters Danilo Lopez and Federico Salazar, and injured a third, Marvin Tunchez, El Periodico reported. The criminal network -- which carries the name of the principal family that allegedly manages it -- works with Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, the minister said, coordinating the arrival and dispatch of illegal drug shipments along its Pacific coastline. It also manages government contracts, including one from the Health Ministry to supply water to a local hospital and another from the judicial system to rent a building for an unspecified use, according to Prensa Libre. Police have arrested two suspects in the shooting, one of whom allegedly had connections to arms trafficking and a record as a hired assassin, according to Prensa Libre. The prosecutor in the case recently requested it be moved to a special court outside of Suchitepequez due to risks faced by witnesses, prosecutors, and judges. After an enormous outcry from a range of Guatemalan organizations, the United Nations, and the Committee to Protect Journalists, the government announced new protection mechanisms for journalists in Mazatenango, the city where Lopez and Salazar were killed. Lopez's reporting cut to the heart of a critical issue throughout the region: the intimate connections between criminal actors and the political establishment, especially on a local level where they trade campaign funding for protection and government contracts. In interviews released posthumously by Prensa Libre, Lopez detailed how criminal groups contributed to political campaigns and controlled authorities with relative ease in part because of their patronage and in part because of their strong-arm tactics. Lopez had faced down threats in the past. In a 2013 complaint to the Attorney General's Office, Lopez said he was threatened by the mayor of the Suchitepequez municipality San Lorenzo after reporting the mayor had embezzled public funds. Threats against journalists in Guatemala are on the rise. According to an Attorney General's Office spokesperson quoted by Prensa Libre, there have been 142 complaints made by journalists since 2010, with the numbers increasing every year. Instead of formally requesting government protection, many journalists self-censor when they are harassed or threatened. In a report detailing the dangers faced by the press in Central America, the Committee to Protect Journalists noted that coverage of organized crime in rural areas has become increasingly difficult. The report added that reporters rely on official government announcements and rarely venture outside major cities.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"US Warns of Rise in Secret Tunnels Under Mexico Border. U.S. officials said that illegal tunnels running under the border with Mexico are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated. James Dinkins of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) told the Senate that 154 illicit tunnels crossing the border have been discovered since 1990. ""Over the past several years, law enforcement has seen a marked increase in the number and sophistication of tunnels,"" said the official. He said most of these passageways, used to traffic drugs and humans, were located on the southwest part of the border. In November 2010 a border task force found a tunnel half a mile long equipped with rail, electricity and ventilation systems. The construction cost of the tunnel was estimated to exceed one million dollars. A shorter tunnel, also with ventilation and electricity, was found in May on the Arizona border. At the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein announced plans enhance a 2007 law against the tunnels. She proposed that the bill provide law enforcers ""additional tools to locate tunnels, identify criminals and punish those involved."" "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Arrests Point to FARC Ties to Al Qaeda in North Africa. Colombia's largest insurgency, the FARC, has allegedly been exchanging drugs for weapons with the North Africa faction of Al Qaeda, highlighting the international reach of the guerrilla's criminal networks. In March, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) arrested two Colombians, one an alleged member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), along with three alleged members of a Salafist group linked to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in Algeria on drug trafficking charges, according to the Spanish news organization Cadena Ser. The Colombians were allegedly delivering a shipment of cocaine to swap for cash, and arms acquired in Libya following the fall of dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. Spanish intelligence and DEA sources told Cadena Ser that several months before, FARC collaborators had made contact with members of AQIM, who had arranged the deal through members of a local Salafist group operating under their orders. The AQIM is a faction of Al Qaeda with roots in Algeria but which recently rose to prominence for its role in the conflict in northern Mali. Unlike more zealous factions of Al Qaeda, the group has frequently demonstrated it is willing to fund itself through criminal activities such as drug trafficking and kidnapping for ransom. It is quite possible that, as the investigation suggests, the group has established ties with the FARC. They share a mutual hatred of the United States. However, given the two groups' disparate ideologies, this is much more likely to be a purely criminal business relationship than any sort of political alliance.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
Ecuador Finds Coca Plantation on Colombia Border. Ecuador's Army spotted a two hectare cocaine plantation on the border with Colombia on April 19 on an aerial surveillance. The site was investigated by the Technical Inter-agency Illicit Crop Monitoring Committee (Comite Tecnico Interinstitucional de Monitoreo de Cultivos Ilicitos - COTIMON) on April 28. They found 32,000 plants ready to harvest and a greenhouse with over 26,000 plants prepared to be moved, reported La Hora. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Last Rastrojos Leader Surrenders to US. The last known leader of the Rastrojos drug gang, Luis Enrique Calle Serna , has handed himself in to the US, raising the likelihood this once mighty trafficking organization could be seeing its final days. Calle Serna delivered himself to US authorities in Panama on October 2, and was immediately transferred to a New York jail, reported Semana. He had been negotiating with US authorities for some time -- Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos confirmed in February that Calle Serna and his brother Javier, alias "" Comba ,"" were seeking to surrender. According to Colombian National Police, the arrest of kingpin Daniel "" El Loco "" Barrera on September 18 triggered Luis Enrique's surrender, as El Loco had been responsible for providing the Rastrojos leader with security in Venezuela, where he was living. The police added that following El Loco's arrest, Luis Enrique contacted his family in Spain to let them know he would surrender, and informed the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) of the decision through his lawyer. Comba delivered himself to the US authorities in May. This was followed a month later by the arrest of another top Rastrojos commander, Diego Perez Henao, alias "" Diego Rastrojo ,"" in Venezuela. Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon said that Luis Enrique's surrender was evidence that the pressure applied by security forces leaves drug traffickers with no other option than to turn themselves in. Luis Enrique was the last remaining leader of the Rastrojos - the former armed wing of the Norte del Valle Cartel -- and his detention throws the survival of the group into doubt. Even before Diego Rastrojo and Comba fell, there were reports of infighting between the faction commanded by the Calle Sernas, Los Comba, and Diego Rastrojo's faction, due to disagreement over whether to negotiate a surrender. The loss of Comba and Diego Rastrojo caused more turmoil, as rival gangs, particularly the Urabenos , made incursions into the Rastrojos stronghold of Valle del Cauca province. Yet another leader was picked off this week, when Jose Leonardo Rodriguez Guevara, alias ""Pinky,"" was captured in Bogota. He was second-in-command to Jose Leonardo Hortua Blandon, alias ""Mascota,"" who reportedly took over Diego Rastrojo's faction after his arrest. If Mascota only controls one faction, he is unlikely to be able to replace the Calle Sernas and Diego Rastrojo. According to police, the Rastrojos have been losing manpower, with membership down some 20 percent over the last two years to 1,656 fighters, reported El Tiempo. Luis Enrique's surrender could cause this to dwindle further, as previously loyal fighters defect to other, stronger groups. There have been reports of this already in the fiercely contested Bajo Cauca region in Colombia, where Rastrojos members have gone over to the rival Urabenos. Luis Enrique's decision to surrender, along with the fact he was living in Venezuela, points to the difficulty traffickers face in running their operations once their profile gets too high, especially if they are wanted by the United States. It is also possible that the surrender of the Combas was motivated by threats to their families. Victor Patino Fomeque, a former member of the Cali Cartel who served a reduced sentence of just over seven years in the United States after collaborating with the DEA, returned to Colombia in 2010 and began waging a war against the Rastrojos. Part of his motive is reportedly the murder of at least 35 members of his family by the Rastrojos, and the Calle Sernas' relatives would be a likely target for revenge attacks. The brothers' surrender deal may have involved protection for their families from the United States. Regardless of what triggered Luis Enrique's surrender, one thing is certain: his removal from the picture has served to weaken the Rastrojos further, and likely means that this once powerful drug trafficking gang has seen out its last days as a unified force in Colombia's underworld."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Paraguay Has Nothing to Show for State of Emergency, Again. Half way through a 60-day state of emergency imposed by the Paraguayan government, there have been no real blows struck against the EPP guerrilla group -- unsurprisingly for those who claim the rebels do not exist. Paraguay declared the ""state of exception"" on October 10 in the northern provinces of Concepcion and San Pedro, following an attack against a police post in Concepcion which killed two officers, carried out by the Paraguayan People's Army (EPP). The measure puts the army on the streets in these areas, suspends some constitutional rights, and allows detention without a warrant. Like the 60-day state of exception declared in 2010, the measure has brought little or no progress against the EPP so far. Officials reported in late October that ""various"" people had been arrested while the measures have been in place, but none from the EPP. Vice President Federico Franco told press that he was sceptical about the emergency measures and did not expect any real results against the EPP, saying Saturday ""I agree with the people, nothing is going to happen."" One impact the measures have seemingly had, however, is inciting the EPP to carry out an attack on a ranch in Hugua Nandu, Concepcion, in what was reportedly an act of revenge after the owners let the army use the land for operations. On the grounds of the ranch, after the attack, was found a photo of two EPP members killed in 2010. The measure has been widely criticized, not least by Paraguayan lawmakers. The House of Representatives blocked the proposed state of exception in September after it had been passed by the Senate, with many arguing that the move was totally unjustified. They relented only after a police officer was shot in the back in early October in the same region, in an attack some attributed to the rebels, with the Representatives then passing the measure within hours. Some opposed the declaration on legal grounds, with lawmakers arguing that the situation in the affected provinces is not severe enough to fulfil the requirements for a state of exception. The constitution allows for a state of exception if there is an international armed conflict, or if the functioning of the constitution or its bodies are in danger. The same argument was used by the Paraguayan human rights commission, CODEHUPY, which released a statement arguing that there was no internal upheaval in the provinces affected by the measure, and said that it should not be used as a way to respond to crime. For the body, those committing criminal acts in northern Paraguay should be apprehended and prosecuted under the ordinary legal system, without the need for the imposition of emergency laws. Some have classed the measure as overkill, arguing that the police can carry out law enforcement without the need for backing from the army. Retired General Carlos Liseras memorably described the move as ""sending an elephant to catch mosquitos."" He said that the trouble in the region was caused by ""common criminals,"" and that the police were capable of dealing with it. Critics have questioned the measure's effectiveness, pointing to the fact that the previous year's state of emergency declaration, which lasted for 30 days in five of the country's provinces, had not given any concrete results. Some 180 people were arrested , only one of whom was a member of the guerrilla group. Sending in the military to do police work, and granting further powers to the police, also raises concerns about abuse. In the Congressional debate on the topic, a representative from Concepcion expressed his passionate opposition to the declaration, saying that during the last state of exception those worst affected were the poorest members of society, who saw their rights trampled upon. Amnesty International said that the 2010 state of exception raised concerns about ""torture and other ill-treatment, excessive use of force and procedural irregularities"" on the part of the police. Perhaps the most compelling argument against the state of exception is that it may be chasing after a phantom. Mystery surrounds the question of what the EPP is, and whether it even exists. Commentators in Paraguay have questioned how far the EPP is a rebel entity, arguing that it is instead a group, or groups, of criminals without political aims. Others argue that the EPP does exist as a rebel group, but is too small to justify the government's actions against it. General Liseras said that giving the group, which according to him only has 50 members, the status of guerrillas is giving them what they want to gain international prestige. Some put the numbers even lower. The human rights commission meanwhile put the number of members lower, pointing out; ""to say that an armed group of approximately 15 people is creating tumult and justifies the state of exception is to disregard the failure of the security forces made up of more than 50,000 people."" Even the attack that finally pushed Congress into passing the state of emergency declaration was not clearly the work of the EPP. An officer named Raimundo Pereira was manning a police checkpoint with two others, when at 9:30 p.m., he stood up to hand something to one of his companions and was suddenly shot in the back. Pereira said that he was sure it was a planned attack, and not an accident, but nothing further happened. However, the EPP insist on asserting their existence. The attack that killed two policemen in September was reportedly a well-planned operation involving bombs and sniper fire. A local police commander said that the fact the rebels managed to inflict casualties was due in part to the fact that many officers do not believe the group really exists, and so do not take the proper precautions. What are the real reasons for the government putting the state of emergency in place, when it proved so little-effective last time? As InSight Crime has argued previously, it could be an attempt to shore up the government of President Fernando Lugo against accusations that he has sympathies with the leftist group, although the president himself is said to be opposed to the declaration. It could also be a way for the authorities being seen to take action against organized crime without having to take difficult steps such as removing corrupt prosecutors and police, as the human rights commission points out. Some have questioned whether the government is really committed to dismantling the EPP, with one congressman stating that ""If there is not political will to capture [the EPP rebels], it's not worth the trouble.""

"The Unbelievable Hell Inside El Salvadors Prisons. A plague of fungal skin diseases, untreated deadly infections, constant threats of tuberculosis epidemics, people fed with their own hands, extreme overcrowding and children locked up with their mothers. This is what the human rights observers reported during the first few months of the extraordinary measures implemented across prisons for El Salvador's gang members. The Attorney General's Office is the only institution that has access to these prisons under these extraordinary measures. The government has decided to deny access to the public, including the International Committee of the Red Cross. ""The fact that they are served food in their hands isinhumane. The overcrowdingall in the same cell for 24 hours! It's likethe torture facilities of the past. You would think that all of that was over. You would think that Hitler was a thing of the past. Once the doors are opened, what will we see?"" The statement was from Raquel Caballero, of El Salvador's Attorney General's Office for Human Rights ( Procuradora para la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos - PDDH) , who was left speechless as she tried to describe what she saw in the prisons where the government's extraordinary measures have been implemented. * This article was translated, edited for clarity and length and published with the permission of El Faro. It does not necessarily represent the views of InSight Crime. See the Spanish original here. In April 2016, the government implemented extraordinary measures for seven Salvadoran prisons where only gang members are detained. The aim was to isolate certain prisoners with the understanding that they were the momentum driving gang criminality. In order to do this, the government eliminated family visitation; confined prisoners to their cells 24 hours a day; halted the delivery of hygiene products like soap, toilet paper and toothpaste; suspended judicial proceedings and restricted maximum-security prisoners from being released to hospitals. The measures, which were approved by the heads of all political parties, have been enacted for a year with the possibility of extended. The government is authorized to extend the current state of emergency for prisons month by month. The report from the PDDH -- an report that was compiled during the last months of the previous administration -- describes some of the most serious conditions that the office witnessed from April to July this year. In the Chalatenango prison, which houses the gang members of the MS13, the PDDH tells the story of a prisoner who did not receive medical attention despite having a bullet lodged in his hip, and another prisoner who was also unable to receive medical treatment despite suffering from hypertension, diabetes and obstruction of a coronary vein. Authorities denied medical attention to yet another prisoner who was paraplegic as a result of a bullet to his spine and who had a colostomy, that is to say he defecates through a segment of his intestine that releases though an opening in his abdomen. According to the report, this last prisoner suffers from ""multiple skin lesions due to a lack of healing."" In the San Francisco Gotera prison in Morazan, where gang members of the Barrio 18 Revolucionarios are detained, the PDDH found an outbreak of tuberculosis which the authorities had failed to address. In Ciudad Barrios in San Miguel, a prison exclusively for the MS13, a prisoner with tumors in his head was unable to receive medical attention; nor was medical attention given to another who had plastic intestines that had expired a year ago; nor for the prisoner with a testicular hernia, nor for the prisoner with cancer, nor the hemophiliac; not even for the prisoner with muscular dystrophy, acute poliomyelitis and osteoporosis. The report highlights the historic nature of the prisons' poor conditions, which has only been exacerbated by 24-hour lock-up and lack of access to cleaning products and clean water. In a November 4 interview, an ex-convict recently released from the San Francisco Gotera prison spoke about his experience with the extraordinary measures: ""In sector one, where there are about 350 people, there was only one bathroom, which was clogged, so people made a small pile in the cell, and shit started accumulating there, piling up until water dropped down to take it away. Someone sleeps next to that little pileIn that sector, you have to line up to use the little pile even when you don't need to use the bathroom because if you wait until you have to pee, you'll wet yourself in the line. Outside of the cell there are various bathrooms, but we can't use them because we're locked up."" The ex-convict assured that there are cells that are in better condition, like the smallest of that prison, known as ""the little cell."" There, he explained, are beds for 28 people, even though there are 130 detained there. With any luck there is a hole to urinate and defecate into: it's only a hole in the ground, which at one point connected to a toilet bowl that was there but had been removed by order of the Police Maintenance Unit. He also told how, at the time, some everyday items became luxury goods: ""He has a glass or a plate? Oh man, what a blessing!"" The PDDH report confirms his story: ""In general no prisoner had receptacles with which to receive food. The only thing they had were plastic bottles which had been cut down the center or pieces of plastic bags from which food would spill. The majority received food in their bare hands."" Other prisoners with whom El Faro has spoken recount how some of their cellmates have had hysteric episodes as a result of the permanent lock-up and severe overcrowding. On June 16, Cojutepeque prison was closed as it had become known as the worst of the all of the Salvadoran prisons. The inmates -- all from the Sureno faction of the Barrio 18 -- were transferred to Quezaltepeque and Izalco prisons. Nevertheless, that transfer, according to the PDDH report, ""severely exacerbated the overcrowding in the aforementioned prisons."" The human rights office confirmed that the police confiscated the possessions of the 1,282 inmates who were transferred, forbidding them to enter with their clothes and shoes, and forcing them to wear only their underwear. The report confirms that the inmates were made to sleep on the floor, as they were forbidden to have mattress pads or blankets. They reported that among the transferees were inmates with HIV, tuberculosis and renal failure who were not receiving treatment. It also attests to the fact that ""many"" of the inmates had severe fungal skin infections and as a result had ""infected ulcers."" ""In general no prisoner had receptacles with which to receive food. The only thing they had were plastic bottles which had been cut down the center or pieces of plastic bags from which food would spill. The majority received food in their bare hands."" During the first four months that the extraordinary measures were being exercised in full force, four inmates died due to a lack of medical attention; two of them from diseases that are not cited in the report, one from pneumonia, and the other from malnutrition. In the same time frame, despite the extraordinary measures, 11 inmates were assassinated inside the prisons as a result of internal purges within the gangs. ""They are in subhuman conditions. A total violation of their human rights and the law,"" said prosecutor Caballero. The General Director of Prisons Rodil Hernandez recognized that the conditions generated by the extraordinary measures have exacerbated the already terrible state of Salvadoran prisons. ""The conditions that we have now practically overwhelm any action we can make in the prisons,"" he said. He also admitted that the tuberculosis issue has the potential to become a ""bomb,"" but that ""it is not unusual, considering the current overcrowding we have. It could be worse."" He assured that they have been considering investing more than a million dollars to construct six clinics, including one in the Quezaltepeque prison and one in Chalatenango prison. Hernandez said that the government plans on making million-dollar investments to expand holding capacities and reduce prison overcrowding in the short term. Salvadoran prisons are the most crowded in the entire American continent, and their overpopulation usually lingers around 300 percent. The extraordinary measures have not been responsible for filling the prisons to the brim with gang members, but it has made the overcrowding almost unliveable. According to official data, as of November 8, the overpopulation rate in the Salvadoran penitentiary system was at 270 percent. The Deputy Attorney for Vulnerable Populations Gerardo Alegria said that additionally children under the age of five, who remain with their mothers in the ""maternity"" section of the Quezaltepeque prison, also experience the harsh realities of the measures. They have remained under lock and key for 24 hours a day in the cells they share with their mothers. Director Hernandez confirmed this story: ""The entire population of the prision is under the effect of the measures, but if I am not mistaken we only have three children, and the children also have permission to leave. If they have family on the outside, they can leave with them on the weekend."" Since the implementation of the extraordinary measures, no non-governmental organization has been able to enter the prisons to verify the conditions in which the inmates live, nor the treatment they receive. Not even prestigious human rights organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), with which the Government of El Salvador has a convention that allows ICRC staff access to prisons. In November 2012, the then-Minister of Justice and Public Security David Munguia Payes signed an agreement with the ICRC that would allow the organization as a verifying human rights entity to access the prisons, guaranteeing access to all facilities. However, since the implementation of the extraordinary measures in April, the government has denied the ICRC access to all of the prisons impacted by the measures. According to the general director of prisons, the decision to deny access to the ICRC does not violate the signed agreement because the agreement, he asserts, ""did not specify which prisons they could enter, and which they could not."" The ICRC representative in El Salvador, Dereck Spranger, preferred not to comment on the situation and he only revealed that the dialogue with the government of El Salvador is ""direct and confidential."" The extraordinary measures are the tip of the spear in the government policies of combating crime under President Salvador Sanchez Ceren. The current administration's policies have been characterized by repressive policing, relaxing regulations that prevent human rights violations and the gratuitous use of force by the police and military. * This article was translated, edited for clarity and length and published with the permission of El Faro.

Guatemala Judges Release Suspects in Major Corruption Case. The recent decision of two alternate judges in Guatemala to release 10 people implicated in an extensive customs fraud case that toppled a presidency in 2015 has raised suspicions of improper influence in the country's judiciary. Over the past two weeks, 10 of the more than 30 Guatemalan customs union members facing charges for their involvement in the fraud network known as La Linea were granted prison alternatives while they await their respective trials. La Linea is one of the cases for which former President Otto Perez Molina and former Vice President Roxana Baldetti are currently being held in pretrial detention. Two alternate judges -- Fredy Ariel Leonardo Hernandez and Maria Mercedes Rodriguez -- made the decisions while the judge overseeing the case, Miguel Angel Galvez, was on vacation. Hernandez released seven of the accused on bail, and Rodriguez released three. Among those freed on bail are the former head of Guatemala's Internal Revenue Service (Superintendencia de Administracion Tributaria - SAT), Claudia Mendez, and Melvin Alvarado, the former administrator of the port of Quetzal, the largest seaport on Guatemala's Pacific coast. The judges released the 10 individuals for reasons ranging from alleged medical conditions to deciding they were not flight risks. According to media outlet Prensa Libre , in June 2018 at least 24 customs union members in the case requested alternatives to pretrial detention. Even Perez Molina and Baldetti have made numerous requests for release on the grounds of health concerns, but Judge Galvez has thus far rejected them all. The alternate judges' decision to release to house arrest so many of those charged with involvement in the La Linea scheme sets a disturbing precedent for the future of one of Guatemala's most emblematic corruption cases. The decisions went directly against recommendations from two of the country's major anti-impunity bodies: the Attorney General's Office anti-impunity unit (Fiscalia Especializada Contra la Impunidad - FECI) and the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG). FECI head Juan Francisco Sandoval told InSight Crime that some of the individuals who were released could use their positions at the tax agency to influence witnesses, which would constitute an obstruction of justice. The decision to release the suspects also raises suspicions about how powerful groups could apply pressure to obstruct progress in the La Linea case. The move could be a harbinger for other cases, showing how far corrupt networks will go to interfere with important investigations. Regardless of whether these alternate judges were under pressure, their decisions illustrate more complex, structural problems in Guatemala's justice system. These include a lack of oversight in case assignment to alternate judges and weak legislation for regulating the qualifications of judges and lawyers.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Uruguay Faces Rising Public Pressure to Militarize Fight Against Crime. Authorities in Uruguay are facing mounting public pressure to pursue hardline security strategies to combat a perceived rise in gang-related violence, but caving to these demands could hamper long-term efforts that have made the country one of the safest in Latin America. Amid a perceived spike in homicides and armed robberies in urban areas across the country, Uruguay President Tabare Vazquez told news outlet Busqueda on May 17 that ""soon there will be news"" about his administration's plans to improve coordination between security institutions in the fight against organized crime. President Vazquez's remarks came on the heels of an inflammatory May 12 interview provided to El Observador by Police Chief Mario Layera, in which he accused the government of being too ""scared"" to take ""non-sympathetic measures"" to combat rising gang-related crime that could lead the country into a ""scenario like El Salvador or Guatemala."" In response, Vasquez said that Uruguay is ""really far from that scenario."" Nevertheless, on May 15, his administration submitted a bill to Congress aimed at strengthening coordination between police, prosecutors and the courts, as well as giving police officers ""more flexibility"" and ""legal support"" to do their jobs. While a recent opinion poll showed nearly three out of every four Uruguayans believe that soldiers should collaborate with police in the fight against crime, Vasquez has so far rejected the idea. Earlier this month, the president denied a request to deploy soldiers to Lavalleja, a department northeast of Montevideo where a string of five homicides since February has been attributed to clashes between criminal groups. ""Uruguay is not in a situation of war,"" Vasquez said in defending his response. Sustained public concerns about a perceived rise in violent crime are putting pressure on Uruguayan officials to implement a heavy-handed response. However, the true severity of the rise in violence and the factors fueling it remain unclear, and a poorly planned response could exacerbate insecurity, as has been the case in other countries across the region. Recent fears about rising criminal violence in Uruguay seem to be related mostly to anecdotal and sensationalized media reports. Official statistics show Uruguay's overall homicide rate -- one of the lowest in the region -- has remained relatively stable over the past quarter-century, and has actually been declining since 2015. At the same time, government data shows the proportion of homicides related to clashes between criminal groups may be increasing. In 2012, conflicts between crime groups accounted for 25 percent of all murders, whereas they accounted for 45 percent in 2017 and 58 percent in the first three months of 2018. Uruguay's success in keeping levels of violence low is due in large part to the government's emphasis on professionalizing its police force and using data and technology to efficiently target interventions against crime. However, experiences in countries like Brazil , Mexico , Guatemala and El Salvador have all shown how public pressure over perceptions of insecurity can push governments to implement militarized policies that in most cases have limited long-term efficacy."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The Geographical Breakdown of Mexicos 26,000 Disappeared. A report on the geographical patterns of disappearances in Mexico highlights the country's most embattled regions, outlining the human toll of the internecine conflict between the state and warring criminal groups. The interactive map , published by Univision, examines the disappearances which occurred during the six-year presidency of Felipe Calderon, who left office in December. It exposes a significant gender divide in the patterns of disappearances, with some municipalities, such as Mina in the northeastern state of Nuevo Leon and Yaxcaba in Yucatan State, only registering women as missing. Of the 26,567 disappearances plotted, almost half occurred in the Federal District (DF) of Mexico City, the state of Mexico, and the US border state of Tamaulipas. The Univision map also shows that a few states, such as Nayarit, have registered few disappearances even though they border other states where it remains a serious problem. Unsurprisingly, Mexico's disappearances are concentrated in the regions most affected by violence and organized crime. Many of the disappeared are simply victims , innocent or otherwise, of the violence which has riven the country since Calderon declared war on criminal organizations upon taking office in 2006. States such as Quintana Roo, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas are based along key drug trafficking routes and are hotly contested by warring gangs. Quintana Roo, on the Yucatan Peninsula, registered the greatest proportion of disappearances (74.2 per 100,000 people), having in recent years witnessed a brutal conflict between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. What is striking about the pattern of disappearances is the differentiation based on gender. As Univision points out, men are more likely to go missing from densely-populated urban centers, while women often disappear from rural areas. While missing men are almost always simply undiscovered murder victims, disappeared women are often the victims of human trafficking. A Mexican congresswoman last year suggested that up to 800,000 adults are trafficked in Mexico annually for sexual exploitation, the majority being women. While many are migrants, often from Asia or Central America, rural Mexican women are often targeted because the poverty which persists in the countryside can make them more susceptible to the promise of a better life , or make relatives more willing to give them up for money. What is missing from the Univision study is a breakdown based on age, which would be useful to highlight any geographical patterns related to child trafficking. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Buenos Aires Hospital Treats 1 Drug Mule a Week. According to figures from the Buenos Aires Ministry of Health, the hospital closest to the city's international airport treats an average of one drug mule a week, an indication of the increased amount of cocaine shipped through Argentina. Between 2012 and the first five months of 2013, Hospital Ezeiza has treated 80 patients who were caught carrying capsules loaded with cocaine in their digestive systems, Clarin reports. The patients eventually expelled approximately 640 kilos of cocaine. The hospital has a special unit dedicated to receiving the patients, the majority of whom are men carrying an average of 80 grams of cocaine within their bodies. More than 60 percent of the patients are nationals from countries in the Americas, primarily Peru. Many other of the hospitalized drug mules are South African. Approximately two percent of the patients treated in hospital died from ingesting the cocaine capsules. According to the director of the hospital unit that specializes in treating the drug mules, traffickers have recently shifted their tactics in an attempt to make it more difficult for airport security to detect smugglers. Starting in 2011, the hospital began receiving patients who had ingested capsules of liquid cocaine, which is more difficult to detect by radiography. Currently, around 40 percent of the patients treated in Ezeiza have ingested liquid cocaine. The number of patients hospitalized in Ezeiza is one illustration of the amount of cocaine being trafficked from Argentina. The country has the second largest domestic market in the region for cocaine, just after Brazil, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. It is also an important transit country for cocaine shipments headed to Europe, as indicated by prominent cases such as the Julia brothers , arrested and sentenced in Spain for chartering a jet loaded with 945 kilos of the drug. The numbers from the Buenos Aires health ministry are also indicative of the desperation that may drive some people to agree to become drug mules, especially the three percent of the patients treated by the hospital between 2012 and 2013 who were pregnant.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"How Much Is Guatemala Arming the Zetas?Guatemala admits that its military has trained and even armed violent Mexican drug gangs like the Zetas. But just how far are Guatemala's criminal networks, born of Cold War death squads and spy units, responsible for supplying the Mexicans with weapons? Speaking at a drug enforcement conference in Cancun, Guatemala's Vice Minister of Security Mario Castanada admitted to three known cases of drug traffickers stealing weapons from military arsenals. According to a report by newswire EFE , Castanada did not specify when or where these robberies took place. Presumably among the cases he was referring to was one documented in March 2009 , when authorities found weapons at a Zetas training camp in the northern Quiche department. The stash was later traced to a military warehouse in the capital. When the police raided another alleged Zetas warehouse outside the capital in April 2009, they found more weapons from the same source. These included nearly 600 grenades, eleven machine guns and 5,000 rounds of ammunition, stored in boxes labeled ""Guatemalan Military Industry."" Police also found landmines and military uniforms during the raid. The Zetas are thought to have obtained these weapons from the Mariscal Zavala military base, in sales (or theft) that took place between July 2007 and January 2008. On August 20, 2009, the Zetas reportedly stole another arms shipment, including rocket and grenade launchers, that were apparently traveling overland in Guatemala, reports La Jornada. Guatemala's weapons black market is mostly controlled by shadowy criminal organizations evolved from the Cold War-era security forces. These include active and retired military and government officials, who worked together in counter-insurgency, intelligence, special forces, and the death squads. Sometimes compared to a clandestine security apparatus or a parallel state, these operatives are described as the "" hidden forces "" running the country's criminal networks: extortion, kidnapping, money laundering, smuggling migrants, drug trafficking, and the illicit arms trade. The political and military ties of the Illegal Corps and Clandestine Security Apparatus (Cuerpos Ilegales y Aparatos Clandestinos de Seguridad - CIACS), as the group is known, differentiates the organization from traditional smugglers like Juan Chamale or the Lorenzanas , as well as street gangs MS-13 and Barrio 18. The connections between the CIACS and Mexican gangs like the Zetas are well known. Rogue members of the Kaibiles, or Guatemalan Special Forces, can earn up to $5,000 a month training the Zetas in combat, the Guatemalan security minister said this week in Cancun. The question of how far Guatemalan arsenals are arming Mexican groups may have indirect implications for U.S. policy regarding gun trafficking to Mexico. When the U.S. Government Accountability Office reported in June 2009 that over 90 percent of the arms seized in Mexico (and that authorities were able to trace) were traced to the United States, debate flared on both sides of the border. Mexico pointed to U.S. complicity in the so-called ""drugs war,"" with gun stores in border states arming gangs like the Zetas, as documented in InSight's GunRunners project. The argument that Mexican groups are instead obtaining Guatemalan weapons could prove attractive for U.S. political interests seeking to justify lax gun laws. But identifying the greater source of arms for Mexican cartels -- Guatemala or the U.S. -- means relying on estimates and statistics that still seem fuzzy. As reported by the AFP , one top U.S. military official recently suggested that Mexican groups are arming themselves mostly from Central American arsenals. During testimony before the U.S. Senate on March 30, General Douglas Fraser, head of the U.S. Southern Command, said, ""Over 50 percent of the military-type weapons that are flowing throughout the region have a large source between Central American stockpiles, if you will, left over from wars and conflicts in the past."" This seems to echo statements reportedly made in a U.S. Diplomatic cable which Mexican news daily La Jornada said it exclusively obtained from whistleblower site WikiLeaks. According to the newspaper, the cable, reference ID 09Mexico808, was drafted as a briefing for ATF agents following an arms trafficking conference on April 1-2, 2009. The cable says that 90 percent of high-power weapons submitted by Mexico law enforcement to the U.S. for tracing were in fact linked to Central American arsenals, the newspaper reports. La Jornada has not yet made this cable available. Mexican groups have doubtlessly obtained AK-47s and grenades from Cold War arsenals in Guatemala, and even El Salvador. But breaking down the origins of Mexico's arms supply, in order to assign political responsibility for the gun trafficking problem, will likely prove fruitless. What is clear is that the U.S. has a set of laws that are indirectly feeding weapons into the hands of Mexican gangs, while in Guatemala the problem is more akin to a lack of proper law enforcement. Addressing the weapons trade means confronting impunity within Guatemala's police and army. But that country's Congress and executive branch have often proved powerless to take on the shadowy forces still controlling the region's illicit arms networks. One indication: the Arms and Munitions Law, which took ten years to draft and which was finally implemented in 2009, reduced the number of guns a person could carry from twelve to three. ""The law seems to have been designed to aid the dirty business of arms trafficking,"" observed a member of Congress in a December 2010, as quoted in a report by the Woodrow Wilson Center. It is clear that both Guatemala and the U.S. are prime sources of weapons for Mexican gangs. Measuring how much seems less important than addressing the laws in both countries that aid the ""dirty business."" "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Ex-Governor Bribed by Jalisco Cartel Tests Mexicos Anti-Corruption Resolve. New US sanctions against a former Mexican state governor and a top magistrate for links to the Jalisco Cartel has showcased ongoing links between the upper echelons of politics and organized crime, as well as Mexico's continued inability to bring corrupt officials to justice. On May 17, the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued sanctions against Roberto Sandoval Castaneda, the former state governor of Nayarit, and Isidro Avelar Gutierrez, a senior magistrate. The two men allegedly received bribes from the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion - CJNG) in exchange for issuing favorable judicial rulings and misappropriating state assets. ""Officials such as Isidro Avelar Gutierrez and Roberto Sandoval Castaneda callously enrich themselves at the expense of their fellow citizens,"" said Sigal Mandelker, the US Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. The two men, along with a number of Sandoval's relatives, among others, have been accused of conspiring with CJNG member Gonzalo Mendoza Gaytan, alias ""El Sapo,"" who is believed to control the cartel's activities in the busy tourist city of Puerto Vallarta just across the border in neighboring Jalisco state. Sandoval is also accused of having links to other top Mexican criminal groups, such as the Beltran Leyva Organization. He left his position as governor in disgrace in September 2017 amid a swirl of corruption allegations. He has categorically denied these latest claims, stating on social media that he had been informed of the move by OFAC and ""placed himself at the disposal of the relevant authorities for any information they may require."" Mexican authorities have moved swiftly to act on these charges. On May 20, the Attorney General of Nayarit seized 11 properties belonging to Sandoval, mostly in the capital Tepic, of which he used to be mayor. This is the 10th instance OFAC has issued sanctions related to the CJNG and officials having collaborated with the group. From 2015 to 2018, the Treasury Department tracked an intricate series of assets bought by the CJNG's financial arm, Los Cuinis, to launder drug trafficking profits. Source: US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control The charges against Sandoval were predictable. His own former attorney general, Edgar Veytia, pled guilty to drug trafficking charges in New York in January. The Sandoval administration has also been accused of systematically dismantling Nayarit's judicial and forensic capabilities, allowing crime to thrive and ignoring mass graves. But past instances of Mexican individuals being targeted by OFAC have not always led to charges in their home country. Most famously, top Mexican footballing star Rafael Marquez was accused of involvement with drug trafficking in 2017 and faced no repercussions in Mexico. This time may be different. Beyond the seizure of the former governor's properties, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has jumped on this opportunity to state that he will go after all ""narco-judges."" His government has reportedly opened new investigations into other judges who may have also received bribes. This speed in following up on US charges may be a positive trend. Previous governments have had a preoccupation with bringing down top drug kingpins rather than running down criminal connections within their ranks. And even when corrupt state governors and their entourage have been jailed, they have often been released suspiciously early into their prison sentences. With the CJNG now being one of Mexico's largest and most dangerous criminal groups with sway across the country, its ability to corrupt state officials at all levels is unlikely to be weakened.

"Striking Bahia Military Police Suspected of Exterminations. A high-ranking police official in Brazil has said that 25 to 30 of the murders that took place in the city of Salvador during a military police strike may have been committed by striking officers. O Globo reports that Arthur Gallas, director of the Bahia Homicide Department, said that some 45 of the 187 murders that took place during the strike had characteristics of ""executions,"" with the victims handcuffed or bound and shot in the head. The announcement follows the end of the police's strike in Bahia and of a separate strike in Rio , both over demands for higher wages. If some of the execution-style murders that took place during Bahia's police strike were committed by police, this would point to police involvement in paramilitary forces known as militias. This phenomenon is well-established in Rio de Janeiro, where militia groups made up of current and former security officials control entire neighborhoods. According to the Tribuna da Bahia , Salvador's police deny reports of militia activity. Brazilian federal authorities launched an investigation into broadening networks of militias, including in Bahia, last year. Between reports of extortion by police-staffed militias and hints that police may be behind some of Bahia's murders, it may take more than a $350 a month pay raise to tackle Salvador's crime problem. A recent study showed a 370 percent increase in homicide in the city from 2000 to 2010. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
New Peru Human Smuggling Groups Points to New Migration Patterns. Authorities in Peru have identified seven human trafficking groups responsible for smuggling undocumented migrants through the country and into Brazil, highlighting how the emergence of new migration patterns leads to the development of new criminal networks. Peru's national police have revealed that there are three criminal groups dedicated to smuggling illegal migrants into the country from Ecuador and another four operating in the Madre de Dios region on the border with Brazil, reported El Comercio. Most of the illegal migrants moving through the country come from Haiti and travel to the Dominican Republic by land before flying into Ecuador, which does not require Haitians to obtain a visa. From there, migrants hire smugglers to take them across the border into Peru. Although smugglers often promise to transport migrants all the way to Brazil, many are abandoned along the way. Between January 1 and June 18 this year, police detained 580 Haitian migrants in Peru, although according to official figures this number only represents ten percent of the Haitians who illegally entered the country during the same period, reported El Comercio. In total, Peruvian officials believe more than 12,000 Haitians have traveled through Peru to the Madre de Dios region since May 2011. In addition to Haitians, substantial numbers of Senegalese and Nepalese migrants are also traveling across Peru on the way to Brazil. Haiti's 2010 earthquake destroyed the country's infrastructure and propelled thousands to seek better opportunities abroad, with over 15,000 migrating to other parts of Latin America between 2010 and 2012 alone, by some estimates. Attracted by the country's growing economic power, undocumented immigrants from countries such as Haiti have poured into Brazil, with over 5,000 entering the Amazon state of Acre -- via Bolivia and Peru -- in a period of just a few weeks in April 2013. Police investigations in Peru illustrate the criminal networks that have sprung up around migration routes through the country, charging between $100 and $200 a person to smuggle migrants across the border from Ecuador. The migration route to Brazil also reflects the effects of economic changes on regional migration patterns, which were previously dominated by travel northward to the United States. According to the US Department of Homeland Security, the number of undocumented immigrants entering the United States decreased significantly between 2005 and 2010, likely partly because of the country's economic recession. Immigrants now appear to be turning towards other new economic powerhouses like Brazil, and human smuggling rings are springing up to meet the demand.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Colombias ELN Guerrillas Bought Kidnap Victims. Authorities in Colombia busted a kidnapping network that reportedly sold victims to rebel army the ELN, a possible indication the guerrilla group is distancing itself from this criminal activity in anticipation that formal peace talks may soon begin. On February 22, Colombia's Attorney General's Office announced that 12 members of a suspected kidnapping ring were captured, accused of selling their victims to Marxist rebel group the National Liberation Army (ELN), reported AFP. Demobilized guerrilla fighers and a local government official in Choco department were among those captured, reported El Colombiano. The Attorney General's Office said this kidnapping ring sold at least five victims to the ELN. According to authorities, the kidnapping ring was likely behind the 2013 abduction of the former governor of Choco, who was later handed over to an ELN front active in this department. The ELN paid $122,000 per kidnapping victim, according to El Colombiano. The dismantling of this kidnapping ring suggests the ELN may be looking for a few degrees of separation when it comes to kidnapping, typically one of its principal sources or revenue. The ELN has extensive experience carrying out kidnapping operations, and it is worth questioning why they felt the need to contract out the activity to other criminal groups. A more likely scenario is that the ELN is looking for a way to hold on to some of the profits from kidnapping, without directly carrying out the crime themselves. The ELN began preliminary peace talks with the government in June 2014, and the group's leadership has recently indicated it is open to the possibility of taking steps to begin formal negotiations. However, giving up kidnapping would likely be a government precondition to sitting down with the ELN, meaning the guerrilla group could already be looking to delegate some of these operations to third parties. The ELN is also probably planning for future peace talks by focusing on other criminal revenue streams such as extortion and drug trafficking. There is evidence a similar dynamic is playing out with the ELN's guerrilla counterpart, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The FARC earn huge profits off the illicit drug trade, but in January 2014 the rebel army reportedly promised to cut ties to drug trafficking in order to facilitate a peace agreement. To maintain revenue from drug trafficking in a more inconspicuous manner, the FARC is reportedly allying themselves with local criminal groups in areas where the guerrilla group is heavily involved in the drug trade, such as Putumayo.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Spain, Portugal Break Up Argentine Cocaine Trafficking Ring. Authorities dismantled a smugglers' ring that trafficked hundreds of kilos of cocaine from Argentina to Europe, pointing to the continent's increased importance as a consumer market. As part of ""Operation Patagonia,"" a joint initiative between Spanish and Portuguese authorities, police seized 393 kilos of cocaine in late February. The cocaine is estimated to have a market value of over $18 million. Seven Argentines were arrested, five of them in Lisbon, another in the Canary Islands, while the group's supposed leader was detained in Barcelona, reports Clarin. According to officials, the drug was smuggled in bags of charcoal (pictured above) between the ports of Buenos Aires and Lisbon. Experts told Clarin that the use of charcoal is ideal for traffickers moving cocaine as both are organic materials, making it much harder for authorities to scan and find anything suspect. Police became aware of the group's smuggling operation last December, after the traffickers apparently left behind a 14 kilo bag of cocaine in a shipping container. The ensuing investigation led to the identification and arrest of the Argentine suspects, as well as the seizure of the cocaine shipment in Lisbon some weeks ago. No information has been released about the identities of the detainees, though Spanish police said the group's alleged leader has a criminal history in Argentina and is ""well known"" there. Argentina has long been a key transit route for cocaine headed for Europe, while Spain acts as the continent's primary gateway for drug trafficking organizations. According to the US State Department's 2012 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report , Argentine officials believe that the country is an increasingly important transit country for cocaine, due to the aggressive counter-narcotics efforts in Colombia and Mexico forcing traffickers to look at alternate routes, combined with weak interdiction efforts in neighboring Bolivia (the world's third highest producer of cocaine). So far, however, it is unclear whether the Argentine nationals detained in Europe have any direct ties to the larger Colombian and Mexican transnational criminal organizations (TCOs). While such a link would not be surprising given the organizational capacity required to ship hundreds of kilos of narcotics, if the smugglers were acting alone, it could suggest that independent traffickers from Argentina are increasingly keen to exploit Europe's growing cocaine market.

"Plan Colombia is not a Cure-All for Latin Americas Woes. A prominent academic and US military official is the most recent voice to call for a ""Plan Colombia"" in Central America, a tenuous proposition that relies on oversimplified analogies and a questionable understanding of current conditions in the region. Writing for Foreign Policy magazine , James Stavridis -- a retired four-star US Navy admiral and the current Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University -- argues that the United States should implement a ""Plan Central America"" based on lessons learned from ""Plan Colombia."" Stavridis -- citing rising violence rates and drug trafficking activity in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, a region known as the Northern Triangle -- says the United States must partner with these nations and apply ""some of the many valuable lessons learned in Colombia."" This includes ""a mix of outside assistance, local determination, and key tools"" to help address the Northern Triangle's challenges. He goes on to outline three ways in which a Plan Central America should resemble Plan Colombia. The first is to ""create security in very fundamental ways at ground level with trainers and advisors."" This, Stavridis says, should take the same approach as in Colombia, and ought to consist of ""specialized and well-trained military personnel"" as opposed to large troop deployments. Stavridis goes on say the United States should send more lawyers to these countries to help implement legal mechanisms for confronting transnational crime (such as extradition to the United States). Second, US aid should be ""interagency-focused and a meld of defense, diplomacy and development."" However, while Stavridis approves of the $1.1 billion grant under the recent US Strategy for Engagement in Central America, he believes more funding is needed -- along the lines of $2 billion annually. Stavridis has some experience in Latin America. Nonetheless, this makes his simplified and underdeveloped recommendations for US policy in Central all the more disquieting Stavridis's third recommendation is to consistently fund maritime interdiction operations. Citing comments that the Coast Guard is only capable of interdicting less than 20 percent of all drug flows, Stavridis argues: ""If we continue to starve the [US] Coast Guard and Navy in this region, we leave it open for huge profits for narcotic smugglers -- further increasing the money available to destabilize the region."" Overall, Stavridis says he is not calling for a new ""War on Drugs"" -- which he labels a failed construct -- but rather a "" smart power "" approach: a combination of diplomacy, and economic, financial, security, and development aid. This is something he says the United States has done effectively before in Colombia, and can do now in Central America. During his career, Admiral Stavridis served from 2006 to 2009 as the head of US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) -- the US Combatant Command responsible for Central and South America. As such, Stavridis has some experience in Latin America. Nonetheless, this makes his simplified and underdeveloped recommendations for US policy in Central America all the more disquieting. Most notably, Stavridis neglects to mention several key differences between Colombia's situation in the late 1990s and the Northern Triangle countries of Central America today -- differences which raise serious concerns over the wisdom of using Plan Colombia as a model for the region. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Plan Colombia In Colombia, the counter-insurgency campaign waged against the FARC and ELN lent itself to a massive, US-supported military buildup under Plan Colombia. Colombian defense spending tripled from $4 to $12 billion, and between 2000 and 2008 the armed forces increased from 145,000 to 236,000 members. Given the FARC and ELN largely operated in the sparsely populated rural periphery of the country, the task of distinguishing between combatant and non-combatant was made easier; presenting a relatively distinguishable enemy to be targeted by military forces. SEE ALSO : Colombia News and Profiles The source and territorial nature of violence and insecurity in the Northern Triangle, however, is a contrast to Colombia; the most obvious difference being the lack of an active insurgency and network of paramilitary groups. And compared to Colombia, the grassroots drug trafficking structures in Central America function primarily as transporters, with the region mainly used for the transit of drugs and laundering money. For the three Northern Triangle countries, calling for a ""Plan Central America"" may actually be doing those countries a disservice by setting false expectations and emphasizing inappropriate methods and outcomes. The primary security threat in the Northern Triangle is urban-based localized crime (i.e., kidnapping, extortion, assault) fueled by street gangs like MS-13 and Barrio-18. It is therefore unclear what ""specialized and well trained military personnel"" -- who Stavridis recommends should be part of a ""Plan Central America"" -- would do exactly (In this suggestion, Stavridis also appears to contradict himself, as he implies the militarization of police forces should be avoided). To be sure, while certain military capacities (like intelligence collection) are necessary to dismantle transnational drug trafficking organizations operating in the region, military advisors can only do so much to tackle local criminal groups -- the main drivers of citizen insecurity and violence in the region. Instead, the challenge of locally based gangs in Central America calls for stronger police work and building up the ability of the police to investigate crime , as well as a functioning penal and judicial system. On the last point, while Stavridis' recommendation of sending more lawyers may help build up expertise, this alone will not serve to rehaul the broken, corrupt judicial systems in which these lawyers operate. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Judicial Reform Nor is it clear how bolstering maritime interdiction in the Caribbean will translate into tangible security gains for the average person in Central America. A major reason drugs began transiting through Central America in the first place was because Caribbean smuggling routes into south Florida were hit hard by US interdiction efforts in the 1980s and 1990s, pushing drugs routes elsewhere in a prime example of the ""balloon effect."" Indeed, there is no reason to think increased naval patrols would ultimately reduce the incentives (i.e., massive profits) to traffic drugs. Paradoxically, doing so may only serve to encourage traffickers to smuggle drugs overland, increasing insecurity and further destabilizing those communities located along drug routes. Another condition that allowed Plan Colombia to work was the Colombian government's ability to finance increased military expenditures and absorb large amounts of US aid. Recognizing the need for drastic action in the face of surmounting security threats, Colombia wholeheartedly committed to Plan Colombia, ultimately investing nearly eight times as much as the United States. Colombia's relatively strong economy and GDP not only allowed the country to triple its defense budget, but also to absorb US aid and training by independently sustaining and funding programs once the United States scaled back. Also crucial to Plan Colombia's success was the willingness of Colombia's wealthy elite to pay an additional tax to help fund certain programs. Invoking the language and imagery of Plan Colombia when discussing aid for Latin American countries is a dangerous and vast oversimplification of the complexities across the region. The presidents of the Northern Triangle countries have indeed demonstrated a degree of political will and ""local determination"" in order to secure a Central American version of Plan Colombia. Yet the fact remains these countries have extremely weak institutions, making it extremely doubtful they could absorb the $2 billion in annual US aid Stavridis recommends. It is more likely this amount of money would saturate local agencies -- which lack capacity to handle and direct large funds -- as well as create vast opportunities for graft and corruption. Furthermore, given anemic tax collection rates, the Northern Triangle countries would be hard pressed to maintain and sustain programs (let alone match initial US investment as in Colombia) once the United States reduced funding (For example, Guatemala has an estimated tax burden rate of 10.9 percent of GDP, one of the lowest in Latin America). Yet despite Colombia's unique set of conditions, policymakers in both the United States and Latin America have consistently used Plan Colombia as a model for success in the region. Its use as an analogy, however, is often based primarily on superficial similarities. Indeed, invoking the language and imagery of Plan Colombia when discussing aid for Latin American countries is a dangerous and vast oversimplification of the complexities across the region. For the three Northern Triangle countries, calling for a ""Plan Central America"" may actually be doing those countries a disservice by setting false expectations and emphasizing inappropriate methods and outcomes. Ultimately, while it is right to appeal for increased US attention to a region plagued by violence and crime, Central America is not Colombia. Policymakers must therefore be cautious about using Plan Colombia as a roadmap for action in the region, and should avoid indiscriminately taking its lessons as gospel."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Venezuela Tries Low Level Military Drug Traffickers. Seven current and former Venezuela military officials are to be tried for allowing illegal drug flights to transit through the country, in a small-scale prosecution that continues to leave the highest ranks of corrupt military untouched. A court in the state of Aragua has confirmed charges against five Venezuelan Military Air Force officials -- a major, a captain and two lieutenants -- and two retired National Guard officials, according to a Public Ministry press release. These individuals are suspected of allowing the entrance and exit of non-authorized aircraft through Venezuelan air space, and will be tried for drug trafficking, conspiracy and the formation of armed groups. Among the accused is the Air Force Coronel Rafael Ponce Delgado, who was formerly in charge of control tower communications in Las Flecheras airport, in the state of Apure, which borders Colombia. The current and former military officials are being detained. Three Colombian nationals and one Venezuelan have been sentenced to five years in prison as part of the same case. The Public Ministry added that a high ranking military official allegedly offered a substantial amount of dollars per month -- though it is unclear to whom -- in return for allowing the passage of illegal flights. Investigations began in May 2015 after allegations were presented to the General Directorate of Military Counterintelligence (Direccion General de Contrainteligencia Militar - DGCIM). While this investigation into military involvement in criminal activities by a Venezuelan court is encouraging, its focus on low-ranking officials is of little impact, and avoids targeting the military elite believed to be behind the country's drug trafficking operations. Although such prosecutions aim to take out the lower rungs of the corrupt military, it is largely believed that involvement in drug trafficking reaches the very top military posts -- referred to as the ""Cartel of the Suns"" (Cartel de los Soles) -- as well as leading politicians (the current Vice-president and former National Assembly leader Diosdado Cabello has been on the receiving end of numerous allegations in recent months). This new trial brings to mind the unsatisfactory judicial backlash that followed the historic bust of 1.3 tons of cocaine on a commercial flight from Caracas to Paris in 2013. A number of National Guard members -- including two sergeants and a first lieutenant -- were subsequently detained, although it was suggested that these arrests were merely a facade , while the true brains behind the operation remained free. The impunity of high-level figures continues despite increasing pressure by the United States' to expose the involvement of elements of the Venezuelan government in illegal trafficking activities. In December 2015, the US Department of Justice announced that it would bring charges against numerous top Venezuelan government officials, naming only the head of the National Guard and former Drug Czar Nestor Reverol, and the former top antidrug official Edilberto Molina. Furthermore, November 2015 saw the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) arrest the Venezuelan first lady's nephews in Haiti, and the pair are currently being tried by a New York court on cocaine smuggling charges. The reaction of Venezuela's socialist government has generally been denial, and First Lady Cilia Flores most recently spoke up on the case, claiming that the DEA had ""kidnapped"" her nephews. The military represents a key power base for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's crumbling socialist government, so it is unsurprising that the executive choose to turn a blind eye to serious criminal allegations to avoid compromising the army's support for the regime."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Oil Thieves Convenient Scapegoats for Mexicos Gasoline Shortages. A crackdown on oil theft has seen the president of Mexico stop major fuel pipelines, causing severe fuel shortages in parts of the country, but are oil thieves solely to blame for the current crisis? President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announced on December 27, 2018, plans to combat rampant fuel theft from installations run by Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the country's state-owned oil company. Shortly after, soldiers set out to protect strategic oil facilities throughout the country, including shutting down a major oil pipeline at the Salamanca refinery in the central state of Guanajuato. The closing of the Salamanca pipeline, which has been crippled by fuel thieves over the years, caused major fuel shortages in central Mexico. Instead of using the pipelines, the government began using trucks and train cars protected by soldiers and police to transport fuel, according to the Washington Post. However, this method has been slow and unreliable. Despite the shortages, Lopez Obrador is asking citizens not to panic and to support the crackdown. ""There is enough gasoline in the country but we cannot use the pipelines because there are networks that were created to steal gasoline,"" he said at a January 9 press conference. Oil thieves stole more than 2.2 billion liters (around 600 million gallons) of fuel from Pemex refineries in 2016, representing at least $1.5 billion in losses for the company. In 2017, incidents of oil theft recorded by Pemex reached record highs , jumping to 9,509 and shattering the 6,873 incidents recorded in 2016. A recent Rolling Stone report stated that the country's oil and gas reserves ""represent a potential source of wealth far greater than illegal narcotics could ever yield."" Some experts have supported Lopez Obrador's decision to confront the oil theft industry that largely went unchecked in previous years. ""We have a network of pipelines that are vulnerable to organized crime and by the corruption in the government. Previous administrations tolerated this for years,"" Ruben Salazar, the director of Etellekt Consultants, told the Washington Post. Others have criticized the plan's logistics and the way the president has communicated his strategy. ""If military intervention is the strategy, we do not have enough sailors, soldiers or policemen to defend or monitor the nearly 9,000 kilometers we have of pipelines 24 hours a day. It will not be long before organized crime begins to intervene,"" analyst Gonzalo Monroy told CNN. Mexico's oil theft industry is booming and has been a staple of organized crime in the country for years. But the criminal makeup of oil thieves, known locally as ""huachicoleros,"" has developed from small-time groups into more organized structures controlled by the country's infamous cartels. But while Lopez Obrador has so far blamed his crackdown and the ensuing fuel shortages in large part on oil thieves, the situation is far more complex. Oil theft would not be possible without the complicity of engineers and workers at Pemex's refineries. Questions have also been raised as to whether the economic losses and discontent caused by the pipeline shutdown have outweighed the damages created by the oil thieves. Layers of corruption within Pemex, including employees sharing maps of the pipelines and information on how best to pierce through them, help facilitate the illicit industry. Indeed, Lopez Obrador recently announced that the former head of security at Pemex, Eduardo Leon Trauwitz, is being investigated for his alleged role in helping facilitate oil theft, according to El Universal. One source told Milenio in a 2017 interview that Pemex officials notify thieves of the exact time that oil will be passing through pipelines, in addition to providing them with the equipment needed to extract the oil safely. But the corruption extends beyond just Pemex's workers. ""[Corruption] involves public prosecutors, municipal authorities, state secretaries, and goes as far up as you can imagine,"" the source said. To make matters worse, Pemex is facing serious fuel production issues. Lopez Obrador himself admitted at a January 10 press conference that there are several Pemex refineries that have been shut down for a while or that are producing very little oil. After an uptick in the number of barrels produced per day to start 2018, production started to fall in April, dropping from 375,000 barrels per day to just 188,000 barrels by the end of 2018, according to statistics from Mexico's Energy Secretariat. In the middle of 2018, Pemex's six main oil refineries were operating at just 40 percent of their capacity and producing the lowest amount of oil seen in the last 25 years, according to El Economista. Pemex has also reduced its imports of gasoline from the United States since Lopez Obrador took office a little more than a month ago, according to the Wall Street Journal , further compounding the current crisis."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"After Scandal, El Salvador Police Trade One Elite Unit for Another. Two months after a scandal over the abduction of a police officer by members of her own elite unit, El Salvador's national police announced the unit's replacement with another specialized force with the same objectives and features very similar to those of its controversial predecessor. Police Chief Howard Cotto announced the ""dissolution"" of the Police Reaction Group (Grupo de Reaccion Policial - GRP) and its replacement by the Specialized Police Tactical Unit (Unidad Tactica Especializada Policial - UTEP), also known as the Jaguars. The elite unit will be under the command of the deputy commissioner, Cesar Ortega, known in his circle as ""Artillero"" or ""Gunner."" Half an hour after the announcement, the UTEP launched its first operation , which included several arrests and seizures allegedly linked to the financial structure of the MS13. One of the suspects arrested is accused of laundering money for the gang through a minibus company. The GRP has been repeatedly linked to massacres, and more recently the unit was shaken by the disappearance of officer Carla Ayala from their facilities, allegedly at the hands of one of her colleagues, at the end of December last year. Cotto made it clear that none of the more than 200 men and 16 women from the GRP will be part of the UTEP. However, it will take on members from the Special Reaction Forces (Fuerza Especializada de Reaccion - FES) and the Special Police Operations Unit (Grupo de Operaciones Policiales Especiales - GOPES). Last August an investigation by Revista Factum revealed that members of the FES had participated in at least three extrajudicial executions, as well as cases of sexual abuse and extortion. Although the police have indicated that they are currently conducting an internal investigation into what happened regarding officer Ayala, the Attorney General's Office has stated that the outcome is still uncertain and the case has come to be largely dependent on witness testimony due in part to obstacles put in place by the very same police force on which she served. Previous investigations within the police ranks have often proven to be fruitless, with few convictions to date. The impunity surrounding cases involving security forces can be attributed to several structural factors that, in addition to the culture of violence within its ranks, can be tied to institutional capabilities and political will. Agnes Callamard, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, recently told InSight Crime that systemic changes are necessary to address impunity for abuses of authority by police. ""Ultimately it is about providing good evidence, having judges that are not afraid of indicting police officers, protecting these judges from very unpopular decisions and ensuring that internally within those institutions there are mechanisms that allow the gathering of the required evidence to demonstrate extrajudicial executions or excessive use of force,"" Callamard said. In this context, the decision to replace an entire police elite unit with another in the midst of continuous accusations of abuse and violence seems to be more of a cosmetic measure than a concerted effort to address the institution's impunity issues."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Appoints Prosecutor for Urabenos Surrender. Colombia's Attorney General's office has appointed a special prosecutor to lead exploratory talks over the proposed demobilization of Urabenos, the clearest sign yet that the government is seriously considering a negotiated exit for the country's biggest criminal group. Colombia's vice attorney general, Jorge Fernando Perdomo, has announced the appointment of a special prosecutor who will meet with representatives of the Urabenos and discuss conditions for a possible surrender, reported El Espectador. Perdomo said there had already been meetings with lawyers representing the Urabenos, who have informed the authorities they are prepared to turn themselves in and demobilize their men. Any deal would involve the Urabenos handing over their arms and assets, and providing information that would allow the authorities to dismantle their criminal, political and economic networks, the prosecutor added. The Urabenos would also have to commit to end the recruitment of minors. One of Colombia's most prominent politicians -- leader of the Alternative Democratic Pole political party and Bogota mayoral candidate Clara Lopez -- has rejected the opportunity to act as a mediator between the two sides, according to El Espectador. This appointment confirms that the Colombian government sees negotiations as a genuine option -- and it is an option that could become even more attractive if the mass manhunt for the group's leader, Dario Usuga, alias ""Otoniel,"" drags on without success. Critically, there is no indication that the authorities intend to bestow political status on the Urabenos. This is something the group's leaders themselves have called for , but doing so would seriously complicate Colombia's conflict. Instead, the proposed deals look more akin to the bargains cut with the US authorities, in which criminals turn themselves in and provide information in return for benefits such as reduced prison sentences. SEE ALSO : The Victory of the Urabenos - the New Face of Colombian Organized CrimeUrabenos However, two of the ideas reportedly proposed by the Urabenos are particularly striking -- and both recall recall Colombia's first and most disastrous negotiation with a major drug lord: Pablo Escobar. One proposal is that the Urabenos leaders would be incarcerated in a special site. Escobar built his own, custom-made luxury prison from where he continued to run his criminal empire and from where he was able to escape with ease when the authorities closed in. Given this history, such a move in the Urabenos case would prove highly polemical. The second is the guarantee that the Urabenos leaders would not be extradited to the United States. Once, the prospect of extradition was enough for Escobar to launch a war against the state. However, the Urabenos proposal could prove less controversial in Colombia's current environment. These days, extradition is often a preferred option for drug lords looking to cut deals in the US, making it ever more controversial in Colombia. It is possible that authorities would now welcome the opportunity to put the Urabenos top command on trial in Colombia, using it as an opportunity to show they can now resolve such cases outside of the US."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Two US Agents Attacked: One Dead, Many Questions. InSight has learned that the unidentified gunmen, responsible for killing one and wounding another U.S. agent in northern Mexico on Tuesday, may not have known the identities of their victims. According to sources consulted by InSight, the agents were detained while traveling on Highway 57, which connects San Luis Potosi to Mexico City. It is unclear whether the pair were stopped at a roadblock or forced off the road. The agents then rolled down the car window, reinforcing the theory that the assailants may have been wearing military garb, perhaps confusing the agents or causing them to believe this was a military roadblock. A perpetrator then stuck an AK-47 in the window, shooting one agent in the leg and another in the chest. The two agents worked for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. The agent shot in the chest, identified as Jaime Zapata, died from his injuries. The second agent, who remains unidentified, is hospitalized and in stable condition. The shooting raises the question of whether the killings represent random acts of violence or a more sophisticated targeting of U.S personnel. This latest attack comes just under a year after the killing of Lesley Enriquez, who worked at the U.S Consulate in Juarez, and her husband. Both were shot and killed in their car in Juarez in March 2010. The murders remain unsolved. In 2008, members of the Gulf Cartel attacked the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey, firing shots and launching a defective grenade at the building. But the most famous attack involving Mexican gunmen against U.S. personnel was the murder of Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena. The subsequent crackdown, aided substantially by a bulked-up DEA investigative unit, led to the eventual dismantling of the Guadalajara Cartel. The main question raised by this most recent attack on U.S. personnel is whether this indicates powerful drug cartels have moved beyond random acts of violence and have adopted a strategy of targeting American agents. InSight however is not yet prepared to draw such conclusions. Many basic facts still remain unclear but so far it appears this was an attack by chance, committed by assailants who were most likely wearing military uniform, possibly prompting the agents to lower their car window. Therefore it is unlikely that this action will prompt similar attention from U.S. authorities, as occurred with the targeted killing of Camarena in 1985. 	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Colombia Gangs Have 5,000 Members: Police. Almost 5,000 people are members of criminal gangs in Colombia , according to a recent police report on gang activity in the country. According to the report , it is estimated that criminal gangs in Colombia have a combined membership of 4,980 people, a figure almost 700 higher that was estimated in January, in a previous police report into gang activity. The government has labeled these gangs BACRIM , short for ""bandas criminales emergentes,"" or emerging criminal groups. Of the close to 5,000 gang members, the police report stated that around half are believed to form part of the core structure of the gangs, and are heavily armed, while the other half play support roles, performing tasks such as transporting drugs and collecting extortion money. The numbers quoted by the police report seem to run contrary to the claims of Colombian bishop Monsignor Julio Cesar Vidal Ortiz , who recently said that, to his knowledge, around 5,000 members of the BACRIM are interested in demobilizing. As InSight Crime reported earlier this year, the head of the Colombian National Police, General Oscar Naranjo, has called the BACRIMs the biggest threat to national security in the country.

"Venezuela to Use Military to Fight Crime. Venezuela will deploy the military to fight crime, a move that will likely increase concerns over the depth of corruption in the armed forces and the possibility that human rights could be compromised in the name of citizen security. Interior and Justice Minister Miguel Rodriguez announced that the army, navy, and air force would join National Guard troops in a new security initiative, reported The Associated Press. Rodriguez described the military as an ""important tool that will bring peace to citizens"" and would allow the public to ""feel safe in the streets,"" although he did not provide further details on how, exactly, the armed forces would be deployed. Activist Rafael Uzcategui, a representative from human rights non-governmental organization (NGO) PROVEA, was critical of the announcement, stating that the military is not trained in fighting crime. In late April, Minister Rodriguez said that he would soon announce a series of new measures meant to tackle insecurity in Venezuela, now one of the most dangerous countries in the world, with murders in the first four months of the year reaching an average of 58 per day. Turning to the military to help fight crime is a common phenomenon in Latin America. Under former President Felipe Calderon, Mexico made great use of its armed forces in taking down high-value criminal targets. Other countries have turned to the military in order to make up for a corrupt and under-trained police force. However, there are valid concerns that the armed forces are more inclined to use heavy-handed tactics at the expense of human rights, something clearly seen in Mexico, where the armed forces have been documented engaging in a wide range of abuses, including torture and disappearances. There is also the issue of deploying a military plagued with corruption issues as a crime-fighting force. In Venezuela, the very highest levels of military command have been accused of complicity with organized crime."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Ancient Andean Tradition or Dangerous Narcotic? A Tale of Two Documents. A diplomatic battle is raging over whether the United Nations should reverse its ban on coca leaf chewing, with the United States maintaining that such a repeal would strengthen drug-trafficking organizations and Bolivia contending that the practice is a harmless indigenous tradition. InSight Crime examines both sides of the argument, which centers around two United Nations documents: the U.N. Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. This week, Bolivian President Evo Morales launched a controversial international campaign to raise awareness of coca leaf usage, in support of his own requested amendment to the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs that would remove the leaf from its banned substances list. If no countries had objected, the amendment would pass automatically on January 31. However, the Associated Press reports that the U.S. has filed an official objection with the U.N. Secretary General, thus halting the amendment's progress. In the past, the U.S. has backed its rejection of coca leaf chewing with the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs , which calls for the uprooting of all wild coca plants and declares that ""coca leaf chewing must be abolished within twenty-five years from the coming into force of this Convention."" Recently, an anonymous State Department official told the Washington Post that removing the coca leaf from the treaty ""over the long term is not good for the planet's efforts to control and eventually solve the problem of drug abuse,"" adding that it could create legal challenges to drug crimes committed in the United States. In his letter to the Secretary General, Morales concedes that the 25-year period mentioned in the Covenant has expired, but argues that any attempt to ban coca chewing conflicts with the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. As the Declaration states, ""indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressionsThey also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions."" As such, Morales contends that use of the leaf began thousands of years ago by the country's indigenous majority to combat hunger, fatigue and altitude sickness, so therefore cannot can not be classified as an illicit substance by the U.N. On a policy level, the two arguments highlight an increasingly important contradiction between global cultural rights and drug laws, as governments around the world seek a balance between a respect for the traditional practices of minorities with the need to control illicit drug trafficking. Pragmatically, however, the conflict is an example of international realpolitik at its finest. Because Morales came to power at the head of Bolivia's largest coca-growers' union, he is often caught in an awkward balancing act, having to placate his domestic constituents' attitudes towards coca while simultaneously appearing ""tough"" on cocaine trafficking to foreign governments. By invoking the language of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and carefully distinguishing coca from cocaine, Morales is able to both appease the trade interests of coca growers and commit himself in principle to combating drug trafficking. Additionally, it allows him to capitalize on his status as the country's first fully-indigenous president, a core element of his political identity. From the U.N. Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs : Article 26 - The Coca Bush and Coca Leaves - 1. If a Party permits the cultivation of the coca bush, it shall apply thereto and to coca leaves the system of controls as provided in article 23 respecting the control of the opium poppy, but as regards paragraph 2d of that article, the requirements imposed on the Agency therein referred to shall be only to take physical possession of the crops as soon as possible after the end of the harvest. - 2. The Parties shall so far as possible enforce the uprooting of all coca bushes which grow wild. They shall destroy the coca bushes if illegally cultivated. Article 27 - Additional Provisions Relating to Coca Leaves -1. The Parties may permit the use of coca leaves for the preparation of a flavoring agent, which shall not contain any alkaloids, and, to the extent necessary for such use, may permit the production, import, export, trade in and possession of such leaves. - 2. The Parties shall furnish separately estimates (article 19) and statistical information (article 20) in respect of coca leaves for preparation of the flavoring agent, except to the extent that the same coca leaves are used for the extraction of alkaloids and the flavoring agent, and so explained in the estimates and statistical information. Article 49, Paragraph 2 (e): Coca leaf chewing must be abolished within twenty-five years from the coming into force of this Convention as provided in paragraph 1 of article 41. From the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples : Article 11 - 1. Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, protect and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, technologies and visual and performing arts and literature. -2. States shall provide redress through effective mechanisms, which may include restitution, developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples, with respect to their cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without their free, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs. Article 12 -1. Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practise, develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies; the right to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites; the right to the use and control of their ceremonial objects; and the right to the repatriation of their human remains. -2. States shall seek to enable the access and/or repatriation of ceremonial objects and human remains in their possession through fair, transparent and effective mechanisms developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples concerned. Article 31 -1. Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.

"Record Year for Colombia Marijuana Interdiction But Cocaine Seizures Dive. Marijuana seizure rates in Colombia reached their highest levels for 20 years in 2013 while cocaine seizures plummeted dramatically compared to the previous year, illustrating evolutions in Colombian drug production but also raising questions over interdiction efforts. Authorities seized 347 tons of marijuana last year, 50 tons more than in 2012. The increase fits in with a long term trend that has seen seizures rise by 350 percent since 2008 and represents the biggest annual haul since 1993, reported El Tiempo However, the official figures show authorities only seized 70 tons of cocaine in 2013, representing a drastic fall from 2012 -- although quite how much cocaine was seized in that year is difficult to say for sure: By some counts it was a record 241 tons , however Ministry of Defense figures suggested a lower total, while the US State Department an even higher total. Authorities also announced they had seized 375 kilos of heroin and 184,000 pills of synthetic drugs. The continuing rise in marijuana seizures should come as no surprise. An estimated 70 percent of Colombian marijuana ends up on the domestic market, which in recent years has become an ever more important source of revenue for both criminal and rebel groups as they diversify their criminal interests. The guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in particular have cashed in on the domestic marijuana boom, and are believed to be behind the trade in two of the country's main production centers -- the southern department of Cauca and the eastern department of Meta. The narco-paramilitary groups labeled the BACRIM (from the Spanish abbreviation for ""criminal bands"") also have a role in the trade, and control production in the traditional marijuana heartland of the northern department of Magdalena, according to police. However, the dramatic decrease in cocaine seizures is far more difficult to explain. While according to the United Nations , coca cultivation in Colombia has fallen, cocaine production has remained stable, and has certainly not decreased sufficiently to account for such a drastic drop. This leaves the possibility that drug traffickers have successfully adapted to counter interdiction efforts after losing large quantities 2012 by increasing use of sophisticated and difficult to detect trafficking techniques, such as the use of submarines , or through new methods or tactics. Whatever the reason, the decline is a stark reminder of the adaptability of drug traffickers, who inevitably respond to interdiction successes by evolving, not by abandoning their lucrative business. * This article was amended on January 1 to include contrasting statistics on 2012 cocaine seizures"	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Ecuador Criminal Gangs Show Military-Style Training: Police. Quito's police chief has warned that the Ecuadorean security forces may be involved in organized crime, noting that the professionalism of some attacks carried out in the city suggest that criminal gangs have had military-style training. The commander of Quito's Metropolitan Police, Colonel Juan Carlos Rueda, made the comments during a debate organized by El Comercio newspaper on "" Insecurity in Quito - Strategies for 2012 ."" The secretary of homeland security, Lourdes Rodriguez, said that the city faced ""serious"" security problems, but stressed that the homicide rate in Quito is below the national average. Ecuador has shown signs of becoming a new hotspot for transnational organized crime in recent years. Transnational criminal gangs from Colombia and Mexico are thought to be increasing their presence in the country, prompting a U.S. drug official to refer to country as the "" UN of organized crime "" in July. As InSight Crime has previously reported , political instability, lax visa policies, the country's proximity to Colombian drug cultivation areas and the adoption of the U.S. dollar as official currency (facilitating money laundering) have all played a part in the increasing presence of these gangs in Ecuador.

"El Salvador Confession Reveals Drug Kingpins Fruit Vendor Origins. El Salvador authorities disclosed new details about the rise of a drug boss accused of moving 10 tons of cocaine into the United States, in a case highlighting the growing role of ""free agent"" traffickers in Central America's underworld. According to a confession given by an accomplice, Jorge Ernesto Ulloa Sibrian, alias ""Repollo,"" began his career importing fruit and vegetables into El Salvador from Honduras, but soon switched to smuggling marijuana from Guatemala. La Prensa Grafica reported that in 1997 the source, named only as Horacio, accompanied Ulloa on a trip to Honduras where they were unsuccessful in their attempts to buy cocaine. They did, however, meet with several high-level traffickers, including local contacts for Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. The relationship soon bore fruit, according to the confession, as Horacio and Ulloa brought 12 kilos of cocaine back to El Salvador on two separate smuggling trips the following year. When the Sinaloa contacts in Honduras were without drugs, Ulloa apparently turned to a Nicaraguan named by La Prensa Grafica as Juan Dewel (identified in other sources as ""Dewey"") Thomas Altamirano. The newspaper reported Thomas Altamirano was linked to a 2010 case in Nicaragua of a ring transporting cocaine by helicopter , in which two of his siblings captured. Ulloa was arrested in Guatemala last year , accused of having moved more than 10 tons of cocaine to the United States between 2005 and 2012. From humble beginnings, Ulloa's operation quickly grew into a large network that stretched from Colombia to the United States, via Mexico and all of Central America. Upon his arrest in Guatemala, El Salvador's minister of Justice and Security said Ulloa had strong connections to El Salvador's Texis cartel, a key drug trafficking and criminal organization with high-level political and business connections. It was later revealed that a witness in Ulloa's trial had identified Salvadoran congressman Wilver Alexander Rivera Monge as one of the organization's key players. Ulloa allegedly received shipments of cocaine from Colombia, which his network smuggled overland into Panama, Costa Rica and then Nicaragua. From there it passed into the hands of various criminal groups, including the Alvaritos in Nicaragua and the Sinaloa contacts in Honduras, his original suppliers. Ulloa's story is indicative of how Central America's ""transportistas,"" who move drugs between South America and Mexico, have become the lynchpins of the drug trade, operating as unaffiliated free agents, smuggling drugs across borders for multiple groups and cartels. One has to remember that many Mexico's mighty cartels began life as transporters for the Colombians."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"What Does Mario Estradas Guilty Plea Mean for Guatemala?The guilty plea of Mario Estrada, a former Guatemalan presidential candidate, to conspiring to import cocaine into the United States has triggered a backlash against President Jimmy Morales, who is now facing a new investigation into his ties to Estrada. Estrada, who made an unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2006, was captured in Miami in April 2019 but pled not guilty to conspiring to import cocaine into the United States, as well as a related weapons charge and to possess and use machine guns. On October 8, after hearing the evidence against him, the Guatemalan politician changed his plea to guilty. Last January, he and an associate, Juan Pablo Gonzalez Mayorga , met with people they believed to be members of the Sinaloa Cartel but who were actually undercover Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) informants. In a series of meetings, Estrada and Gonzalez asked the alleged drug traffickers for $10-$12 million to finance another presidential run by Estrada. In return, they offered the Sinaloa Cartel free transportation of cocaine through Guatemala, unrestricted access to the country's ports and airports, and to appoint a minister of the interior and other public officials who would collaborate with the cartel, according to US prosecutors. According to Voice of America which had access to Estrada's plea deal, the two suspects are collaborating in order to reduce their prison sentences to just 5 years, as well as paying a fine of $5 million. Estrada will be sentenced in January 2020. This admission of guilt now casts a large shadow over Guatemala's President Jimmy Morales and Interior Minister Enrique Degenhart. On October 23, the Guatemala Attorney General's Office launched a new investigation into ties between Morales and Estrada. Central American politics have been in turmoil over the last week, as the Estrada guilty plea came on the heels of Tony Hernandez, brother of Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez, being found guilty of trafficking in New York. But while Estrada's trial has to date not made any direct reference to President Morales, links between the two men surfaced not long after Estrada's capture in Miami. Morales has admitted that he met with Estrada in early April, two weeks before his capture in Miami. The president first dismissed the meeting as just being a friendly lunch but he later revealed he had met Estrada three times. Morales, in addition, had used a helicopter owned by Estrada in January 2018 to open a new police headquarters in San Marcos, Guatemala. He first claimed that the helicopter had been chartered by a third-party company but this was flatly denied by the operator, Maya World Tours. The president and his team have denied having had any knowledge at the time that Estrada had links to drug trafficking. Estrada's new guilty verdict has led prosecutors to take renewed interest in these events. But the links also involve another key member of Morales' cabinet. Enrique Degenhart, the current Interior Minister, has tried to defend Morales' links to Estrada. But his brother, Ernesto Degenhart, was a member of the National Change Union (Union del Cambio Nacionalista -- UCN), the political party for which Estrada has served as secretary-general. A one-time candidate for deputy for the UCN, Ernesto Degenhart is now facing his own investigation for money laundering. Additionally, on October 15, it was revealed that two employees from the Attorney General's Office had tried to extort Degenhart. A court audience heard that the two employees told Degenhart they would avoid issuing an arrest warrant against him in exchange for 85,000 quetzales (around $11,000). As in the Tony Hernandez case, the possible relationship between Morales and a convicted drug dealer in the United States reopens the question about how Washington views its relations with governments in Central America. In Honduras, the Trump administration's support has been vital for President Juan Orlando Hernandez, first during his controversial re-election campaign in 2018 and now during his brother's conviction in New York. On October 19, a day after the verdict was read, US Charge d'Affaires in Honduras Colleen Hoey was photographed accompanying President Hernandez at a military parade. ""The United States is one of the president's main supporters here,"" a diplomat who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, told InSight Crime. Morales has been able to find similar US support for his agenda. His crusade to remove the the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG), which was investigating him for potential illegal campaign financing, was aided by Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. In May 2018, Rubio put a hold on $6 million in funding for the commission following unfounded accusations that the judicial body had unfairly targeted a Russian family in exile in Guatemala for obtaining false documentation from a criminal network."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Dominican Republic, Mexico Sign Security Agreement. In an effort to battle organized crime, the governments of Mexico and the Dominican Republic have signed a new security treaty, agreeing to share intelligence on transnational criminal groups. Dominican President Leonel Fernandez was in Mexico City Tuesday, where he and President Felipe Calderon signed the agreement. According to Calderon, the treaty will establish permanent intelligence-sharing structures between the two countries on matters related to organized crime, establishing a ""united front against criminal activity."" The two leaders also discussed the upcoming elections in their respective countries in 2012, releasing a joint statement on the importance of democratic values. Mexico has signed a number of security treaties with other Latin American countries in recent months, including Colombia , Costa Rica and Argentina , as part of an attempt to rein in organized crime throughout the region.

"Venezuela Interior Minister Replaced Amid Pressure From Militant Collective. Venezuela's interior minister has been replaced, leading some to question whether it may have been due to pressure from a militant collective in Caracas that blamed him for a recent police operation resulting in the death of its leader. On October 24, President Nicolas Maduro announced that Interior Minister Miguel Rodriguez Torres would be replaced by Defense Minister Carmen Melendez, reported BBC. The president claimed that Rodriguez Torres would receive 15 days of vacation before being sent on a ""new strategic mission."" A few days later, Maduro said he would create an executive commission to track police reform in Venezuela, reported El Universal. He also said he would raise the salaries of army personnel by 45 percent. The statement came after Maduro claimed some Caracas police were involved in the recent murder of socialist Congressman Robert Serra, reported EFE. The commission will also reportedly follow the progress of investigative police body the CICPC, which was behind a recent controversial operation that resulted in the deaths of five members of militant collectives. These included a leader of the 5th of March, one of several armed collectives in Caracas by and large support the government. Following the bloody outcome of the CICPC operation earlier this month, the 5th of March adamantly pushed for Rodriguez Torres' resignation, as evidenced in a few of the group's tweets. RODRIGUEZ TORRES DEBE DE PAGAR LA MUERTE DE NUESTROS COMPANEROS: MONTOZA, OTAIZA, SERRA, ODREMAN, MICHEL Y DEMAS COMPATRIOTAS. -- Colectivo 5 de Marzo (Colectivo5M) October 24, 2014 Exigimos la renuncia del ministro Rodriguez Torres RodriguezT_MIJP | 6topoder https://t.co/LyKzWRQayB -- Colectivo 5 de Marzo (Colectivo5M) October 22, 2014 As pointed out by David Smilde and Hugo Perez Hernaiz on the blog Venezuela Politics and Human Rights , we may never actually know what behind-the-scenes negotiations ultimately resulted in the interior minister's resignation, but the timing of the event raises the possibility it was linked to the 5th of March's demands. Maduro's promise to further scrutinize police reform within the CICPC -- coupled with the new interior minister's decision to fire the entire administrative leadership of the police agency -- also comes off as a type of kowtowing to the 5th of March. Collectives like this one have long had a rocky relationship with the the police: in fact, many collectives in Caracas were originally formed in order to combat police abuse and extrajudicial killings. Meanwhile, the government seems set to place security largely in the hands of the military -- a body it has long relied on despite evidence that high-ranking members are involved in drug trafficking. The 5th of March has also been vocal in demanding the resignation of the head of Venezuela's Congress, Diosdado Cabello. But given his status as a top political player and an intimate ally of former President Hugo Chavez, he's unlikely to get pushed out of office anytime soon."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Beating of Jailed Mexican Top Cop Raises Questions of Dirty Politics. A former top police official, jailed for alleged ties to drug traffickers, was reportedly tortured in prison. This could be linked to the ex-cop's feud with one of the most powerful men in the government: Security Minister Genaro Garcia Luna. Former Federal Police coordinator Javier Herrera Valles is among the highest-ranking security officials to be investigated, tried, and sentenced for aiding a drug cartel under the Calderon administration. In December, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and banned from public office for allegedly receiving $70,000 a month in bribes from the Sinaloa Cartel. As veteran crime journalist Ricardo Ravelo reported for Proceso , Herrera's brother now says that a group of men led by a military general tortured Herrera on February 13. They entered Herrera's cell, forced him to strip naked, and beat him savagely, the brother told Proceso. He alleged that the general was acting on the orders of Herrera's best-known enemy: Garcia Luna, Mexico's top police official, who heads the Public Security Department (SSP). The feud between Garcia Luna and Herrera dates back to 2008, when Herrera made public two letters he had addressed to President Felipe Calderon, accusing Garcia Luna of incompetence and political favoritism. The implication of Herrera's complaints was that Garcia Luna, under the guise of cleaning up the SSP, removed the men best suited to the job and replaced them with his allies, in order to protect the Sinaloa Cartel. Garcia Luna has faced accusations of ties to drug cartels for quite some time. Ravelo previously reported for Proceso that Mexico's Attorney General's Office had kept a file on allegations of Garcia Luna's relationships with drug lords since 2005, although he has never been formally investigated. Shortly after Herrera's complaints went public, he was arrested, charged, and eventually imprisoned for ties to various drug cartels. His brother, Arturo, another police commander, was also temporarily detained. The timing of the arrests raised suspicions that Javier Herrera was being punished for attacking one of Calderon's closest confidants, a man whom Herrera once described as ""untouchable."" As another Herrera brother told Proceso, ""It's all a farce, it's a fabrication ordered by Garcia Luna because my brother accused him of trafficking influence, corruption and drug trafficking."" The beating Herrera recently received in prison was a further ""revenge"" carried out on Garcia Luna's orders, the brother added. As Proceso reported, there are additional reasons to believe that Herrera may be serving time on trumped-up charges. One witness who helped build the initial case against Herrera later retracted his testimony. He said that after enduring ""psychological and physical torture,"" SSP officials forced him to sign papers he didn't read, which he later found out accused Herrera of ties to organized crime. The witness later stated, ""I don't know [Herrera] and I've never seen him before."" The other primary witness in Herrera's case, who provided the most elaborate detail on Herrera's supposed dealings with the Sinaloa Cartel, is part of a government witness protection problem, and his identity has not been made public. The long-running feud between Herrera and Garcia Luna raises the question of how often corruption cases against Mexican officials are motivated by personal vendettas. From time to time throughout his administration, Calderon has conducted anti-corruption sweeps, expelling public officials accused of colluding with drug cartels. Herrera was supposed to be an example of justice being done, burnishing the government's credentials as an administration committed to combating organized crime from the inside out. But Herrera's case could instead turn out to be one of the most damning examples of top-level corruption, if the accusations of the ex-cop and his family are proven. "	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"US Calls on Central America Elites to Fund Crime Fight. At a Central American security conference in Guatemala, the U.S. pledged a rise in aid, but called on regional elites to pay their share to make the region safer. At the conference, held in Guatemala, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the U.S. would raise spending to $300 million. Officials said that some of the money was new, and some was repackaged from other pledges, according to the Associated Press. ""Businesses and the rich in every country must pay their fair share of taxes and become full partners in a whole-of-society effort. True security cannot be funded on the backs of the poor,"" stressed Clinton. As InSight Crime has pointed out , low tax rates in Central America impede the effort of governments to fight crime. Countries such as Honduras and El Salvador are considering raising a special security tax to fund law enforcement efforts. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos pressed for regional cooperation at the summit, proposing regional information collection centers in Latin America to better track illicit weapons.

"Drug Clan Highlights Structure of Peru Organized Crime. Authorities in Peru have dismantled a drug trafficking clan and seized over $11 million dollars in assets in a case that sheds light on the nature of Peruvian organized crime and drug trade. On December 11, Peru's Interior Minister Daniel Urresti announced that the anti-drug agency (Dirandro) had seized properties, vehicles, and money belonging to a criminal group dedicated to laundering drug trafficking proceeds, reported La Republica. A total of 15 people were detained and sixteen properties were seized during the first phase of the operation. According to General Vicente Romero Fernandez, the head of Dirandro, the drug trafficking clan is comprised of 25 individuals -- including leader Feliciano Contreras Pino, alias ""Brujo,"" who was captured in 2012 -- and used front companies and proxies to launder money and purchase properties. The group operated between Peru and Bolivia, according to El Comercio , and had been the target of a 2011 operation in Bolivia in which 15 Peruvians were detained. The case of the drug trafficking clan allegedly led by Contreras demonstrates both the structure of criminal organizations in Peru and the importance of Bolivia as a transit nation for Peruvian cocaine. From Bolivia drug shipments can go to the main South American markets of Brazil and Argentina, which also act as transshipment nations for destinations in Europe and Asia. Like many criminal organizations in Peru -- where in some regions small family based clans control drug production and export -- Contreras' group is allegedly comprised of members with familial ties. Peruvian authorities have identified Contreras' romantic partner and her two sisters as part of the group, as well as four siblings currently being prosecuted in Bolivia and two other individuals who share Contreras' last name. In addition, the family clan allegedly moved Peruvian cocaine to Bolivia, which is a major transit point for drug shipments headed to Brazil both for the country's domestic market and en route to Europe and Asia. As of 2011, Contreras allegedly had around $4 million dollars in assets in Santa Cruz, Bolivia , where he has been linked to at least one drug seizure. He was captured in Peru in 2012 and sentenced to 25 years in prison for drug trafficking. Peru does not have powerful cartels like those seen in Mexico and Colombia. Instead it appears that much of the drug trade is in the hands of clans, small groups, often based around family units, which handle smaller loads but still have transnational reach."	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
"5 Strategies to Combat Human Trafficking in the Americas. Human trafficking remains one of world's most profitable criminal industries, but recent initiatives show governments and activists across the Americas are developing new and innovative strategies to tackle the illicit trade. Latin America and the Caribbean are filled with source, transit and destination countries for trafficked people. Organized crime groups often traffic both adults and children for forced labor or, more commonly , for sexual exploitation. While authorities across the region have struggled to effectively tackle human trafficking, recent approaches to combating the crime offer some hope for the future. On this year's World Day against Trafficking in Persons , InSight Crime examines five forward-looking ways to fight this criminal activity. 1. Raise Public Awareness In the past year, some Latin American countries have launched public awareness campaigns that specifically target populations most likely to fall victim to human trafficking. Peru has initiated several such campaigns over the last year, including a radio program called So They Don't Find You. Broadcast multiple times a week in Spanish as well as two officially recognized indigenous languages, the program informs potential victims about traffickers' methods -- which typically involve falsely promising victims well-paid work abroad. ""Public awareness campaigns are an important part of any strategy to combat human trafficking,"" said Cristina Rosero, Senior Attorney at Women's Link Worldwide, an organization that has focused extensively on the trafficking of women in Latin America. However, Rosero told InSight Crime that governments must incorporate a ""wider perspective"" into prevention campaigns by focusing not just on raising awareness about how to identify false job offers, but also on how to prevent poverty and discrimination. 2. Empower Strategic Industries Across the Americas, governments and advocacy groups alike have begun to realize the potential of empowering strategic industries to help identify and report human trafficking. In the United States, the organization Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT) trains commercial truck drivers to identify and report human trafficking to the national human trafficking hotline. The country's millions of truck drivers are ""the eyes and ears of our nation's highways,"" TAT's cofounder, Kylla Lanier, told InSight Crime. ""They see things that other people don't see, and they might be at some of the locations that [traffickers] frequent."" The model has proven so effective that the organization recently partnered with the Mexican organization Consejo Ciudadano to replicate it in Mexico. In December 2017, TAT and Consejo Ciudadano launched a program called Guardians of the Asphalt to provide truck drivers in Mexico with the knowledge and resources necessary to identify and report human trafficking. It's too early to see any significant results from the program in Mexico, but TAT says that since 2007 they have helped identify more than 1,000 trafficking victims in the United States. 3. Look Beyond Traditional Law Enforcement Police clearly play an important role in disrupting human trafficking organizations. But other government agencies can also contribute to these efforts in less obvious ways. As part of a new strategy, Rochelle Keyhan, Director of Disruption Strategies at US anti-trafficking organization Polaris told InSight Crime that the organization has begun training code and liquor enforcement officers on how to recognize sex trafficking in commercial venues. Cities across the United States have strict health and safety codes regulating the operation of businesses such as bars, restaurants and beauty salons. Polaris has been pushing for similar legislation to better regulate establishments such as massage parlors that are often used as fronts for sex trafficking. Training officials in charge of enforcing these regulations has the potential to disrupt commercial fronts for sex trafficking, according to the organization. In San Francisco, for example, the Department of Health utilized massage business regulations to shut down all 250 known illicit massage businesses operating in the city, a spokesperson for Polaris told InSight Crime. It's unlikely that this strategy could feasibly be applied in Latin America and the Caribbean since many countries in the region struggle with enforcing regulatory infractions. However, a significant number of victims from Latin America and the Caribbean are trafficked to the United States, meaning this approach could nevertheless have a considerable impact, at least in the destination country. 4. Develop a Coordinated Transnational Response Because of the transnational nature of most human trafficking, it is imperative that governments work together to tackle the crime. Interpol has become a key venue for multilateral cooperation on anti-trafficking efforts. For example, Operation Intercops - Spartacus III, carried out in two stages in 2016, saw 25 Central and South American countries collaborate to take down seven organized crime networks, arresting 134 suspected traffickers and rescuing 2,700 victims, the international police body reported. ""The effects of this large scale trans-border police operation underlines the value of Interpol in helping police in source, transit, and destination countries work together in tackling the criminal networks behind human trafficking,"" Tim Morris, Interpol's Executive Director for Police Services, said in a press release. Operations of such a large scale are not the norm. But smaller-scale efforts coordinated through Interpol frequently yield important results. In June 2018, for instance, an operation involving Interpol uncovered a trafficking ring exploiting Venezuelan women for sex work in Spain. 5. Follow the Money Money laundering is an essential part of the business model of nearly all criminal organizations, including human trafficking rings. And tracking illicit financial flows can be an effective way to disrupt their activities. In recent years, countries like Argentina have begun to shift their attention towards investigating money laundering tips as a way to identify and prosecute organizations potentially involved in human trafficking. Julie Oppermann, Project Officer for Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking at the United Nations University, told InSight Crime that financial institutions can play an important role in combating human trafficking. Oppermann said that financial data on money laundering related to human trafficking can serve as important corroborating evidence in investigations that typically rely heavily on victim testimony. And beyond alerting authorities about suspicious transactions, financial institutions could strive to eliminate slave labor from their client's supply chains by making the provision of financial services contingent on client's compliance with anti-human trafficking best practices. While Oppermann admitted that there are ""often a lot of interests at play that prevent this from happening,"" she argued that the legal risks financial institutions face for handling funds derived from organized crime should incentivize them to exercise due diligence."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Report Highlights Effects of Colombia Cocaine Boom in US, LatAm. An annual US report on drug trafficking worldwide illustrates drastically increased cocaine availability in the United States and a shift in global trafficking trends, which correspond to a possibly record-breaking peak in coca production in Colombia. The US State Department on March 1 presented Congress with its yearly breakdown of drug trafficking trends, the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report ( INCSR ). (A copy of the report is embedded at the bottom of this article.) The 2017 report strengthens indications that the amount of cocaine flowing globally has increased dramatically, based on recent US government coca cultivation estimates. But the INCSR also suggests that real levels of cocaine heading out of the Andean region are far higher than has been suggested. Firstly, the report states that Guatemala sees around 1,000 metric tons of cocaine cross its borders per year, the ""great majority"" destined for the United States. Total global cocaine flow should therefore be considerably higher, especially considering the vast amounts that are trafficked to Europe. In comparison, the latest UN estimates on global cocaine production are of 746 to 943 metric tons in 2014, while the United States estimates a total of 1,130 metric tons were produced in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia in 2015. But even this looks likely to reach unprecedented levels in the imminent future. According to sources consulted by El Tiempo in Washington, DC, the unpublished 2016 coca count for Colombia could be as high as 200,000 hectares. This would probably be the highest amount on record, based on both US and UN data. And it suggests that an astounding 1,360 metric tons of cocaine are produced in Colombia alone, based on UN estimates of cocaine yield per hectare. Furthermore, the time lag between when coca is cultivated and when it finally hits the streets means that ""the full impact of this surge in coca cultivation likely remains to materialize,"" the INCSR reads. Cocaine Use Up in the United States While the ongoing US opioid epidemic was at the forefront of the INCSR's release, the report supported fears that the continuing explosion in coca bush cultivation has also had strong repercussions farther north. ""There are troubling early signs that cocaine use and availability is on the rise in the United States for the first time in nearly a decade,"" the document reads. It then cites increasing coca cultivation in Colombia, adding that ""this surge in production may be having effects within the United States."" Cocaine use in the United States is indeed rising. First-time users apparently surged 61 percent between 2013 and 2015, while the number of people who died of cocaine overdoses rose 55 percent between 2012 to 2015 to a total of 6,800 deaths, according to a December 2016 report. (See graphic below) This raises the perpetual question of whether suppliers or consumers are responsible for the drug's proliferation, and some observers have been quick to blame Colombian production for ramping up cocaine use further north. Most important, however, is how this will be addressed by government policies. Although the new US administration aims to adopt strong-armed tactics to prevent drugs from entering the country, it has also demonstrated a willingness to tackle domestic consumption as a public health issue. Drug consumption in the United States is not the only cause for concern , as growing consumer markets within Latin America have been strengthening local criminal organizations. The INCSR suggests drug use is increasing in major transhipment countries such as El Salvador, Panama, Belize, Argentina and Brazil. Shifting Routes Another indicator of greater cocaine flow to the United States is the steep rise in seizures by countries in Central America and Mexico, a region which sees the passage of some 90 percent of the cocaine heading to the US market, according to the INCSR. This rise has mostly occurred in countries with longer Pacific coastlines. Guatemala, for example, saw a record 18.5 metric tons of cocaine seized in 2016. The report added that the discovery of the first ever semi-submersible to be constructed in Guatemala suggested that ""drug trafficking organizations in Guatemala are becoming more sophisticated."" The discovery of the maritime vessel also suggested a departure from the standard drug trafficking modus operandi in the country, which is mostly ""overland."" El Salvador displayed a comparable trend in 2016 when around 12.2 metric tons of cocaine were seized, or more than four times the amount confiscated in 2015. In Mexico, cocaine seizures rose 183 percent to 10.2 metric tons between April 2014 and September 2015, and seizures of methamphetamine, opium gum and marijuana also increased substantially. However, more recent data from the Mexican government shows declining seizure trends for all of these categories of drugs in the first half of 2016. Costa Rican authorities seized a total of 24.5 metric tons of cocaine last year, a 44 percent increase over 2015. Panama saw a slight rise in cocaine seizures. These patterns apparently reflect the evolving operations of Colombian crime syndicates. As InSight Crime has pointed out in the past, these groups appear to be shifting their routes to the Pacific coast, partly in response to a government crackdown on drug traffickers operating in the Caribbean region. Over the past few years, the proportion of seizures made in Colombia's Pacific departments compared to the rest of the country jumped from 21 percent in 2014 to 44 percent in 2016. (See graphic below) Drug-laden semi-submersibles of the kind found in Guatemala appear to have been gaining popularity in Colombia's Pacific region, with a ""historic"" numbers confiscated in the country in 2016, according to El Tiempo. This current flux could place added strain on interdiction authorities in Central America, as well as push up local cocaine usage as more cocaine is available on the ground -- a phenomenon that has been exemplified in key transit countries like Brazil and Argentina. Adding to this is the fact that drug traffickers often pay local ""sub-contracted"" groups in product rather than in cash, which has sparked turf wars over domestic drug sales in numerous Latin American countries. And as is already the case not only in Guatemala, but notably in Panama and Costa Rica as well, these local gangs will likely grow in sophistication as their countries gain importance along these strategic drug routes.

"Did El Salvadors Iron Fist Lower Homicide Rate?El Salvador officials have attributed a steady decline in the violence-wracked country's homicide rate to the government's crackdown on gangs, but it is too early to confirm this causal relationship or to determine whether the improvement will endure. Howard Coto, director of the National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil- PNC) announced the lower homicide rates in a June 7 press conference. Coto said homicides dropped from an average 23.8 per day in January to a daily average of 11.3 in May. Homicides declined gradually over the first five months of the year, registering a rate of 22.9 per day in February, 19.7 in March, and 11.7 in April. He added that figures for the first week of June indicated the drop is set to continue, with an average of 7 per day. La Prensa Grafica reported the total number of homicides for the first five months of 2016 at 2,705. The trend for the year so far represents a dramatic reversal from the upwards trend registered from the beginning of 2015, which saw the daily homicide average increase from 10.8 in January to 20.7 in May. The lower homicide statistics come as El Salvador continues to push its ""Mano Dura"" (Iron Fist) security policies. At the beginning of April, the government enacted a package of ""extraordinary measures"" designed to combat the country's powerful ""mara"" street gangs, most notably the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Barrio 18. The measures target the ability of imprisoned gang leaders to effectively operate from behind bars. Additionally, the government has created a new anti-gang rapid response force , passed legal reforms that reclassify gang crimes as terrorism, and recently announced the deployment of 400 additional armed forces reservists to tackle insecurity in capital city San Salvador. Minister of Security Mauricio Ramirez Landaverde said the new security measures have directly contributed to the lower homicide rate, La Prensa Grafica reported. While lower homicide trends are a positive sign, the overall security situation in El Salvador remains dire. The country is still wracked by criminal violence, and it is unclear how effective the government's hardline approach to the issue has been. The militarization of the gang conflict has also lead to concerns about human rights violations , as lopsided body counts are reported in what security forces describe as clashes with criminal gangs. The most dramatic decrease in daily homicide rates actually came in April after gang leaders themselves ordered their members to stop the killing in an unsuccessful attempt to dissuade the government from enacting the extraordinary measures. In subsequent public statements representatives of the gangs have taken credit for the lower murder rate and threatened to step up their violence if the government persists with its hard line. However, the jury is still out on precisely what has caused the daily murder rate to fall and whether or not the reduced rate will hold."	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Mexico and Colombia Victims Laws: Broad Enough to Bring Justice?Mexico has followed Colombia's footsteps by passing a sweeping law that aims to compensate victims of the country's drug war. Both projects are incredibly ambitious, and may yet heal some of the wounds left by years of violence -- if implemented correctly. On January 9, Mexico's new president signed a new law to help and compensate victims of crime and human rights violations, hailing it as an advance unprecedented anywhere in the world. President Enrique Pena Nieto said that, with the measure, the Mexican government was putting people at the center of its policy, giving ""hope and assistance"" to the ""thousands"" who had suffered from violence. The central aim of the law, which was first proposed by activist groups, is to set out the rights of victims to receive protection and financial aid from the government. Under the law, the government will set up specialized bodies to help victims, including a committee to oversee assistance, a compensation fund, and a register of the dead and disappeared. The Victims Law officially came into force on February 8, just over a year after a similar project to compensate victims was launched in Colombia. Both countries have many thousands of people who have been abused, displaced, or have lost relatives to a conflict driven by the drug trade. And both countries continue to generate new victims each day. Even though the Victims Laws in Mexico and Colombia pursue the same overall aim, the two pieces of legislation have significant differences on how to identify victims, and how to go about recompensing them. Some of the most important differences include: 1. Defining the Victims In both Colombia and Mexico, those personally affected by the conflict, as well as relatives of those who have died or disappeared, can apply for compensation. However, as it currently stands, Mexico's law does not set restrictions on who can claim to be a victim. This means that, in theory, the law could apply to members of organized criminal groups , behind much of the violence. Colombia's law blocks members of armed groups from receiving compensation, with the exception of those who were recruited as minors, and demobilized while still under the age of 18. Another key difference is that Mexico's Victims Law covers those harmed by common criminals and organized criminal groups. In contrast, Colombia's law is restricted to abuses committed ""in connection with the armed conflict."" This implies that the law will apply only to those abused by groups involved in Colombia's nearly 50-year civil conflict, namely the guerrillas, paramilitaries, and state forces. This leaves a major gap, potentially excluding victims of Colombia's common criminals and drug trafficking organizations , who carry out equally brutal acts. 2. Compensation The Victims Laws in both Mexico and Colombia pledge compensation for victims of abuse by state authorities. This is key, as both countries have seen widespread abuse by the security forces. In Colombia, perhaps the most painful example of such abuse was the ""false positives"" scandal, in which elements in the military killed civilians and then presented their bodies as guerrillas killed in combat. There are thought to be some 3,000 victims of these ""false positive"" killings. In Mexico, there is evidence that state agents have forcibly ""disappeared"" thousands during the campaign against organized crime initiated under President Felipe Calderon. Mexico sets no time limit for awarding compensation -- meaning that even victims of the country's ""Dirty War"" in the 1960s and 1970s would, in theory, be included. Meanwhile, in Colombia the government will only give compensation for crimes dating back to 1985 (or 1991 for land restitution cases). Those who suffered abuses prior to these dates can ask that their case be investigated, but cannot file for financial reparations. Mexico sets a higher limit on compensation; the state will cover claims for up to 1 million pesos (about $78,000) in cases where the person responsible for the crime cannot pay. Colombia sets tighter limits on compensation, agreeing to cover claims worth some 40 minimum monthly wages -- currently about $12,000. President Juan Manuel Santos has acknowledged that the sum ought to be higher, but said that this is not possible given the large number of potential claimants. One positive side effect of offering compensation might be to encourage the Mexican state to carry out more effective investigations, as Brisa Maya, director of the National Center of Social Communication (CENCOS) pointed out to InSight Crime. The responsibility for paying damages only falls to the government if the person responsible for the crime cannot be located, or is unable to pay, giving the government a strong incentive to locate and convict the guilty party. Both Colombia and Mexico are trying to fund reparations with assets seized from criminals. As seen so far in Colombia, such an approach will likely prove slow and difficult, as it can take years to legally confiscate property even from very high profile criminals. 3. The Results so Far Colombia's Victims Law has been a disappointment in many ways, stalled by threats and attacks against those trying to reclaim land, and by the sheer administrative difficulty of administering the project. Since the law came into effect in January 2012, the government claims to have paid out $518 million to some 158,000 people, and plans to have compensated a total of 260,000 people by the end of 2013. The budget for the scheme in 2013 is some $3.3 billion, about $300 million of which is for reparations, and it is expected to cost $30 billion over 10 years. The government estimates that there are 4 million people who will have the right to claim reparations or land restitution. In Mexico, the Interior Ministry admitted last month that it did not have a figure for how many people are likely to make claims. It has set a budget of some $465,000 for the National System for Attention to Victims in 2013. The cost of paying reparations to Mexico's victims is still unknown. The law has been strongly criticized for not including a budget plan -- as one academic pointed out, ""A law which does not have an assessment of how much it is going to cost isn't a law, it's rhetoric."" Moving forward Mexico's Victims Law is not considered to be the final version. Pena Nieto and the law's supporters said that the priority was to get the measure onto the books, then revise it later. The Senate is currently considering changes proposed by a coalition of social movements, meaning the law will likely see face revisions in the near future. Mexico and Colombia are currently facing similar challenges in battling the fragments of once-united drug trafficking cartels, now believed responsible for much of the violence in the two countries. But while the security problems facing Mexico and Colombia are comparable, the two nations ended up approving very different Victims Laws, underlying the differences between the two conflicts. In the coming years, both countries will likely face more bumps in the road in ensuring that the legislation does in fact provide justice for victims. The laws do provide some hope, but it is time for the victims in both Colombia and Mexico to receive something more substantial."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Justiciabarometro: Survey of Judges, Prosecutors, and Public Defenders in Nine Mexican States. The Justice in Mexico Project 's survey of legal professionals' views on the criminal justice system in nine Mexican states. Over 268 judges, prosecutors and public defenders were contacted for the survey, which sought their opinions on issues including corruption, the state of their profession, and the 2008 justice system reforms. An excerpt from the preface: Data on Mexican legal professions are scarce. While there are many widely available statistical indicators about crime, victimization, and public opinion on the rule of law in Mexico, there have been few systematic, quantitative efforts to gauge the current levels of professional development, working conditions, and attitudes of the primary operators of the Mexican justice system, namely police, prosecutors, public defenders, and judges. Due in part to this lack of knowledge on legal professionals, Mexico's criminal justice system remains an enormous ""black box"" whose internal weaknesses are often readily recognized but difficult to quantify. In 2009, the Justice in Mexico Project, a multi-year research initiative coordinated by the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego (USD), launched a series of studies to evaluate the perceptions and professional development of actors in Mexico's judicial sector. Working with an interdisciplinary, bi-national team of experts on Mexico's justice sector, this series of studies -- titled the Justiciabarometro, or ""Justice Barometer"" -- consists of surveys, interviews, and policy research to examine the strengths, challenges, and resource needs of Mexican law enforcement agencies and judicial institutions, and the justice sector in general. The initial Justiciabarometro study consisted of amajor academic survey of municipal police in 2009, including 5,422 local law enforcement personnelin the six municipal governments that make up the Guadalajara metropolitan area. In 2010, a subsequent police study was conducted, involving more than 2,400 local police in the municipality of Ciudad Juarez, a city that has had a series of brutal homicides targeting women since the 1990s and severe levels of crime and violence since early 2008. From the key findings highlighted in the executive summary: New judicial reforms seen by some ineffective, a result of foreign influence, and unlikely to reduce crime. Respondents were split on the effectiveness and efficiency of Mexico's traditional criminal justice system, on whether that system was deliberately discredited to make way for the 2008 judicial reform, on whether foreign interests were behind the new judicial system, and whether judicial reform will reduce criminality. Even so, new criminal procedures are generally well regarded, especially in states still awaiting reform. Still, the provisions included in the 2008 reforms -- introducing oral, adversarial criminal procedures -- were well regarded, particularly in states where they had not yet taken effect; the most significant reservations tended to register among respondents from states that had already adopted the reforms for some time. Many respondents are optimistic that it will improve efficiency and reduce corruption in the judicial system. Find the complete study here ( pdf ).

"Venezuela Cracks On With Police Reform. Venezuela has taken another step in the overhaul of its dysfunctional and often corrupt police force, announcing that the notorious Caracas Metropolitan Police (PM) will be dissolved over the next 90 days. The process of police reform has been ongoing in this socialist country since 2006, when the government tasked a commission with making recommendations on how to improve the institution, renowned for its brutality and incompetence. The commission called for a more centralized national police force, among other things. This materialized in the form of the National Bolivarian Police (Policia Nacional Bolivariana - PNB), set up in late 2009 to replace the various local and state level forces, a process which is still underway. The PNB is gradually being expanded, and in two years will be the only police force in Venezuela. The removal of the Caracas force is a major step in this process, as it had one of the worst records of violence in the country. The government said Wednesday that around half of its members would be retired, while the other half would be incorporated into the new national force. The Venezuelan police are in serious need of an overhaul. Even the government admitted in 2009 that the police were responsible for up to 20% of all crimes, especially violent ones such as murder and kidnapping. One NGO found that killings of civilians by the police more than doubled between 2006 and 2009, to more than 2,600 cases a year, incidents which are not counted in the already soaring official murder rates. Various organizations have tracked the frequent reports of torture and arbitrary detentions. Rising crime has become the foremost public complaint in Venezuela, and another reason it is so important to clean up the police is that the country is becoming an ever-more important transit nation for drug trafficking. Security advances in Colombia have pushed criminal organizations over the border into its now more chaotic neighbor. Underfunded and corrupt police forces are the lifeblood of these criminal groups, which rely on the security forces being easily bribed to ignore, or better still disposed to assist, their operations. Venezuela's efforts to centralize and improve the police have been met with international praise. Human Rights Watch, for example, said that the reform commission stood out as a rare example of the government constructively engaging with civil society. The reforms are not just skin-deep, but involve integrated measures that are crucial to properly tackling corruption. The government has raised the salaries of the police, so that PNB officers now earn three times the average wage of the old local police forces. Venezuela is also trying to improve vetting procedures to stop officers with spotty records from joining the new force, as shown by the fact that a half of the Caracas Metropolitan Police will be retired. They are also aiming to give better training to the national force, including education in human rights and ethics. Representatives of the non-governmental Justice and Peace Support Network ( Red de Apoyo por la Justicia y la Paz ), a long-time critic of police abuses, are teaching at the new National Experimental Police University. The increased centralization could also work to raise standards, making the force more efficient and coordinated. The government has claimed victory, releasing numerous pronouncements on the new force's achievements. Pro-Chavez newspaper Correa del Orinoco said in March that the rates of arrests of murderers and drug dealers soared in the first two months of 2011, up almost five-fold and more than ten-fold, respectively, due to the introduction of the PNB. The president has declared optimistically that the force is a ""friend"" of the people, unlike the old, ""repressive"" units. But critics say that the police reform is aimed less at stopping police brutality than at bringing the police under the president's control. Hugo Chavez has, in the course of his twelve years in power, chipped away at the independence of various state institutions, including the judiciary and the armed forces, and the new national, centralized police force will be more answerable to his government. Some members of the to-be-dissolved Caracas force were convicted of taking part in a 2002 coup attempt, giving the Chavez government another good reason to want it gone. There have already been reports of abuses by new body. There were stories about the NPB using heavy-handed tactics in November to break up protests, arresting dozens of apparently peaceful protesters. Non-governmental human rights organization Povea told press that this cast into doubt whether the national body will be different from the Caracas force they were intended to replace. The progress of Venezuelan police reform has comparisons to the process underway in Mexico , also a center for organized criminal groups and with corrupt and highly decentralized police forces. The government has been trying to bring the various local forces under more unified state command. So far Mexico's efforts have met with only limited success, highlighting the fact that effective police reform needs to be part of a much wider strengthening of institutions, particularly the judiciary - a kind of wide-ranging reform which is unlikely to take place in Chavez's Venezuela.

"Bloodshed in Northeast Mexico Points to Cartel Turmoil. A recent wave of mass killings in Mexico 's northeast could point to a succession battle in the Gulf Cartel , whose leader "" El Coss "" was arrested last week. In the border city of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas , nine bodies were found on a bridge on Friday, reported the AFP. A ""narco-banner,"" signed in the name of a drug gang, was left next to the bodies, but its contents have not been revealed by authorities. Seven more corpses were dumped on a highway in the municipality of San Fernando, also in Tamaulipas , the same day, reported Milenio. All 16 had been killed by gunshots, and most had their hands tied. In the neighboring state Nuevo Leon, seven people were executed in a mechanics shop in the city of Monterrey, Blog del Narco reported. Gulf Cartel leader Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez, alias "" El Coss ,"" was captured in Tamaulipas two days before the bodies were found. It is possible that the killings were prompted by supporters seeking revenge for the capture -- the drug boss was reportedly arrested after a group of his bodyguards led marines to his house. There has been bitter infighting within the Gulf Cartel in recent years, and according to some reports El Coss had been carrying out a campaign of betraying his associates to the authorities in order to rid himself of rivals. Gulf boss Mario Cardenas Guillen or ""El Gordo"" was captured on September 3, and may have handed over information to the authorities about El Coss. Another possibility is that these mass killings are part of a bid by one of his associates to gain control of the cartel. The death and capture of many of the Gulf Cartel old guard has left the drug trafficking organization without a clear leader to succeed El Coss. Mexican media reports say that a Gulf lieutenant named Mario Armando Ramirez Trevino , alias ""X-20"" or ""Pelon,"" (pictured, above) may be poised to take control of the organization. He is thought to be the current head of the Reynosa ""plaza,"" or drug trafficking territory, and Vanguardia reported that his ascension to the leadership could mean the end of the divide between rival factions the Rojos and the Metros. However, the massacres in northeast Mexico may not be related to El Coss' capture. The Gulf Cartel is disputing the region with the Zetas, which is currently in the throes of a bloody split between its two main leaders. Like the arrest of the Gulf boss, the break between Heriberto Lazcano, alias ""El Lazca,"" and Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, alias ""Z-40,"" has shaken up the dynamics in Mexico's underworld, and is likely to cause more bloodshed in their territory.

"Why Does Latin America Have the Worlds Highest Female Murder Rates?Latin America is the region with the most female murders on earth, a phenomenon partly due to organized crime activities such as human trafficking and gang violence. Just how do these criminal activities increase the victimization of women? A recent report by a number of international organizations revealed that seven out of the ten countries with the highest female murder rate in the world are in Latin America. El Salvador heads the list with a rate of 8.9 homicides per 100,000 women in 2012, followed by Colombia with 6.3, Guatemala with 6.2, Russia with 5.3 and Brazil with 4.8. Mexico and Suriname are also in the top ten. While general violence levels and domestic abuse are considered to be the main contributors to high femicide rates, organized crime also plays a huge yet overlooked role in the victimization of women in Latin America. As Guatemala's Attorney General Thelma Aldana told InSight Crime, 50 percent of the 854 women killed in Guatemala in 2015 were murdered as a direct result of organized crime. Human Trafficking and Female Murders ""The only case in which you can make a case that femicide is increasing as a result of transnational organized crime is human trafficking."" Human trafficking is a vast illegal economy in Latin America, and one that disproportionately affects women and girls. ""The only case in which you can make a case that femicide is increasing as a result of transnational organized crime is human trafficking in Central America and the Caribbean,"" InSight Crime was told by the Representative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Regional Office for Central America and the Caribbean, Amado Philip de Andres. Human trafficking victims to and from the region -- the majority of which are females between the ages of 18 and 28 -- are on the increase, and so are the number of fatalities. ""The femicide rate in cases of human trafficking for victims is very, very high,"" de Andres said. ""Especially for the purposes of sexual exploitation, which might account for 91 or 92 percent of the cases."" Female victims from across the region as well as other areas, such as Eastern Europe, are tricked into working in the sex trade where they are tortured, raped, and often murdered. One of the most troubling aspects of this form of crime is that, as de Andres points out, the woman's ""victimization never ends."" Even if the victims manage to escape or are rescued, they may be killed in retaliation, or even fall back into the trade if they are not given sufficient attention and alternative work opportunities, which they rarely are. Widespread impunity in human trafficking cases, fear of denouncing crimes, and the huge profitability of the market -- up to $320 million a year in the region alone, according to the UNODC official -- causes the victimization of women to be an ongoing reality. Women and girls are increasingly becoming victims of other variations of the crime, including a lucrative and often deadly illegal organ trafficking industry and the smuggling of migrants. Gang Violence Another Latin American phenomenon that can help explain the high rate of female murders is the presence of gangs. The Maras became a gang member's true ""family,"" while relatives became gang ""property."" While the majority of gang-related deaths are men, one of the fundamental threats to women is that they are considered to be the property of gang members. This is arguably the result of the origins of gangs themselves. According de Andres of the UNODC, femicides linked to Central America's Mara gangs can be traced back to Los Angeles in the 1980s, where the Maras first arose. As the Maras developed, a new form of social cohesion arose -- one which continues to be an essential trait of these groups today -- in which the Maras became a gang member's true ""family,"" while relatives became gang ""property,"" de Andres told InSight Crime. Consequently, during disputes between gangs, women are frequently caught in the crossfire, with girlfriends, sisters, and mothers targeted by rival gangs. In many cases, female relatives of imprisoned Mara members make easy targets for revenge killings, as the male is unable to protect them. What's more, according to the Mara ""code of honour,"" if a member betrays or abandons his own gang their most vulnerable ""possession"" is attacked -- which usually means the rape or murder of his sister or wife, de Andres explained. Girlfriends are also vulnerable. While men are seldom punished for infidelity, women can be killed for such behaviour. The oft-studied case of Mexico's Juarez, which saw 400 femicides between 1990 and 2005, is illustrative of how femicides often involve ""symbolic"" effects. Murdered women in Juarez were found to have undergone torture, rape, mutilation -- especially of the sexual organs and breasts, and decapitation. But those signs of torture are more anomalies in the pattern than the rule. Of the 400 cases documented in Juarez, all but 100 were resolved, and most of those cases involved domestic partners or people that the victim knew. Nonetheless, the brutal tactics seen on some of the victims do appear to be a means of delivering a message and are still common today, particularly in the Northern Triangle. According to Aldana, these brutal tactics not only bear the clear markings of organized crime, they are also an expression of misogyny. ""The difference in Guatemala between the death of a man and the death of a woman is that the woman is raped before she is killed, she is mutilated This does not happen to me n It is clear to see how misogyny is present up until the moment of a woman's death,"" she told InSight Crime. Women Who Work in Crime Femicides can also be high among women who become members of criminal organizations. ""Within organized crime, patriarchal structures and traditional gender roles continue to be reproduced,"" the Criminal Policy Unit of Colombia's Justice Ministry told InSight Crime. Indeed, women seldom occupy higher positions in an organization, and are rather used for menial, but often dangerous tasks. A Barrio 18 woman in a 2008 documentary about El Salvador gangs, ""La Vida Loca"" Perhaps the most high-profile of these largely female roles is the ""mula"" -- or drug ""mule"". This duty can all too frequently lead to death if drugs enter a woman's bloodstream, and she can also be killed as punishment for getting caught. In other criminal structures, women can be used as expendable members, working as extortion collectors or as drug dealers. Ending the Cycle Femicide and the overwhelming impunity surrounding it is a hot topic for law enforcement around the region. ""The law does not protect women who are involved in organized crime."" A fundamental problem hindering progress is that, as Guatemala Attorney General Aldana point s out, "" The law does not protect women who are involved in organized crime."" This is despite the fact that many women are co-opted into joining criminal structures. According to the attorney general, prosecutors need be disciplined enough to understand the difference between women who become involved with criminal organizations willingly and those are forced to join due to economic dependence, or other reasons. De Andres agrees that, although the legislation defining and criminalizing femicides is strong in many Latin American countries, what is lacking is prosecution and prevention. Re-victimization is a critical issue that can be resolved by increasing attention to victims, as well as protecting those who put themselves at risk by becoming witnesses. Given the nature of organized crime, international action is essential in preventing femicides. One response to this issue is a new UNODC-backed ""Blue Heart"" Campaign , which looks to raise awareness on human trafficking on transnational flights. Thelma Aldana, the Attorney General of Guatemala In Guatemala, the government established a specific law regarding femicide in 2008; launched a task force , created a special court for hearing these cases, and established a center where victims can give testimony and receive psychological treatment in the same place. Most recently, Aldana announced a Prosecutor's Office for Femicides's Office for Femicides that should be inaugurated in March 2016. And yet, she admits that there continues to be a discouraging resistance to the subject of femicides in her country. ""It is incredibly difficult for laws to be issued in favor of women to introduce a law requiring the judiciary to take a gendered approach in cases in which a woman is involved in crime, it can't be so,"" she said. ""I think we're a long way away from this way of working."""	0	0	0	1	0	0	1
"US Adds Guatemalan Drug Queen to Blacklist. The United States Treasury Department has designated a little-known Guatemalan woman as major criminal force in the country, as well as the region. The Treasury added Marllory Dadiana Chacon Rossell, as well as seven other individuals and companies*to its list of Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers, preventing US citizens from doing business with any of them. According to a press release by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the 39-year-old Guatemalan woman is ""one of the most prolific narcotics traffickers in Central America,"" whose connections to Mexican cartels make her a ""critical figure"" in the drug trade. Chacon is also accused of running a money laundering network with operations in Honduras and Panama, using a string of individuals and companies across the region to launder illicit profits. The OFAC claims that she is ""the most active money launderer in Guatemala."" The Treasury's organizational chart of Chacon's network (see below) provides an interesting look into her criminal ventures. As InSight Crime has pointed out , it is relatively rare for a woman to be at the helm of such a large scale criminal organization, giving orders to men. Women that are, such as Sandra Avila, the ""Queen of the Pacific,"" frequently owe much of their power to either family ties or romantic connections with influential men. But the case of Marllory Chacon is different. The OFAC press release says that her husband merely provides ""logistical support for his wife's organization,"" suggesting that Chacon is the organization's sole leader. As occurred in Mexico with Sandra Avila, the Guatemalan press is sure to have a field day with this indictment. One publication, the Guatemala City-based elPeriodico , is already referring to Chacon as ""The Narco Queen."" Despite this hype, it is worth remembering that she is far from the largest criminal threat in the country. Powerful crime families such as the Mendozas and Lorenzanas exert an immense amount of influence in Guatemala, and Mexican groups such as the Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel have drastically increased their operations there over the past few years.

"Video Shows Familia Michoacana Threatening Mayor. A video has emerged that appears to show the mayor of a city in Guerrero state negotiating with members of the Familia Michoacana gang, illustrating the difficulties and dangers that Mexican officials face from organized criminal groups. The five minute video, which appeared earlier this week on YouTube and has been distributed by Blog del Narco, shows Teloloapan Mayor Ignacio de Jesus Valladares speaking to two unseen men who identify themselves as members of the Familia Michoacana. The men are heard pressuring Salgado to ""make a pact"" with the Familia and to appoint a director of public security who will stay out of the group's business and ""keep peace in the town."" The mayor, clearly frightened and trying to speak carefully, promises to choose someone neutral. Toward the end of the video, one of the men says that if the mayor does not keep the police from interfering with the group's interests, ""Teloloapan will burn."" Salgado, a member of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) who was elected in July, has stated that the conversation took place against his will. In an interview with Radio Formula , he suggested that he may have to resign due to safety concerns. Other members of his party in Guerrero have expressed their support for the mayor, pending an investigation into the incident, reports Milenio. The video is an unusually clear example of the pressure that criminal groups put on Mexican officials. In their efforts to gain control over municipal security forces, criminal groups are especially interested in influencing mayors, who appoint police chiefs and the local directors of security, as seen in the video. For mayors who refuse to cooperate or who get caught in disputes between rival groups, the consequences can be deadly. According to a recent report by El Informador , 28 mayors have been killed since President Felipe Calderon took office in December 2006."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Cocaine Hidden in Fruit Feeds European Pipeline. The discovery of large batches of cocaine in shipments of bananas to the Rotterdam port shows that traffickers continue to move drugs to Europe through a common Latin American export: fruit. The latest bust occurred on September 30, when customs officials discovered 1,500 kilograms of cocaine hidden in a shipment of bananas at the Rotterdam port in the Netherlands, according to a news release by Rotterdam prosecutors. Drug smuggling activity at the Port of Rotterdam -- Europe's largest port and a gateway to the continent -- has surged in recent years. In April, 1,600 kilograms of cocaine -- also concealed in banana cargo from Costa Rica -- was seized. The size of the drug shipments have also increased, according to a police expert who spoke with Dutch national newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. ""Before we used to be impressed by 500-kilogram batches,"" he said. ""Now we seize 5,000-kilogram shipments, meaning that these quantities also enter the country."" An estimated 60 percent of cocaine trafficked to Europe in 2018 came through the ports of Rotterdam and Belgian port city of Antwerp, according to the Dutch newspaper. Most cocaine arriving in Antwerp is brought to the Netherlands , where it is distributed farther into Europe. Fruit containers with cocaine also enter the Dutch port of Vlissingen, where 700 million kilograms of bananas a year arrive in a specialized terminal. The large amount of cocaine seized at the port of Rotterdam in the banana shipments underscores that fruit remains a favored cargo for concealing drugs. It is so for three reasons. First, produce from Latin America, particularly fruit, is constantly moving through the busy Rotterdam port. Outside random inspections, only certain containers are flagged for search upon arrival at the port, leaving more than 99 percent unchecked , according to a report by Erasmus University Rotterdam researchers. Second, fruit -- especially bananas -- spoils quickly, so shipments can't be held by customs for long. Third, importing a shipping container of bananas can cost as little as 15,000 euros (about $17,000) -- less than the wholesale value of a kilogram of cocaine in Europe, which sells for about 25,000 euros ($28,000). The increasing use of produce cargo as a cover for cocaine, however, has brought crime groups to the Netherlands. For example, in June, criminals demanded 1.2 million euros (about $1.3 million) from ""De Groot Fresh Group,"" threatening that they would kill one of the fruit importer's employees if their demand was not met. Fruit importers have also been directly involved in criminal activity. For example, a Dutch man convicted of laundering drug money owned several fruit import companies suspected of being used for cocaine smuggling. In 2014, a fruit importer was murdered after he lost 300 kilograms of cocaine to authorities. Unable to search all or even most produce cargo containers, Dutch authorities have set their sights on dismantling these illegal fruit import companies. For example, joint operation Piggyback in May 2019 identified more than 30 suspect fruit importers. Companies that, for instance, only had a postal address or could be linked to questionable transactions, were flagged as suspicious. Such operations go beyond mere seizures -- though authorities did capture 1,500 kilograms of cocaine during the Piggyback operation -- but also provide valuable intelligence on the underlying criminal structures moving cocaine to the Netherlands."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Nicaragua Latest Central American Country to Deny Paramilitary Abuse. Nicaragua's military chief has denied the presence of paramilitary groups in the embattled country, becoming the latest Central American country to do so despite clear evidence of their involvement in human rights abuses. Speaking at an event to mark the 40 th anniversary of the army's foundation, Army Commander Julio Cesar Aviles claimed there was no evidence of any paramilitary activity in Nicaragua, El Nuevo Diario reported. ""Under no circumstances do we accept the term paramilitary forces,"" he said during the press conference, adding that the military had fallen victim to a smear campaign. SEE ALSO : Nicaragua News and Profiles His comments mark the first time that the army has discussed the issue of paramilitary presence in the country, according to Confidencial , after facing mounting criticism about the role of armed civilian groups in repressing anti-government protests following the outbreak of political unrest in April 2018. Aviles' stance mirrors that of the administration. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has denied any connection to the squads, having previously referred to paramilitary troops as ""voluntary police."" However, the United Nations and other international organizations have documented and denounced the participation of pro-government armed groups in the repression of protests. These armed battalions have been implicated in the deaths of at least 150 people since the start of political unrest, according to EFE. The Nicaraguan military's efforts to distance itself from paramilitary activity is a sign of the army's continuing allegiance to the Ortega regime. For the embattled president, support from the military and pro-government armed groups is essential for fending off the civilian uprisings which threaten his grasp on power. With Aviles' announcement, Nicaragua has become the latest Central American country to deny atrocities committed by paramilitary groups. Guatemala, similarly to Nicaragua, has not faced up to its paramilitary death squads. A proven leader of one of these outfits, Kamilo Rivera , was until last year the country's deputy interior minister. During Guatemala's 36-year civil war between 1960 and 1996, the military created civilian militia groups known as Civil Defense Patrols (Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil - PAC), which were responsible for the majority of an estimated 20,000 deaths and disappearances during the conflict, as well as over one million displaced Guatemalans. SEE ALSO : Could Nicaragua 'Parapolice' Groups Turn Criminal? Neighboring El Salvador has also been reluctant to investigate allegations that senior officers of its national police created criminal networks engaging in extrajudicial killings, sexual assault and extortion. In Honduras, the former national police director, Juan Carlos ""El Tigre"" Bonilla, allegedly linked to death squads , has not been found guilty of any crimes. Throughout the region, governments on both sides of the political spectrum have used paramilitaries as a means of repressing and intimidating armed or civilian groups which challenge their authority. In other cases, paramilitary death squads have mutated out of state security forces and facilitated the killing of Central American gang members. In Nicaragua, bands of hooded paramilitaries have allegedly been raiding towns , firing on unarmed protesters, burning homes and kidnapping opponents. The squads have additionally been accused of using military-grade weapons to attack protestors, alongside committing extrajudicial killings , kidnappings and callous forms of torture ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Intelligence Report Details Role of Guatemala Police in Drug Trade. A report allegedly produced for US anti-drug and intelligence agencies has detailed how corrupt factions of Guatemala's police -- including high-level officers -- dedicate themselves to stealing and reselling drug shipments, among other illicit activities. The report, reprinted in elPeriodico , called these corrupt police the ""Charola Cartel"" (""charola"" being a reference to police insignia), and said they emerged after drug traffickers began paying Guatemalan police officers to protect their drug shipments in the 1990s. Some officers allegedly began stealing these shipments (a practice known as a ""tumbe"") and selling them to traffickers based along the Guatemala-Mexico frontier. elPeriodico did not specify how it obtained the intelligence report or identify the authors or date of completion, but stated that the version of the report was ""unedited."" The report stated that there were two factions within the Charola Cartel, both led by former deputy police directors: Henry Ruben Lopez Gomez (who held the position from April 2007 to September 2008), and Rember Larios Tobar (who succeeded Lopez, and had the job until June 2009). According to the report, the two were formerly rivals, but began working together circa 2008. Lopez controlled the local police chiefs who participated in their scheme, while Larios ensured that the police internal affairs unit never investigated them. The report described how Larios personally participated in various ""tumbes,"" stealing an 800 kilo cocaine shipment in 2009 and selling it to the owner of a bus company who worked for notorious Guatemalan drug trafficker Juan Ortiz Lopez, alias "" Juan Chamale ."" Larios and other police officers also stole several bags of cash belonging to Mexico's Zetas, who retaliated by attacking police patrols across Guatemala, the report stated. The report states that the Charola Cartel is estimated to have more than 1,000 active members. The lack of context on who authored this report, or when, makes it impossible to say why it was written. Nevertheless, as it stands, the report offers an eye-opening look at the alleged extent of police involvement in Guatemala's drug trade. What is perhaps most troubling is the implication that this wasn't a case of low-level officers acting independently, but was widespread and involved the top leadership. The so-called ""Charola Cartel"" seems akin to Venezuela's Cartel of the Suns , a drug trafficking network made up of the security forces, particulary the military and National Guard. The report also makes reference to the lack of serious effort to clean up the police force. It notes that the police anti-narcotics unit has undergone several rehauls and changed its name multiple times since the early 2000s, but kept the same employees in place. This lack of proper vetting may not have been limited to the Guatelaman side: a 2008 US diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks stated that ""Embassy vetting revealed no significant derogatory information"" about Rember Larios, who had just been appointed deputy police director at the time."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
"The Major Hurdles for Uruguays Marijuana Experiment. After months of delay, Uruguay is finally on the verge of becoming the first country to regulate every aspect of the black market for marijuana. Getting the marijuana regulation bill through Congress required pressure from civil society and considerable arm-twisting within the ruling Frente Amplio (FA) coalition, but the hardest part for the government is yet to come. On the evening of December 10, the FA majority in the Uruguayan Senate passed the bill to regulate marijuana in a 16 to 13 vote. President Jose Mujica will likely sign it into law before the end of the year, and authorities have said its implementation could begin as soon as April 2014. The measure will authorize cultivation for personal consumption of up to six plants per household, and commercial production of marijuana will be carried out by private entities licensed by the state. The commercially-grown marijuana will be sold in pharmacies to Uruguayan residents only, who can buy up to 40 grams per month. All of the above will be overseen by the Institute of Regulation and Control of Cannabis (IRCCA), and unauthorized forms of marijuana cultivation, distribution and sale will be penalized. Or at least, that is the plan. But even as the government moves forward with the measure, the future of marijuana regulation in Uruguay is murky. Polls suggest the majority ( 61 percent ) of the population remains against the bill, and opposition politicians have vowed to repeal it. With the political climate less than ideal, the government has been careful to frame the bill as an experiment. In a recent interview with Argentine news agency Telam , Mujica said he would not hesitate to ""turn back"" from the plan ""in case the reality shows us that we are wrong."" National Drug Secretary Julio Calzada, who heads the administration's drug policy agency, echoed this in a December 9 interview with EFE, although he was careful to add that future changes would not mean ""returning to the path"" of marijuana prohibition. If this test is to succeed, it will need to overcome a number of obstacles, both long- and short-term. While the short-term challenges are political threats to public confidence and the immediate goal of getting the bill up and running, the long-term obstacles will have the most impact on the country's historic experiment. The Short Term: Over the Next Year Public Opinion - This is by far the most over-hyped threat to the bill. While it is true that the majority of those polled say they are opposed to the initiative, the Frente Amplio has a proven ability to pass unpopular legislation without negative consequences. This was illustrated in June, when only 8.9 percent of the electorate participated in an opposition-organized vote to trigger a mandatory referendum on the FA's abortion decriminalization measure. Prior to the law's passage in October 2012, public opinion surveys suggested that 49 percent of Uruguayans opposed abortion decriminalization. A Cifra poll published ten days before the referendum, on June 13, showed that 51 percent of respondents said they would ""probably"" or ""definitely"" turn out in the vote. The fact that the turnout fell far short of this showed that polls are not always the best indicator of what the Uruguayan public deems politically acceptable. A Referendum - Despite the FA's success with abortion, opponents of marijuana legalization have vowed to organize a referendum on the issue. In order for them to do so, however, they will need to move quickly in the coming weeks to provide election officials with signatures from two percent of the electorate (roughly 52,000 people). If this is received, a preliminary vote on the measure would be convened within 45 days, as occurred with the abortion vote. If -- unlike abortion -- over 25 percent of the electorate participates in that vote, a mandatory referendum would be held within 45 days following primary elections on June 1. This means there is a chance that the marijuana regulation law could face a referendum in July 2014. Still, the odds of this happening are very slim, especially considering that opposition to the measure is relatively flexible. According to an October survey by local pollster Factum, the vast majority -- 78 percent -- of Uruguayans say they prefer users of marijuana to have access to the drug through the state, compared to just five percent who say they would prefer it to be sold on the illegal market. Election Season - Uruguay will hold general elections on October 26, 2014. This is the biggest risk to the law in the short term. Fortunately for drug reform advocates, opinion polls suggest that the Frente Amplio continues to hold an advantage over the two opposition parties. A Cifra voting intention survey published last month shows 44 percent for the FA, 27 percent for the National Party and 15 percent for the Colorado Party. Ex-President Tabare Vazquez, the likely winner of the FA's June 2014 primary, is the most popular politician in Uruguay. His victory in 2014 is all but guaranteed. The National Party's Jorge Larranaga, who will likely be Vazquez's main adversary, has already positioned himself against marijuana legalization, releasing a list of 20 reasons why he opposes the bill. Because public opinion is (at least superficially) on his side on the issue, Larranaga can only gain from using the bill to attack his opponent. This will raise pressure on Vazquez -- whose endorsement of marijuana regulation in August came as a surprise -- to distance himself from the initiative if it becomes a threat to his election. A Court Battle - A new threat to the bill emerged just as the Senate Health Committee was finalizing its hearings on the issue in late October. The opposition challenged its legality , invoking a constitutional ban on legislation creating newly-funded institutions one year before a general election. However, the government has maintained that it is within the bounds of the constitution, as it is in fact a private entity licensed to carry out certain public functions, like the National Institute of Seeds (INASE), an organization responsible for ensuring quality control and genetic variety of farming seeds in the country. Additionally, the opposition has claimed the addition to the bill of a requirement for drug awareness education in schools -- added to ensure the vote of holdout FA lawmakers in the lower house -- infringes upon the autonomy of the public education system. Even if neither of these arguments is successful in court, a high-profile legal battle would surely fuel public doubt about it, potentially creating an opening for its critics. Cracking Down on Unlicensed Growth - While widespread public opposition to the marijuana law is unlikely to result in its immediate repeal, this does not mean that Uruguayans will have endless patience for it if it is poorly implemented. There will be an incentive for the government to demonstrate zero tolerance for illicit cultivation, especially on a scale that amounts to trafficking. Because the IRCCA currently only exists on paper, it is still unclear how it will ensure that those who obtain home cultivation licenses stick to six plants per household. Will authorities carry out periodic checks? Will individuals be left to self-regulate? How strictly will those who violate IRCCA regulations be punished? These are all questions that are not answered in the text of the law, and will have to be determined by Uruguayan officials in the coming months. The Long Term: Over the Next Five Years Defining ""Success"" - Assuming that the Uruguayan government gets through all of the above, it will face the difficult challenge of presenting the bill to the public as a success. This is much easier said than done. Ever since Mujica first proposed marijuana legalization in June 2012, the government has framed the measure as a way to reverse rising insecurity and criminal activity in the country. While local human rights groups and drug policy reform advocates like the Regulacion Responsable coalition have also stressed the health and education benefits of marijuana regulation, the administration has stuck to its security-based narrative. Regulating the most widely-consumed illicit substance in the country, according to officials, would undercut a $20-$40 million per year black market, and the criminal groups profiting from it would take a big hit. But the public remains unconvinced by this argument (See Transnational Institute 's excellent breakdown of the workings of the law below). A July survey by Cifra found that just 27 percent of Uruguayans believe the bill would reduce the country's drug trafficking problem, compared to 33 percent who said it would stay the same and 31 percent who said it would increase. This means that if the government continues to frame the law as a blow to drug trafficking and crime, it will need the statistics to back it up. If homicides or other violent crimes actually increase, authorities will find themselves in an extremely awkward position. International Pressure - If the law is to remain in place, the government will have to find ways to justify it to the international community. Uruguay has already come under significant pressure to back away from legalizing marijuana from neighboring Brazil and Argentina , not to mention the UN International Narcotics Control Board , which sees it as a breach of Uruguay's international treaty obligations. While the international climate is easier now that two US states -- Washington and Colorado -- have legalized the drug as well, the bill will still invite criticism from the country which remains the biggest proponent of the ""war on drugs."" Finding a Balance - To properly regulate Uruguay's marijuana market, officials will have to strike a difficult balance. The state must make sure that enough is produced to satisfy domestic demand, while avoiding producing too much and having excess amounts of the drug in storage. Either a shortage or surplus or marijuana would invite censure from critics, who will no doubt be looking for any signs that the initiative is not having its intended effect. Additionally, the government will have to determine whether it will agree to demands from some marijuana activists for a cultivation model that incorporates economic development , or if it will involve only a handful of experienced growers that already have the capital and technology to produce the crop in a reliable, more traceable way. From a regulatory standpoint, the latter may be much easier to manage, although it could cost the government allies in civil society, as well as the FA's left-wing base. Setting a Price - The government will have to establish a price for the drug in pharmacies that somehow undercuts the black market and covers the operational costs for private growers at the same time. The initiative was also sold to the public as a potential source of revenue, and if the government has to subsidize marijuana cultivators' costs it will take a toll on the credibility of the law. While international and local press have breathlessly reported the $1 per gram price as a concrete fact, this is subject to change depending on future variables. Ultimately it will be up to the IRCCA to determine the final price, which will have to incorporate associated production and distribution costs. It will also have to resist political pressure to raise taxes to generate more revenue, which would boost the price and make it less competitive with Paraguayan marijuana. If Uruguay manages to implement the law successfully, it could have implications beyond its borders. After years as the main theater in the war on drugs, Latin America is emerging as the epicenter in the search for new alternatives. The 2012 Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, was a major turning point for the region. There, leaders like Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and Guatemala's Otto Perez Molina called for a regional debate on drug legalization and decriminalization. In the months and years since, decriminalization initiatives have gained traction in Colombia , Ecuador and Mexico. As alternative drug policies like these pick up steam around the region, policymakers will no doubt look to Uruguay's experience for guidance. In Mexico, where legislators are considering a bill that would open marijuana dispensaries in Mexico City, some are already talking about the ""Uruguayan model"" as a potential path forward. Ultimately, however, whether it is a cautionary tale or a definitive source of inspiration will depend on the government's ability to adopt a regulatory model that adequately meets the needs of Uruguay's market."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Narco-Tunnel on US-Mexico Border Points to Sinaloa Cartel. Authorities in Mexico and the United States have yet to identify who is behind the construction of a recently dismantled narco-tunnel near the US-Mexico border. But the location and high sophistication of the tunnel suggests the Sinaloa Cartel is responsible, providing further evidence of their status as one of the most powerful criminal organizations in the region. Agents from the US Border Patrol, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) have shut down an incomplete cross-border tunnel near the city of Jacumba in the state of California less than a mile north of the US-Mexico border, US Customs and Border Protection announced October 9. Mexican authorities originally discovered the 191-meter-long subterranean tunnel on September 19 at a house in the small town of Ejido Jacume, which sits just about two miles south of the US-Mexico border in Baja California state, after being tipped off by a citizen complaint, Zeta reported. The underground tunnel was highly innovative. It contained solar panels designed to run electrical, lighting and ventilation systems, in addition to having two sump pumps to drain the tunnel of any water that gathered inside. A rail system that stretched the entire length of the tunnel was also found inside. https://www.insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jacume_tunnel_1.mp4 (Video courtesy of US Customs and Border Patrol) US Customs and Border Patrol told InSight Crime in an email that the agency could not speculate on suspects potentially linked to the narco-tunnel. Authorities in Mexico have not yet identified any suspects possibly linked to the tunnel either. Tunnels have long been one of the more clever ways that organized crime groups in Mexico traffic drugs across the US-Mexico border. In April 2016, authorities discovered one of the longest narco-tunnels built between California and Mexico. It stretched some 800 meters and was equipped with an elevator. Organized crime groups have long shown their advanced engineering skills through the narco-tunnels they have used to traffic drugs into the United States. But the highly innovative nature and location of the recently dismantled tunnel suggests that the Sinaloa Cartel might be responsible for it. ""The Sinaloa Cartel is the principal builder of sophisticated tunnels,"" Mike Vigil, the DEA's former Chief of International Operations, told InSight Crime. Indeed, former Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias ""El Chapo"" -- who's been called the ""master of tunnels"" -- allegedly sent a team of tunnel engineers to Germany to receive specialized training needed to build the underground tunnel that El Chapo would later use to escape from a maximum security prison for the second time in 2015. Depending on the length, Vigil said that these highly sophisticated underground tunnels can cost between $1 million and $2 million. Traffickers can typically pay off these high costs after trafficking one single shipment of methamphetamine or cocaine, according to Vigil. ""The [narco-tunnels] are well worth their weight in gold,"" Vigil added. The Sinaloa Cartel certainly has the product needed to create such earnings. In August of this year, authorities in Mexico seized some 50 metric tons of methamphetamine -- likely the largest such seizure in Mexico's history -- allegedly linked to the criminal group."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Inaugurates Strategic Center to Fight Domestic Drug Trade. Mexico's Attorney General announced the creation of a new strategic center in Puebla state as part of a joint federal-state effort to fight domestic drug trafficking. At the announcement of the opening of the new ""Center for Strategic Operations"" on July 23, Attorney General Marisela Morales called ""micro-trafficking,"" or domestic drug sales, one of the country's gravest problems, due to the violence caused as gangs compete for control of the local market, reported El Universal. Speaking at a press conference alongside Governor Rafael Moreno Valle and other Puebla state officials, Morales highlighted the danger of drug addiction to working youth, students, and minors and warned that domestic drug sales and consumption are eroding Mexico's social fabric. The purpose of the new center in Puebla is to improve institutional cooperation among state and federal authorities. Specifically, the center will investigate where and what kinds of drugs are sold, the networks of distribution, and other "" crimes against health ."" Morales signalled the Attorney General Office's intention to create similar strategic centers throughout the country. While the number of drug users in Mexico remains relatively small compared to those of developed countries, especially the United States, domestic drug consumption has increased over the past decade. Mexico's most recent National Survey of Addiction , released in 2008, showed that consumption of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine has risen. In February, Mexican Health Secretary Jose Cordoba announced that Mexico has an estimated 450,000 hard drug users. Micro-trafficking also presents a growing challenge for the Mexican government due to its role in the changing nature of Mexico's criminal landscape. As Mexico's large drug trafficking organizations become increasingly fragmented , smaller gangs fight to control ""the corner"" (small territories) rather than ""the plaza"" (larger territories). Some analysts predict that as domestic drug consumption continues to rise, so will violence connected to micro-trafficking. So far Mexico's efforts to combat micro-trafficking show few signs of success. In August 2009, Mexico passed a law that legalized personal possession of small amounts of cocaine and marijuana, intended to target street-level dealers and cut down on the incarceration of drug users. However, as of January 2011, the number of people detained for drugs possession in Mexico's Federal District had increased 450 percent since 2002. According to a report by the Washington Office on Latin America, the law has done little to help curb prison overpopulation and eliminate major dealers: half of prisoners incarcerated for selling drugs in Mexico's Federal District were arrested for possessing less than $100 worth of narcotics.

"Argentina Police Possibly Involved in Upsurge of Kidnapping. Kidnappings rose by 50 percent in Argentina's Buenos Aires province between 2013 and 2014, a trend that appears to be fueled in part by the participation of corrupt active and former police officers. A total of 78 kidnappings were reported in Buenos Aires province in 2014, compared to 52 the year before, according to statistics from the provincial Attorney General's Office accessed by Clarin. Over the past two months, eight more kidnappings have been reported, at least three of which investigators believe were carried out by a sophisticated criminal group allegedly made up of current and former police officers. Meanwhile, six former federal police officers are currently on trial for allegedly running an extortion network in neighboring Cordoba province. The group -- which called itself ""The Millionaire Club"" -- allegedly threatened business owners with kidnappings and arbitrary detentions if they refused to pay monthly quotas. Both the former commissioner of the federal police delegation in Cordoba and his third in command are among the accused. The kidnapping figures provide some evidence of what has long appeared to be a growing problem in Argentina. However, these numbers likely fail to illustrate the full scope of the problem, as many kidnapping cases go unreported or are classified as another type of crime, according to Clarin. For example, kidnappings in Buenos Aires often begin as car robberies and morph into kidnappings if the perpetrators perceive the victim as being wealthy. These types of ""express"" kidnappings are therefore frequently reported by police as ""robberies followed by illegal deprivation of liberty"". The alleged participation of police in kidnappings further complicates this situation, increasing the risk of impunity, as police can use their law enforcement contacts to ensure crimes are not investigated or prosecuted. Criminals with a police background also have the ability to employ sophisticated tactics that decrease the probability of detection, as seen by a recent case in which a businessman was allegedly kidnapped by current and former police who forced him to remain barefoot in order to keep traces of their hideouts from ending up on his shoes. Other examples of alleged police participation in Argentine organized crime abound. A journalistic investigation conducted in 2014 revealed the alleged involvement of Buenos Aires police in burglaries and other criminal activities, while widespread corruption has forced provincial authorities to purge thousands of police officers in recent years. In addition, a large number of the individuals prosecuted for belonging to a drug trafficking organization known as Los Monos -- one of Argentina's most significant homegrown groups -- were police and members of other security forces. Security force involvement in kidnappings has been seen elsewhere in the region. In Colombia, a criminal network that sold hostages to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) included several current and former police officers. Similarly, a 2011 InSight Crime investigation in Venezuela found that up to 70 percent of kidnappings in Caracas were carried out by members of the now disbanded metropolitan police force."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

Despite Fears, Mexico Election Free of Major Drug Violence. Mexico 's presidential campaign has come and gone without any major acts of election violence, but this could simply be a sign that criminal influence on the vote has gone underground. On July 1, Mexico elected Enrique Pena Nieto to succeed Felipe Calderon when the presidency changes hands on December 1. In addition, voters replaced the members of both Congress chambers, and selected new governors in seven states. Despite fears of criminal violence marring the election day amid all this turnover, the process went smoothly, both on Sunday, and, for the most part, throughout the campaign. There were some provocative acts of violence (see InSight Crime's map ), but few could be clearly linked to organized crime and the elections. One of the few spectacular attacks in recent days -- a bomb attack on the Nuevo Laredo city hall , which injured seven -- occurred in a region where no elections were planned beyond the presidential race, so it's not clear that there was a political motive for the bombing. In another of the incidents making headlines, Marisol Mora, the mayor of a small town in Veracruz, was abducted from her home last week , and found dead in neighboring Oaxaca days later. She had worked on the campaign of government candidate Josefina Vazquez Mota, who finished in third place, but there is little to suggest that the attack was provoked by the election. Prior to election day, the government issued a map highlighting the regions with the most serious threats of campaign violence (see right). They had also promised to mount military patrols in some of the more turbulent regions , to discourage electoral manipulation. Whether or not it was because of these measures, the reports of criminal groups exerting influence on 2012's elections have been tamer than any other in Mexico's recent history. A handful of episodes over the past few years have fueled worries about attacks on the democratic process. In June 2010, weeks before an election for the governor's post in Tamaulipas, the leading candidate, Rodolfo Torre Cantu, was murdered in an incident most chalked up to one of the state's two main criminal groups, the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. In November 2011, reports emerged from Michoacan that members of the Caballeros Templarios gang had worked to boost the turnout for Fausto Vallejo, bringing about the surprise result: despite opinion polls that consistently put him several points behind his rival (and the president's sister) Luisa Maria Calderon, Vallejo pulled off a narrow victory. Why was this year's election spared these splashy attacks and examples of criminal manipulation? One explanation is, as InSight Crime noted in the aftermath of the Michoacan election, that presidential and congressional votes are less appealing targets for criminal groups than the gubernatorial contests that sparked the incidents mentioned above. Congressmen in Mexico are constitutionally limited to one term, so there are no influential political lions operating from the legislature, and they don't control police departments the way executive officials at every level do. A presidential election, in turn, is simply out of reach for most criminal groups. With more than 40 million voters, the absolute margins of victory are so large even in closely fought elections that affecting the outcome is difficult. In addition, while he controls any number of agencies whose support would be a major asset for organizations like the Zetas, the president is far less accessible than a governor, which makes the victory of one candidate rather than another less important to the gangs. Furthermore, the level of media attention discourages deals with criminals; should emissaries of one presidential candidate sit down with a group of capos, there is a much greater risk of being caught. Due to these factors, from the criminal's perspective, buying off the subordinates responsible for implementing security policy is a safer move than trying to influence the impact of a presidential contest through intimidation or bribes. Another, less optimistic explanation for the electoral season calm is that politicians are less inclined to resist the advances of criminal groups, so there is little need for acts of intimidation. Conversely, the criminal groups may have developed a better idea of how to surreptitiously put their thumb on the electoral scale. Rather than shooting candidates or leaving audio recordings revealing politicians' deals with rival gangs, criminal influence is wielded where it is most effective: beyond the reach of the public eye. While it doesn't result in public terror or acts of violence, such a scenario is far from good news for Mexico. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Layers of Corruption Facilitate Fuel Theft in Mexico. From corrupt oil workers to public officials to possibly even private companies, fuel theft from the Mexico's state-owned oil company Pemex has a lot of partners. Recent interviews with individuals involved in fuel theft published in different news outlets have shown the extent of this network. Speaking with Spanish daily El Pais , a former police officer turned ""huachicolero"" -- the term used to describe those who take part in fuel theft -- and a police chief explained the reasons behind the spike in the illegal practice observed in the past few years is directly related to this democratization of the trade. According to both, the ""milking"" of pipelines intensified after Pemex handed maps of the pipelines to local governments, in an effort to prevent explosions. But the maps ended up in the hands of criminal groups. ""At first we were helped by Pemex officers,"" said the huachicolero, adding that the company's employees showed criminals how to pierce through the pipelines. According to the police chief, a Pemex engineer who worked in his municipality charged criminal groups 25,000 pesos (an estimated $1,250) for every illegal fuel extraction he carried out on their behalf. In an interview with Mexican daily Milenio , an anonymous source involved in fuel theft said Pemex officers tell the huachicoleros the exact times when the fuel will pass through the pipelines, and provide them with the equipment necessary to extract it. But he also highlighted that these employees are just the first step in the corruption chain, which supposedly involves ""white-collar thugs."" ""[Corruption] involves public prosecutors, municipal authorities, state secretaries, and goes as far up as you can imagine,"" the source told Milenio, before adding that in his municipality huachicoleros must pay 10,000 pesos every month (an estimated $540) to the Federal Police in order to operate freely. Milenio highlighted that the corruption linked to fuel theft has also implicated the ex-public security secretary of state of Puebla Facundo Rosas Rosas, as well as various police officers and a mayor. And the newspaper said it has carried out an investigation since July 2016 on the alleged use of stolen fuel in the construction of an Audi plant in Puebla, which could implicate the leader of Mexico's powerful Workers Confederation (Confederacion de Trabajadores) union. El Universal reported May 25 that four mayors were under investigation by intelligence and judicial authorities. Several gasoline station owners are also under investigation, El Universal said. Fuel theft has long plagued Mexico, but according to the Financial Times the practice grew by 2,000 percent over the last decade, costing Pemex at least $1 billion per year. As InSight Crime reported at the beginning of the year, Pemex employees are key cogs in the fuel theft machine. Indeed, 123 Pemex employees and 12 former employees were arrested between 2006 and 2015 in connection with the activity. Nonetheless, very little is known about the corruption that takes place at the highest levels that helps oil this criminal operation. Earlier this month Proceso reported that the government was yet to design a plan to investigate Pemex's high-ranking officials, members of the Oil Workers Syndicate or authorities in the states where the fuel theft occurs. The magazine also questioned whether the criminal activity was used to finance political campaigns, as members of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional - PRI) claimed about the campaign of Puebla's former governor, Rafael Moreno Valle, a member of the National Action Party (Partido Accion Nacional). The trade of stolen fuel has also involved foreign companies. In the past few years, Pemex sued 23 US firms it accused of purchasing and distributing stolen Mexican fuel. The company, however, did not win any of these cases. As for local authorities, Alberto Islas, a founding partner of the Mexico City-based security consultancy Risk Evaluation, told InSight Crime the increase in revenues from sales of stolen fuel gives criminal groups more means to bribe officers and operate undisturbed. According to Islas, the authorities' complicity is ""fundamental"" for those taking part in the criminal activity. In addition to the layers of corrupt officials and businessmen, according to recent reports , there are two main criminal groups that are currently competing in the illegal trade. The oldest one is the so-called Bukanas, which has become a close to the Zetas. But in the last few years the group has been challenged by Antonio Martinez Fuentes, alias ""El Tonin,"" who has been linked to the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion - CJNG)."	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
"Mexico, US Fight Cross-Border Phone Trafficking. The United States and Mexico have signed an agreement aimed at preventing the cross-border trafficking of stolen cell phones, smart phones and tablet computers. AFP reports that the Mexican Secretariat of Communications and Transport and the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have agreed to share a database of stolen phones in order to block their reactivation, thus nulling the value of these electronic appliances on the black market. About 40 percent of all robberies in New York, Washington and other US cities involve cell phones, an although there are no offiicial estimates, it is believed that some of the devices wind up in Latin American markets, including Mexico. According to FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, the agreement acts as a strong disincentive to would-be transnational phone traffickers. ""US and Mexican collaboration to block reactivation of stolen mobile devices in both countries sends a clear message to thieves and criminal gangs: This is a crime that does not pay,"" Genachowski said. While the extent of organized crime's involvement in phone trafficking is likely limited, Mexican authorities say there appears to be a link between phone trafficking and crimes like extortion and kidnapping. This is not the first case of a coordinated approach to phone theft between countries. In response to increasing mobile phone robberies worldwide, government representatives from the United States, Turkey, Spain, Ecuador, Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile and Colombia met in Bogota on October 12 to agree to monitor the transnational trafficking of stolen phones more closely, laying the foundation for further cooperation in the future. Some countries are responding to the problem of phone theft by introducing strict penalties for those who commit the crime. In Guatemala, for instance, the legislature is debating a bill introduced in June which would mandate prison sentences of up to eight years for an individual convicted of activating a stolen phone."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"CICIG: Guatemala Faces Challenge of Structural Corruption. The head of an internationally supported anti-corruption body says Guatemala is facing a problem of ""structural corruption,"" suggesting that allegations of widespread graft in the country's previous presidential administration are anything but isolated incidents. Ivan Velasquez, head of the United Nations-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG), made the comments in a June 6 interview with the radio program ""A Primera Hora."" Velasquez spoke about the charges brought last week against former Guatemalan president Otto Perez Molina and former Vice President Roxana Baldetti, which accuse the pair of accepting illegal campaign contributions to help them win the 2011 election. Once in office, they allegedly returned the illicit favors by awarding public works contracts to donors. Perez Molina and Baldetti are currently jailed on corruption charges related to a tax-evasion and bribery scheme known as "" La Linea ."" Perez Molina is also accused of accepting bribes from a Spanish company in exchange for steering a major port development contract toward that firm. According to Velasquez, whose organization supported these investigations, the problem of corruption in Guatemala is not limited to Perez Molina and Baldetti's Patriot Party. Rather, he said, ""it is a corruption that is much more rooted to the point that it could be, hypothetically, that these consolidated structures have remained in the country [and] in the government, and can even reach relationships and understandings with each government, for cyclical corruption."" Velasquez made similar comments in a June 6 interview with German news outlet Deutsche Welle. ""There is no evidence to suggest that the corrupt structures have been dismantled,"" he said. A source in CICIG who asked not to be identified told InSight Crime that it would take time to address the systemic corruption in Guatemala. The source, who said he was not authorized to speak publicly, called campaign finance ""the original sin,"" adding that once politicians have taken the money they have to find a way to repay their benefactor. ""In this way you substitute the public interest for the interests of certain elites who finance the campaign,"" the source said. Echoing some of Velasquez's comments, the CICIG source also said the cases that have been brought with the anti-corruption body's support ""shine a light on the problem, but they don't solve the whole problem."" ""The system of corruption is so profound, with deep roots, that it does not depend on any one case or any one person,"" the source said. ""It can change, adapt with great speed."" Guatemala ranked 123 out of 167 countries in Transparency International's 2015 Corruption Perceptions Index survey. The only countries in the Americas that scored worse were Venezuela, Haiti, Paraguay and Nicaragua. "	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Soldiers on Honduras Streets Provides Preview of Security Strategy. Honduras' newly sworn in president has deployed military police and a new police unit into the streets of capital Tegucigalpa, in a move that could be a sign of his promised hardline approach to security. During the January 27 inauguration ceremony, President Juan Orlando Hernandez put the plan -- named ""Operation Morazan"" -- into effect and declared his intent to use ""mano dura"" (iron first) policies to combat violence and insecurity in the country, reported La Prensa. The operation will see the Military Police of Public Order (PMOP) and the ""Tigers"" -- a specialized police unit created to combat organized crime that went operational on January 26 -- deployed on the streets of Tegucigalpa and the adjoining city of Comayaguela to fight crime. Hernandez said that ""any policy established in Honduras to combat insecurity must have the fundamental goal of fighting against drugs, drug trafficking, organized crime, money laundering, and, thus, zero tolerance."" His strategy will include increasing both the military and police presence on the streets and on public transport, he said. Minister of Security Arturo Corrales also pledged to reduce the homicide rate to seven murders per day -- from the 17 or more witnessed currently -- while Hernandez promised to decrease violence and extortion in the crime-wracked country in coming months. Hernandez's immediate deployment of soldiers as police onto the streets serves as a potential preview of the security policies his administration will employ while in office. Hernandez has been an active proponent of militarized security and was influential in the creation of the PMOP. The new president's security views have raised concerns among those who believe these kinds of iron-fist policies run contrary to civil liberties and human rights. Evidence also suggests that, rather than quashing crime, ""mano dura"" policies in Latin America can serve to increase violence and strengthen gangs. Honduras, as the world's most dangerous nation outside a war zone, has a particularly challenging security situation. It has a high concentration of the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) street gangs, who are deeply involved in criminality and exert social control. It has also seen a sharp increase in drug flights since 2009, accompanied by an influx of transnational criminal groups. The country is also faced with severely weak institutions and a police force rife with corruption and organized crime links. The previous administration began militarizing security partly as a way of mitigating the current police crisis, exacerbated by a stuttering reform effort. However, in addition to human rights concerns, this strategy has had little effect thus far and fails to address the institutional weaknesses underlying Honduras' security crisis."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Guilty Verdict in Berta Caceres Murder Trial in Honduras is Partial Justice. Authorities in Honduras found seven of the eight men accused in the high-profile murder of renowned environmental activist Berta Caceres guilty, a welcomed step forward, but justice was only partially served. Prosecutors found seven of the defendants, Sergio Ramon Rodriguez, an engineer for Desarrollos Energeticos SA (DESA); Douglas Geovanny Bustillo, DESA's former head of security and a retired military officer; Mariano Diaz Chavez, a former soldier who served with Bustillo; Henry Javier Hernandez, a former Honduran soldier who served with Diaz; Edwin Rapalo, former Honduran soldier Edilson Duarte Meza, and Oscar Torres guilty of Caceres' murder, the Attorney General's Office announced November 29. The eighth defendant, Emerson Duarte Meza, was found not guilty due to insufficient evidence against him and released. Hernandez, Rapalo, Edilson Duarte and Torres were found guilty of the attempted murder of Mexican environmentalist Gustavo Castro. The verdict comes more than two years after armed gunmen burst into Caceres' home in La Esperanza in southwest Honduras on March 2, 2016, killing her and wounding Castro, who survived only because he played dead. (Graphic showing Caceres' murder scene c/o International Expert Advisory Panel report ) In 2015, Caceres, who founded the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (Consejo Civico de Organizaciones Populares e Indigenas de Honduras - COPINH), was awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize for her activism. Caceres' staunch opposition to the construction of the Agua Zarca hydroelectric dam managed by DESA, which threatened to jeopardize indigenous Lenca communities living along the Gualcarque River that they consider sacred, is believed to be what ultimately led to her murder. Authorities in Honduras first arrested Rodriguez and Bustillo, as well as two others, in connection to the murder in May 2016. By January 2017, they had arrested Hernandez, Rodriguez and Atilio Duarte, in addition to two of the other defendants. In March 2018, authorities arrested Roberto David Castillo Mejia, DESA's executive director at the time of Caceres murder. It's unclear when he will stand trial. The owners of DESA, the powerful Atala Zablah family, have not been charged with any crimes and deny any involvement in the murder. Caceres' eldest daughter, Olivia Zuniga, told the Guardian that the family is ""glad to see jailed the killers who murdered my mother,"" adding that they demand ""the masterminds behind the murder be brought to justice."" Robert Amsterdam, the international counsel to DESA who is representing Rodriguez, rejected the court's guilty verdict and said he will appeal the ruling. ""There is no question that this trial was the subject of an overwhelming international pressure campaign based on false claims, and now it has produced its desired result - a politically motivated farce to imprison an innocent man despite a lack of evidence,"" he said in a statement. The defendants could receive up to 30 years in jail for Caceres' murder and between 20 and 30 years for Castro's attempted murder. Sentencing is scheduled for January 10, 2019. The convictions in Berta Caceres case are, although imperfect, historic. The fact that nearly all of those identified as material authors of the murder were arrested, tried and convicted for their crimes is a historic step for a country that has struggled to improve the investigative and prosecutorial capacity of its institutions in recent years. This was no easy task and could serve as a stepping stone for future prosecutions. Successful convictions in these types of cases almost never happen in Honduras and in Latin America more broadly, which is one of the deadliest regions in the world for environmental activists. A 2017 Global Witness report found that the killings of environmental defenders ""rarely result in prosecutions."" However, there is still a long road ahead to achieving justice. The guilty verdict in the most high-profile murder case authorities in Honduras have arguably ever seen was welcomed, but predictably it did not satisfy all of the victims' families or international observers , who argue that there were serious prosecutorial issues and that authorities failed to reveal the full truth or hold all of those involved in the crime accountable. ""Since the beginning of this process, almost three years ago, it has been clear that the murder of Berta Caceres was planned by the executives of DESA and then executed by hired assassins linked to the armed forces of Honduras,"" COPINH said in a statement. The murder investigation was marred by controversy long before the trial began. Incredibly, two vehicles stopped an appellate court judge in October 2016 and robbed her of the case file that she had taken from her office to further analyze at home. In addition, a separate investigation conducted by an independent group of experts found that the existing evidence is ""conclusive regarding the participation of numerous state agents, high-ranking executives and employees of DESA in the planning, execution, and cover-up of the assassination."" Castillo Mejia, who is awaiting trial, is the only alleged intellectual author of the crime to be arrested so far. The trial itself was also filled with irregularities and roadblocks. The murder trial was delayed from the start, for example, after the private lawyers representing Caceres' family accused the judges presiding over the case of abuse of authority and a cover-up. Then, just before the trial began, judges ousted them, leaving the victims' families with a public prosecutor. Despite the case's clear flaws and holes, and the many structural issues that Honduras' justice system must still confront, the guilty verdict is a step forward towards ensuring complete justice is served. The next test will come during the trial of former DESA executive director Castillo Mejia -- who was the alleged mastermind of Caceres' murder. The Caceres case illustrated the potential of the justice system in Honduras to secure convictions. But the larger question is whether this was just an isolated resolution made possible by the immense national and international pressure the case received. It remains to be seen if the justice system can function effectively without the eyes of the world fixated on it.

"Guatemalan Foreign Minister Calls for Historic Dialogue on Alternative Strategies in War on Drugs. In an interview with El Espectador, Foreign Minister Luis Fernando Carrera explained Guatemala's plan to facilitate a ""historic dialogue"" for new strategies in the fight against drug trafficking at the meeting of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States this July. Guatemala, a country suffering high homicide rates as a result of drug trafficking, wants to further the discussion on alternative strategies in the war on drugs that was initially raised in Cartagena, during the Summit of the Americas, under the auspices of President Juan Manuel Santos. In July Guatemala will host the General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS), attended by chancellors from all over the continent, and there are hopes to achieve a ""historic dialogue"" that will give a new twist to the approaches used to combat drugs. Chancellor Luis Fernando Carrera, an Oxford academic, was in Washington to present before the OAS a specific agenda to discuss, one that will bring about a conversation on thorny issues for countries like the United States, such as the legalization of some crops and the decriminalization of consumption. Carrera spoke to El Espectador about his proposal, and about what he hopes to achieve at the OAS summit. What was it that you came to present to the OAS? We are going to host the General Assembly of the OAS from June 6-8 in Antigua, Guatemala, and as is customary the host presents the main theme [for the assembly] to the Permanent Council, which then decides whether it is in agreement or not. Since the CELAC summit we had already raised the idea to the secretary general that we were interested in discussing as the principal theme ""alternative strategies to fight drugs,"" and that we would present that theme with various subtopics in order to better specify what we were talking about. And so that is what we did in the session of the permanent council and they very graciously considered them. What are the subtopics? Strengthening the public health system for prevention and addiction. Reducing homicides and crimes connected to drug traffickingPromotion of local economic development and legalization of crops. Reduction of arms trafficking and of money laundering. And a fifth subtopic, decriminalization of consumption or of certain aspects of consumption, to reduce the incarcerated population. It stands out that reducing trafficking isn't specifically addressed. Well one supposes that with this focus we can reduce consumption and channel part of the production towards the legal economy, and through that, achieve less trafficking. And the important matter is reducing the damage that trafficking does in terms of violence. It's a matter of how to combine the strategies. Traditionally it has been said that what must be done is ""law enforcement,"" application of the law, and that is what was called the war on drugs. Which is a punitive focus on trafficking, on production, and in general a violent response by the state towards the cartels. This, what has been done in Latin America, has increased the violence, and because of that we are a continent with so much violence, with so many homicides. What we're trying to find is a different focus, more humane, more preventive, more oriented towards trying to reduce violence, and through this way we will succeed in reducing consumption and production. But above all reducing the human cost that drug trafficking is producing, which has resulted in enormous violence. An effective policy against drugs such as you all imagine, could mean that trafficking remains the same but that violence falls. Yes, the violence and the damage to human health that drugs provoke. Having a greater focus on public health and prevention of violence, rather than on the promotion of violence to reduce trafficking. At this moment the existing strategies are very centered around combating direct trafficking by using the security forces and criminal prosecutions. That doesn't mean abandoning the fight against criminal networks. Because the state should fight to have control of our territory. That is an inalienable duty for every state. But we want to do that in a context in which there are fewer deaths and more prevention for addicts. All of this is laid out in the framework of a discussion. A number of countries, such as Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico, have taken the initiative and have raised the idea that the [existing] strategy is a failure. But the United States maintains that it is successHow do we move beyond the discussion? In the United States there also exist various narratives, even within the government. Last year Gil Kerlikowske, White House Anti-Drug Czar, was in Guatemala. He has a very similar perspective to what I just mentioned to you. In fact when we presented these proposals to the US Ambassador in Tegucigalpa, he said that he would have to give more visibility to Kerlikowske, so similar was his perspective. But the emphasis in practice, in Latin America, has been the war against drug trafficking and production In practice that has been the emphasis. But that hasn't been the whole narrative. And it's important to highlight that, because there are sectors in the Obama administration which say that we need a discussion about a revision of strategies. Not to abandon the head-on fight, which is something we can endorse, we're not interested in the criminals being the owners of countries. But yes emphasizing things that haven't been emphasized. What's necessary is a different combination of strategies But in the real application of policies, given that there are limited resources, when one puts more emphasis on one side, that takes away from the other. You propose to get rid of the emphasis on interdiction and production, and move towards an emphasis on violence. That is to say, take police and military off the task of interdiction and have them looking for murderers. That's an example. But let me put forward another example to you. The fiscal effort to keep drugs from reaching the United States takes resources away from the state for addressing the grave problem of infant malnutrition. It takes away resources from the education of Guatemalans. It takes away resources from programs for production incentives. From the public health system. The issue is that the strategy of keeping drugs from reaching the United States takes resources away from you. Today a North American official asked me if we need more assistance for drug interdiction. And I said it would be very welcome because frankly it hurts us to take resources away from other parts of the state. And frankly we don't have a reason to be taking resources we could be using to reduce malnutrition in Guatemala and using them so that at last no shipment of drugs will reach the USA. A shipment which gets there because of consumption and demand, not because we're stimulating trafficking and production. That is to say you would like to let drugs get through and deal with other matters? It's more than letting drugs pass through. Yes, we're going to control the flow of drugs. Rather it's that there would be fewer drugs, because there would be less consumption, and, on the other side, that the drug control we are doing would have more resources. Because [currently] we are spending resources on a problem that is not in Guatemala. It's to solve a problem that is multilateral, because we are geographically located in the middle of countries that are massive producers and countries that are massive consumers. And with regards to the idea that we are all producers and consumers, please, that doesn't stand up to any statistic. There are countries that produce more and countries that consumer more, and we aren't one or the other. You say that the dialogue at the OAS General Assembly meeting in Antigua will be historic. Why? Because we will be able to discuss these types of strategies at the government level. These matters have been discussed at the NGO level. At the government level, no. We're going to lay out the foundations for a new dialogue and new alternatives for the fight against drugs. We're not going to abandon the fight against drugs, but rather understand how to better combat them. These five topics have never been discussed, not even in Cartagena. For the first time the USA is sitting down to discuss alternatives, with the understanding that there are new alternatives. At the end of the meeting, the idea is to give the OAS a mandate so that the Secretary General can lead a high-level dialogue to reform the fight against drugs and achieve a different balance. If we do that and we do it well, it will be historic. If in the western hemisphere we find a different way to fight drugs, then we will provide a lesson for the world. After meeting with the State Department and the White House, what is your feeling on how the USA sees this discussion? What concerns them the most is the possibility of Antigua turning into a circus of anti-American complaints. And we are in agreement that a lot of anti-Americanism doesn't bring us any solutions. We are in agreement, and we have promised that the political climate will be high level. And we will play a role as head of the assembly to achieve that. Did you all touch on the matter of marijuana legalization in the US? No, we didn't discuss it. We still understand that it's an internal matter for them. The discussion on drugs is being laid out as a multilateral matter. In our bilateral relationship we have said that we will fulfill all our agreements. From the beginning, the debate is a debate for all the countries in the hemisphere. Is there concern in Guatemala about becoming a producing country? The concern is there, such as with synthetic drug labs and poppy cultivation. But if you're just growing in Northern Guatemala, that isn't going to be enough to provide drugs to massive markets. If [the current strategy] stays on track, if alternatives aren't accepted, if this discussion doesn't go anywhere, what will Guatemala do? If there's not much progress in the international dialogue, we have the responsibility to our population to reduce the violence, strengthen the emphasis on prevention and public health, and use resources to focus on our priorities. And we aren't going to focus all our resources, but we are going to accept them in the context of our fiscal possibilities. Ultimately you hit on a fiscal matter, and I understand it as a fiscal problem. We would have to return to a position of unilateralism, which is a focus on violence, on prevention. *Pacheco is a columnist at El Espectador.

"Rio Police Chief Steps Down, As City Steps Up Security. The resignation of Rio de Janeiro's police chief in the wake of the murder of a judge, allegedly carried out by men under his command, demonstrates a firmer stance against corruption in the force, writes blogger Julia Michaels. Three strikes, and Rio's military police commander Mario Sergio Duarte was out: Caso Juan -- June 2011 shooting death of a young boy, initially covered up by four police perpetrators, who were later arrested Bribery scandal in pacified favelas of the Santa Teresa neighborhood, discovered earlier this month, leading to the investigation of 30 cops and a change in command August 2011 assassination of Judge Patricia Acioli and the ensuing arrest this week of Complexo da Mare Battalion Commander Claudio Luiz Oliveira , the alleged mastermind behind the ambush carried out by five or six other cops, apparently in retribution for Acioli's anti-militia actions in the Sao Goncalo bedroom community next to Rio de Janeiro. Oliveira led the Sao Goncalo battalion at the time of the judge's death. The new military police chief is Colonel Erir Ribeiro da Costa Filho , who most recently headed up Rio's newly-upgraded 190 emergency telephone number operation. He has experience in the militia-ridden West Zone of Rio, as well as in Sao Cristovao. Costa Filho has a history of whistle-blowing within the military police and in the case of at least one government official. At a press conference, the new commander said that the military police's internal affairs division will have to become proactive, and that the force's leaders must set an example. ""The police academy doesn't teach a person dignity,"" he added. ""Dignity comes from the cradle, from the person himself."" State Public Safety Secretary Jose Mariano Beltrame said he wants police to present their annual tax declarations. The state's response to all three strikes listed above and Duarte's resignation itself indicate a firm stance -- with laudable transparency and accountability -- against police corruption and crimes. In the wake of Oliveira's arrest, Duarte turned in his resignation from the hospital where he underwent a prostate operation this past Monday. This morning he gave a telling radio interview (not available online, unfortunately) from his hospital bed. Duarte told interviewer Ricardo Boechat that he quit because he believes he holds ultimate responsibility, having assigned Oliveira to Sao Goncalo. Boechat asked how Duarte came to make that assignment, knowing that the commander was under investigation for earlier wrongdoing, although not indicted. ""As careful as we are in making choices, weighing all the data, there will always be a chance of error, even if the officer has a completely clean record, "" Duarte answered. ""Colonel Claudio was the third commander under me in Sao Goncalo and he was bringing down the crime rate. But the process of selecting commanders is very difficult. What is inadmissible is to say later 'I didn't know, I didn't see, I was betrayed.' The responsibility is mine."" Duarte also said that military police may have behaved in a particular fashion in the environment that encouraged police violence, before the new public safety policy was implemented in 2008. Now, they have a chance to change -- and he believed in giving the men and women under his command that chance. Implicit in his words is the fact that Rio's police force, largely underpaid, simply doesn't have enough manpower prepared for the new public safety environment. To learn about what state public safety secretary is doing about police attitudes and behavior, set to be implemented early next year, read this earlier post.

"Power Plays in Medellin as Crime Lord Killed in Venezuela. With an alleged heir to the Medellin mafia found dead, dumped outside a Venezuela hospital, it may be that Urabenos, a criminal group poised to take over the city, are eliminating their rivals. Carlos Esneider Quintero Galvis, alias ""Gomelo,"" was left outside an emergency room in Maracaibo on February 6, with gunshot wounds to the head and no identification. His parents came to Venezuela five days later to identify the body. Police identified Quintero as the new leader of a faction of the Medellin mafia, known as the Oficina de Envigado. He was one of the 20 most wanted criminals in the Medellin area, and police offered a 250 million peso (about $140,000) reward in return for information on his whereabouts. The Oficina was founded by Pablo Escobar, and later commanded by paramilitary leader Diego Murillo, alias ""Don Berna."" After Murillo was extradited in 2008, the Oficina split into rival factions. One was controlled by Maximiliano Bonilla Orozco, alias "" Valenciano ,"" who was arrested in Venezuela last year and extradited to the US. Another faction is headed by Erick Vargas, alias "" Sebastian. "" Bonilla was reportedly a mentor to Quintero, who became a member of one of Medellin's street gangs at age 11, according to El Colombiano. Quintero's first introduction to criminal life was robbing victims as they withdrew cash from ATM machines, a practice known in Colombia as ""fleteo."" Quintero rose through the ranks of the underworld until he became the leader of one of Medellin's oldest street gangs, the Mondongueros. This was one of the most powerful gangs who supported Bonilla in his war for control of Medellin, and became his shock troops in a block-by-block war for control of the city. Bonilla and Quintero worked for a faction of the Oficina de Envigado which controlled international cocaine export routes, shipping the drugs from Medellin to the coastal cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena. Their primary rival, Vargas, fought fiercely for control of the city's drug trade, and for extortion payments made by the city's casinos, brothels, transportation companies, and other businesses. After US authorities put a $5 million reward on his head, Bonilla went to lie low in Venezuela. According to police intelligence, Quintero may have provided authorities with the information that eventually led to Bonilla's arrest, El Colombiano reports. It is not clear why Quintero was in Venezuela, but he may have fled after receiving threats from Bonilla's allies, looking to take revenge on the suspected informant. The other possibility is that Quintero was killed on the order of the Urabenos, a powerful paramilitary group interest in taking over Medellin's criminal operations. The Urabenos, whose stronghold is along the Caribbean coast, have had a foothold in the city since late 2010. Since Bonilla's arrest, the Urabenos have expanded into neighborhoods previously controlled by the Oficina, including parts of Comuna 13, Belen, Aguas Frias and Altavista. The leader of the Urabenos' faction in Medellin, Henry de Jesus Lopez Lodono, alias "" Mi Sangre ,"" is a native son of the city and is expanding the Urabenos' control there. A neighborhood that has remained immune from the Urabenos' influence so far is Medellin's Comuna 5, Quintero's stronghold and the traditional stomping ground of his street gang, the Mondongueros. Unlike many of Medellin's often short-lived gangs, or ""combos,"" the Mondongueros have survived on the streets for over two decades. They first formed in Comuna 5 in 1990, and have built up a strong base of support there, with families who have supplied generations of gang members. With Quintero gone, the Mondongueros may enter a new period of flux. The group is currently embroiled in another gang war for control of Medellin's sister city, Bello. This could leave their stronghold, Comuna 5, particularly vunerable to the entry of the Urabenos. For the Urabenos, Quintero's death opens up a new strategic opportunity; for the Mondongueros, the timing could not have been worse. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Why Kidnapping, Extortion Boomed in Mexico. By turning to kidnapping and extortion, the fragmented remains of Mexico's drug cartels found a new way to support themselves without focusing on transnational drug trafficking. That's why the future of Mexican organized crime isn't someone like El Chapo -- it's splinter groups like the Guerreros Unidos. Twenty years ago , to be a mafioso in Mexico meant being a drug trafficker. Here there was no ""organized crime,"" only ""narco."" Kidnappers, extortionists and bandits existed, of course, just as they always have, but they played on a different field. The criminal big leagues were taken up by gangs dedicated to moving drugs, crossing borders and dodging customs agents. They were sophisticated, identifiable, connected to the world, and had the ability to put even an anti-drug czar on their payroll. This article was originally published by El Daily Post and is republished with permission. It is the latest installment in a journalism project called NarcoData, developed by Animal Politico and Poderopedia, which seeks to explain the evolution and growth of organized crime in Mexico. See the original here. But such a Tigres del Norte scenario started to change in the '90s. The business became decidedly more complicated. Besides the usual marijuana and heroin, cocaine began to arrive in industrial quantities and methamphetamine came into the picture. The change brought with it two problems. First, the entire issue became more public, making government tolerance more difficult. The publicity problem was exacerbated by the American government issuing certifications every year, and even more so as the Kiki Camarena case stayed in the rearview mirror. The spotlight demanded that one capo or another had to fall from time to time, and one shipment or another had to end up in the Federal Attorney General's Office's warehouses. Second, and probably more important, internal control grew more difficult for the narco leaders. More drugs moving means more drugs to steal. Inevitably, more than one gang member felt the temptation to slip a hand into a package, or to tip off a rival (for a price) as to where a shipment was heading, or where a warehouse was located. Mexico's smuggling wizards were gradually pushed aside by the violence specialists. The result was a growing militarization of the drug trafficking groups. As is well known, the pioneer of this strategy was Osiel Cardenas Guillen, head honcho of the Gulf Cartel. Toward the end of the '90s, he recruited elite military personnel -- the Zetas -- and turned them into his Praetorian Guard. Soon, other gangs followed suit: Sinaloa with its Gente Nueva, Juarez with La Linea, the Beltran Leyva Cartel with its Negros and its Pelones, and its FEDA (Spanish initials for Arturo's Special Forces, Arturo being the first name Beltran Leyva usually used). That strategy not only escalated the conflict between rival drug traffickers, it also changed the balance of power within the individual organizations. The smuggling wizards were gradually pushed aside by the violence specialists. The latter, now-dominant, soon figured out that drug trafficking opened up other criminal opportunities. There they were with plenty of men, weapons, vehicles, safe houses and bought-off authorities -- why not take advantage of all that and get into kidnapping? Or extortion first targeting other criminals, then the public at large? After all, the marginal costs were zero. What's more, it was a good way to reduce labor costs: Payment to the hired killers could be kept at a minimum by instead giving them permission to kidnap, extort and steal (always with a cut for the higher-ups, of course). So toward the end of the Vicente Fox administration (2000-2006), what had once been gangs specializing in drug trafficking had turned into diversified criminal consortiums. Some of the gangs, such as the then-newly formed Familia Michoacana, born out of a split in the Gulf Cartel, were already more involved with plunder than with illicit merchandise. We still have the giant cartels, dedicated to drug-trafficking and plugged into the international markets. But they represent organized crime's past in Mexico. That development exacerbated the organizations' visibility problem; secrecy is not much of an option when you're out there extorting every day. Worse, it changed the relationship between the crime organizations and the communities -- tolerance and indifference turned into calls for help. Eventually, as Calderon moved out of the presidency in December of 2012, the new business logic triggered a government intervention marked by a hitherto unseen ferocity. Violence took off, capos began to fall, and lieutenants felt they were ready to take over as capos. The once hierarchical and identifiable organizations began to break into thousands of pieces. From the Beltran Leyva organization emerged at least seven groups , nine from the Zetas and a dozen from the Gulf Cartel. Those new organizations -- which were really more like splinter groups, though they presumed sometimes to call themselves cartels -- possessed neither the international contacts nor the logistical sophistication to carry out major drug trafficking operations. But they did have weapons, men and a strong inclination toward violence. And toward extortion, as mentioned. And toward kidnapping. And stealing. And denuding hillsides with illegal logging. And looting mines. And anything else that generates cold, hard cash. When pillage becomes a business, local politics is suddenly the center of attention. Municipal government became an irreplaceable source of information: Who's in charge of what? Who wants to start a new business? Who applied for a building permit, or a license, or a whatever? To keep on thinking in terms of cartels and smuggling routes is to live in the past. What matters today, what will matter tomorrow, are gangs and turf and extracting income. Local government also turned out to be a convenient supplier of muscle. Why hire assassins if you already have the local police at your beck and call? Mayors, for their part, had the option of being accomplices or prisoners of the gunmen. Plata o plomo. Silver or lead. Or both, in grim succession. However, when criminals take over the daily lives of ordinary citizens, unexpected sources of courage sometimes pop up. In some places, most dramatically in Michoacan, residents abandoned those useless calls for help in favor of armed resistance. And yes, here and there they actually defeated the criminals and recovered a semblance of peace. In other cases, though, the informal forces of justice ended up turning into what they were supposedly fighting against -- that is, delinquent groups no different than the previously existing crime organizations. So here we are. We still have the giant cartels, dedicated to drug-trafficking and plugged into the international markets. El Chapo is still there, so are El Mayo and El Mencho. But they represent organized crime's past in Mexico. The future is Guerreros Unidos and Los Rojos. The future is H3 and the Metros and the Viagras. The future is all the other groups that are something more than local gangs and something less than cartels -- local in scope, diversified, and more interested in exploiting local economies than in supplying foreign consumers with drugs (though some also go that route). This transition is both good and bad. The good: The emerging groups are going after mayors and local police forces, not the State. They have neither the motive nor the means to bribe a drug czar or corrupt half the SEIDO (the Federal Attorney General's Office anti-organized crime division). They are not, nor can they be, a threat to the integrity, stability and permanence of the State. They don't play in that league. The bad: The emerging groups are a permanent, everyday threat to the life, liberty, dignity and property of millions of Mexicans. The are also a threat to what little State presence there is to be found in many regions -- that is, the municipal governments. If the risks today are more like leeches than mammoths, some deep thought is called for about the most effective way to contain them. The Army, Navy and Federal Police are very good at catching capos (though keeping them in prison is apparently another matter). But they may not be the best tool for dealing with small-time extortion, with short-term abduction, and with looting at the municipal level. What's probably needed for those things is, first of all, a professional, well-paid police force at the local level, working closely with the community. Second, there need to be prosecutors who really seek justice, who know how to build a case, who can dismantle an entire criminal ring with one well-aimed blow. Is that a lot to ask? Perhaps. But it's what reality dictates. To keep on thinking in terms of cartels and smuggling routes is to live in the past. What matters today, what will matter tomorrow, are gangs and turf and extracting income. That's how it needs to be understood. That's how it needs to be taken care of it. And soon.

"Could it Be that the Venezuela Murder Rate Did Peak in 2008?As Interior Minister Miguel Rodriguez Torres and the Venezuelan Violence Observatory battle it out over the 2013 murder figures, most Venezuelans shrug their shoulders and believe who they want to believe. Government supporters instinctively trust the minister, while the opposition takes it for granted that the Observatory's much higher estimate must be right. Oddly, in this hyperpolarized environment , the quality of that Venezuelan Violence Observatory (OVV) number has not gotten much scrutiny -- and the OVV figure is not what it seems. It is not a body count based on leaked government data, nor is it an estimate constructed from a proprietary survey. It is a forecast based on past trends -- a slightly more sophisticated version of the XKCD method. This article first appeared on the Caracas Chronicles blog. Read the original here. In fact, the methodology section of OVV's latest press release raises more questions than it answers. The forecasting techniques they mention require data both on past forecasts -- i.e., 2010's guess for 2011 -- and on actual realized past values -- i.e., the actual number of violent deaths in 2011. But since, by OVV's own account, they don't have access to reliable counts for at least the past five years, it is not clear what they're using as model inputs. There is an oblique reference to ""partial data from diverse regional and national sources,"" but it's not clear what those data are or how they are used. I reached out to Roberto Briceno Leon for clarification [disclosure: Briceno Leon is a friend and I had him read a draft of this post before publishing], hoping to be told, ""No, chama, you misunderstood; our number is based on data from such-and-such source."" Nope. Instead, he said that my methodological criticisms were valid, adding, ""Our methodology isn't perfect, and it doesn't meet all the standards, but there is no other way to get information in this darkness -- this is the little light we have."" In other words: without reliable government statistics, what do you want from us except a simple forecast? Well, let's see: for starters, I'd like OVV to publish rather than hide the accuracy (or lack thereof) of their estimate. For instance, they tell us that ""we can state the range of our affirmations with a 95 percent confidence level,"" but this does not really make any sense, because they are not publishing a range, they are publishing a number! That point estimate without a confidence interval is close to meaningless. Are they 95 percent sure that the interval 75/100,000 to 83/100,000 contains the true homicide rate? Or are they 95% sure that it is between 20/100,000 and 138/100,000? For all we know, the government's figure -- 39/100,000 -- is within OVV's range. Then they compound the problem by reporting what they have already told us is an estimate with extreme numerical precision -- 24,763 deaths, rather than 24,762 or 24,764 -- lending the figure an artificial air of exactitude. Not amusing. And there is a further methodological pastiche that has to do with the inconsistent use of ""homicides"" and ""violent deaths,"" which look like synonyms but definitely are not. (For instance, if you're killed resisting arrest, that doesn't count as a murder for Rodriguez Torres' purposes.) OVV used to report homicides , but their 2013 press release actually refers to violent deaths. So we end up with a case of apples and oranges: OVV's 2013 (and 2012) estimates are not directly comparable to OVV estimates from previous years or to Rodriguez Torres' number. These flubs are troubling because OVV insistently bills itself as an academic institution, which gives their estimates a scientific aura. That press release refers to ""investigators from the seven national universities that make up the Venezuelan Violence Observatory,"" and Briceno-Leon is a respected and prolific professional sociologist. But claims to scientific status depend crucially on publishing detailed descriptions of methodology, allowing other researchers to scrutinize and replicate results. Why does OVV not do this? And, if OVV is wrong, what's the real story? Surely, we cannot just trust the minister's number: with even less information about how Rodriguez Torres's people arrived at their figure (insert obligatory condemnation of CICPC censorship), that would be foolhardy. So is there any reason -- other than Rodriguez Torres's say-so -- to believe that the worst of the violence nightmare might actually be behind us? In fact, I see three reasons to suspect that the answer might be yes and none of them have to do with Plan Patria Segura. First, little noted in the Guerra de Cifras (War of Statistics), there actually is a third source of info on all this: the Ministry of Health (MPPS), which compiles and publishes birth and death records. And, perhaps surprisingly, the MPPS data show the violent death rate falling in 2009, 2010, and 2011 (the last available year; 2012 and 2013 haven't been posted yet). Of course, MPPS officials might have manipulated the data for political reasons -- but if they did, they did so carefully, without leaving obvious tracks in the underlying micro data (which I have worked with for research purposes). Naturally, there is a lot of room for error -- and potential bias -- in the way MPPS codes the death certificates that give rise to this data. Still, much of the administrative process is separate from the process that produces the CICPC data, which makes it better than nothing as a third source. Moreover, there is not an obvious basis to fudge it, since this data is so far off the political radar screen. But let's assume you just refuse to take any number the government publishes seriously on principle. Then are we stuck with the XKCD method? Not at all. Rather than forecast the homicide rate based exclusively on the past trend -- which, for OVV, is itself a series of rough guesses -- you might try estimating the homicide rate based on hypothesized covariates. Roberto Briceno-Leon, for example, has made quite clear that he views impunity as a key driver of the violent crime trend; he might therefore try to look at data on policing or apprehension rates. Or take Quico's hypothesis, which is that the volume of cocaine trafficked through Venezuela drives the homicide rate -- not, as in Mexico, because cartels fight for the international trafficking business ( Venezuela has only one big cartel ), but because some of the cocaine makes its way to the domestic market, where street gangs fight for the local retail trade. If you believe this story, you might note that trafficking has declined as demand in the United States falls , and that could account for lower violence in Venezuela. Other research links homicide rates to childhood lead exposure, pointing to evidence that the decline in leaded gasoline use in the United States in the 1970s produced the decline in US homicide rates in the 1990s. This is yet another reason that Venezuela's homicide rate might be declining: the childhood lead exposure of Venezuela's malandreable-age** cohort rose sharply through the 1990s (as crime increased) and then recently began to drop. My point isn't that either lead poisoning or cocaine trafficking is definitely responsible for the violence wave; these assertions would require serious quantitative evidence. My point is that there are lots of data researchers consider when trying to explain trends in homicide rates. Longstanding trends can turn, sometimes for reasons that have nothing to do with law enforcement. But no new trends could show up in an OVV estimate that limits itself to extrapolating data from years when murder rates were rising. Actually, it's not even clear why they needed to wait until December to publish their 2013 number: if all the data that went into their 2013 estimate was data they already had a year ago, why not publish the 2013 murder tally back then? For that matter, why not tell us right away how many homicides there will have been in 2014? So now that I've tugged OVV's ear for methodological opacity, I better tell you where I got all my data: Official/CICPC/MPPRIJ figures were published here by Ana Maria San Juan, for 1990-2011. For 2012 and 2013, I am taking the official homicide rate from press reports on official announcements ( 2012 , 2013 ). MPPS publishes annual reports here. For 1999-2010, I am calculating the violent death rate based on the underlying data, but you can replicate the totals using just the data in the PDFs (which is what I do for 2011, since I don't have that micro data yet) by adding the following causes of death (ICD-10 codes): X85-Y09, Y20, Y21, Y22, Y23, Y24, Y28, Y29, Y30, W32, W34, Y35, Y36. For population, I am using some INE data that I think has been removed from their website; happy to provide it by email. For cocaine seizures, 2007-2011 are here ; 1980-2006 here. Childhood lead exposure is a back-of-the-envelope calculation: the product of road gasoline sold per capita ( from WDI ), percent of population that is urban (also WDI), and percent of road gasoline that's unleaded (see p. 76 here ). *Dorothy Kronick is a PHD candidate researching violence in Venezuela. ** ""Malandro"" is a Venezuelan term for a ""thug,"" typically a male under 25 years old.

June Most Violent Month of 2016 in Caracas: Report. June was the most violent month of the year in Caracas, according to a new report, but specific security trends in Venezuela remain clouded in uncertainty due to a lack of official crime statistics. A total of 500 bodies were sent to the Bello Monte morgue in Caracas last month, the highest figure of any so far in 2016, reported El Nacional. The morgue received 2,827 bodies during the first six months of the year, an 8 percent increase from the first semester of 2015. Some 80 percent of the deaths were the result of homicides, while 20 percent were due to traffic accidents, according to El Nacional. In addition to civilians, increased violence is being directed at Venezuela's security forces. In early June, the Foundation for Due Process (Fundacion para el Debido Proceso - Fundepro ) reported 163 military officials, police officers and bodyguards had been killed during the first five months of 2016, or 14 percent more than in the same period last year. El Nacional's report suggests violence is rising in Venezuela's capital as the country's overall outlook continues to worsen. Venezuela is teetering on the verge of economic collapse, and the political situation has grown increasingly contentious as the opposition attempts to depose President Nicolas Maduro from power via a recall referendum. Venezuela's security situation is also looking increasingly dire. Already considered one of the most violent countries in Latin America, the Attorney General's Office registered a 47 percent increase in homicides during the first three months of 2016 compared to the same time period in 2014. The government did not release homicide figures for the first trimester of 2015. And in mid-June, the University of Santa Maria in Caracas reported that the number of kidnapping cases nationwide has increased by 170 percent in 2016. The data, however, is far from conclusive. The number of violent deaths in Caracas, for example, include non-criminal and unintentional incidents such as car accidents. The statistics in the kidnapping report, meanwhile, were based on anecdotal evidence and perceptions. Obtaining accurate crime statistics is a major challenge for countries across the region, but in Venezuela the problem is amplified by political indifference to improving the quality of the data sets. In the past government officials have admitted to refraining from publishing crime statistics, while more recently a report surfaced illustrating how difficult it is for researchers to gain a clear understanding of the country's violent death rate, let alone its homicide rate.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"What Are Guatemala Presidential Candidates Planning on Security?Guatemala will head to the polls on June 16 to elect a new president, a decision that is sure to have profound implications for the nation's domestic security, as well as regional stability in Latin America. So far, this year's campaign season has been marred by controversy and efforts to upend the electoral process. In April, US prosecutors charged presidential candidate Mario Amilcar Estrada Orellana with soliciting Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel for campaign funds and their services in assassinating his political rivals. Then, Guatemala's Constitutional Court barred the two candidates widely believed to be the top contenders in the race from running for president. Zury Rios -- the daughter of the late former army general and dictator Efrain Rios Montt -- was banned from running in May due to an article of the constitution that bans relatives of those who ""came to power by coup or force"" from running for president. Montt became president after a military coup in 1982. Former Attorney General Thelma Aldana was ruled ineligible to run for president shortly after Rios due to trumped up corruption charges. The anti-corruption crusader was thought to be the clear favorite in the election. Her removal paved the way for other candidates to climb up the polls. Below, InSight Crime looks at the four top contenders for president of Guatemala. Sandra Torres -- UNE Sandra Torres, the current frontrunner in the polls is running for president for the third time on behalf of the National Unity of Hope (Unidad Nacional de la Esperanza -- UNE), one of Guatemala's oldest political parties and that of her ex-husband, former President Alvaro Colom. The Attorney General's Office and International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG) investigated Torres and the UNE in 2015 for alleged illicit campaign financing during her unsuccessful bid for the presidency. She ultimately lost to outgoing President Jimmy Morales, who the CICIG is also probing for allegedly receiving campaign funds from illicit sources. That said, Torres has vowed to clean house to rid the country's institutions of the corruption that has overcome them. ""From the first day of management I am going to sweep the government of all the corruption that is embedded today,"" Prensa Libre reported her saying in May. However, Torres hasn't offered up a solid anti-corruption plan, only going so far as to say that she would focus on an ""austerity plan"" in order to establish an ""open, efficient and transparent"" government. She would leave the future of the CICIG up to a public referendum. Torres' own alleged corruption links, coupled with her affiliation with one of Guatemala's most entrenched political parties, suggest that her fight to curtail graft could be more lip service than action. What's more, an April poll found that nearly half of voters said they would never vote for her , implying that a share of the population doesn't have faith in established political systems continuing apace. As for dealing with the country's gangs and the grip they hold over the prison system, Torres has proposed ""comprehensive"" prison reform that doesn't focus on root causes, but instead on isolating prisoners in jails located well outside of the city and blocking cell signals in an effort to hamper communications and criminal activity. ""With these resources we can build [new prisons], take them out of the urban area, isolate them and put an end to extortion,"" Torres told Prensa Libre in June. Torres makes no mention, however, of addressing the pervasive prison corruption that allows inmates to carry on committing crimes from behind bars. The UNE's presidential candidate has also pledged to increase inter-institutional coordination, and modernize and increase the technological and investigative capacities of a national police force in serious need of an extensive overhaul. She also plans to temporarily militarize sectors of the city with high rates of criminal activity. Torres is widely believed to be the favorite to win the elections, but her proposals to combat corruption, insecurity and crime suggest that little innovation would come with her as president. Roberto Arzu -- PAN-Podemos Presidential hopeful Roberto Arzu has little political experience, but he's cut from the same cloth as Guatemala's conservative elite class. He is the son of the late former President and Guatemala City Mayor Alvaro Arzu, and will be running with the PAN-Podemos (National Advancement Party -- Partido de Avanzada Nacional (PAN) & Podemos) coalition political party. So far, Arzu has taken a hard line on his plans to improve security and squash the country's criminal groups, much like his father before him did. ""There are 16,000 soldiers in military bases that cost Guatemala more than 2 billion quetzales [around $260 million], and instead of having them there we are going to take them to the streets to provide security,"" Arzu told Publinews in May. Arzu has also proposed militarizing the country's prisons, reforming and professionalizing the national police force, and upping the number of officers to 60,000. He argues that this will give criminals captured by authorities two choices: ""either surrender or die."" Such strategies are out of touch and show that Arzu doesn't fully grasp the root causes of some of Guatemala's security issues. This militarized approach -- like others that have failed elsewhere in the region -- won't have any lasting positive impact on insecurity or weaken the control that criminal groups wield. Any short-term gains will almost surely be just that, temporary, and with little long-term impact. As for anti-corruption efforts, Arzu has stressed that the CICIG will cease to exist after its mandate expires in September 2019, although he's failed to offer up a concrete plan for when the commission departs. Arzu himself protested against the United Nations-backed anti-graft body and supported President Morales' decision to oust the commission's former head, Colombian prosecutor Ivan Velasquez. This was one part of a broader effort by Morales and other elites to walk back significant progress the country had made on anti-corruption efforts. While the CICIG helped strengthen the capacity of the Attorney General's Office, powerful networks of entrenched elites have struck back at them, suggesting that local institutions alone won't be enough to meaningfully combat corruption. This could be exacerbated with Arzu as president. ""The CICIG was a good project with good intentions, but badly managed by the people who started playing ideological politics and wanted to manipulate the electoral processes, attacking even the rule of law,"" Arzu said. An Arzu presidency would almost certainly mean a significant step back for Guatemala's anti-graft drive and a continuation of outdated security measures that have proven ineffective in years past. Alejandro Giammattei -- Vamos A lifelong politician, Alejandro Giammattei is running for president for a fourth time on behalf of the Vamos political party after unsuccessfully campaigning for president in 2007, 2011 and 2015, each time with a different party. He was also a candidate for mayor of the capital Guatemala City in 1999 and 2003, but also came up short. His 2019 candidacy initially seemed doomed to fail, but the barring of Aldana and Rios from running has given him a boost that has placed him in second place, according to some recent polls. Giammattei's vague security proposals revolve around the recovery of the prison system as a way to combat crime and the country's criminal groups. The presidential hopeful has also ruled out the continuation of an independent anti-graft body like the CICIG. Over the years, he's been a dark spot in a political system accused for years of abusing authority and outright corruption. Indeed, between 2006 and 2008 when Giammattei was the director of Guatemala's prison system, two of the worst prison massacres to take place in the last decade shocked the country. In September 2006, police forces stormed the Pavon prison in hopes of taking back control but instead executed seven inmates in the process. Giammattei was arrested in 2010 for his role in the events, but he was later acquitted in 2011. The following year, in February 2007, four policemen accused of murdering three Salvadoran congressmen and their driver that same month were murdered in the El Boqueron prison. Investigations by the CICIG and Attorney General's Office pointed out that a police death squad had murdered the officers. As the head of Guatemala's prison system at the time, Giammattei testified in favor of one of the police chiefs prosecuted. He said that the entire investigation had been a ""fabrication,"" which was never proven to be true. However, Giammattei's questionable prison record isn't the only cause for concern. Another point that weighs against Giammattei is his relationship with Ingmar Walterio Iten Rodriguez , a shadowy political operator the Attorney General's Office accuses of managing bribes paid to Guatemala's tax administration to expedite tax refund payments to private companies. Iten may have also been a partial financier of Giammattei's 2011 presidential run, according to an investigation by El Periodico. Edmond Mulet -- Humanist Party Edmond Mulet is a career diplomat and politician. He is running on behalf of the Humanist Party (Partido Humanista) in the upcoming election. At the start of this decade, Mulet was the Chief of Staff to former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon before he was appointed as the Special Representative and Head of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti in 2011, a position he held until 2015. In the 1990s, Mulet served as Guatemala's ambassador in Washington, DC, and after that as the Central American nation's ambassador before the European Union. Mulet was also a congressman in Guatemala before he served as president of Congress from 1992 to 1993. Before his time as a diplomat and politician, Mulet was alleged to have been part of an illegal adoption network in which foreigners adopted Guatemalan children. As a young lawyer in the 1980s, Mulet is alleged to have ""sidestepped legal controls"" that guaranteed the protection of minors, according to a Plaza Publica investigation. He was arrested, but the charges -- which he denies -- were ultimately dropped and he never stood trial. In Mulet's proposed government plan , his security strategy accounts for just two of the more than 30 total pages. This is despite his clear recognition of the need for ""profound change"" in this area. The presidential hopeful proposes restructuring and elevating the investigative capacity of the national police force in the hopes of being able to better combat the country's criminal groups, primarily gangs like the MS13 and Barrio 18, which rely heavily on extorting the local population. In an effort to better combat drug trafficking, Mulet's is proposing to strengthen the presence of security forces in areas where the state has been ""weak or non-existent,"" primarily the porous border regions with Mexico to the north and west, and with El Salvador and Honduras to the south and east. Such lawless regions are perfect for drug trafficking , as well as other crimes like the trafficking of prized natural resources and animals. Mulet also hopes to increase the efficiency of Guatemala's prison system, in part by building ""modern"" maximum security prisons in the center of the country to prevent high-profile criminals from escaping. Overall, Mulet's platform doesn't offer much in the way of serious proposals to improve security and combat corruption, both of which are pressing concerns for voters."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"The Unbearable Solitude of Honduras Attorney General. Honduras Attorney General Oscar Chinchilla was elected by congress in September 2013, in a controversial process driven largely by the interests of the ruling National Party. But Chinchilla has altered the agenda and found himself between competing powers, leaving him on a political island. On September 9, 2016, the son of Luis Alonso Valle Valle was captured by Honduran authorities and charged with the murder of three people in the Copan province in northwestern Honduras. The accused was a minor, so they did not release his name, but his father was a well-known criminal figure in the area. Luis Alonso, along with his brother, Miguel Arnulfo, had been extradited to the United States to face drug trafficking charges in December 2014. Their sister, Digna, was already in a US jail when they arrived, also facing drug trafficking charges. Miguel Arnulfo's daughter, Yosari, was still in Copan, as was Luis Alonso's son, who, according to investigators, telephoned Yosari to give her a play-by-play of the gruesome massacre of a woman and two brothers. The authorities recorded this call and others, and mounted an operation that led to the capture of Luis Alonso's son. With the intercepts in hand and the accused adolescent assassin in custody, the Attorney General's Office thought it had struck another blow against the vaunted criminal groups of Honduras. Since taking office in September 2013, Attorney General Oscar Chinchilla had made a habit of targeting these organizations. Chinchilla's office assisted with the capture of the Valle Valle brothers , as well as that of Carlos ""El Negro"" Lobo and Hector Emilio Fernandez Rosa, alias ""Don H."" All of these figures have since been extradited to face trial in the United States. However, Chinchilla's efforts have also hit roadblocks, and often he has shouldered the blame. Such was the case with the son of Luis Alonso Valle Valle. In a surprise decision, the judicial branch moved the case to a judge in the area that handled cases of minors. The new judge refused to admit the wiretaps , archived the case, and released the son. The Attorney General's Office protested the decision, but to little avail. Although authorities have since issued another arrest warrant , Luis Alonso Valle Valle's son remains at large. The incident was one of many over the last year that made clear just how isolated the Attorney General's Office has become in its fight against corruption, impunity and organized crime in Honduras. In spite of strong backing from the international community, Chinchilla and his colleagues have been bearing the brunt of the battle against organized crime and corruption, and shouldering the blame when anything goes wrong. Critics come mostly from the entrenched political elites who have for years systematically impoverished the judicial system and used it for their own purposes, but Chinchilla's enemies are not limited to these rivals. Civil society groups are livid over the prosecutor's handling of the high-profile murder of the environmental activist Berta Caceres, and international watchdog groups wonder if Chinchilla is a presidential stooge. A Presidential Pawn? When he was picked to be attorney general in 2013, Chinchilla's critics feared he would be President Juan Orlando Hernandez's pawn. Chinchilla was the only magistrate to survive a congressional purge of the Supreme Court in 2012, which was led by then Congressional President Juan Orlando Hernandez. The purge of the court was a precursor of the battles to come. It centered on efforts to administer polygraphs and other ""confidence"" tests to the police, so that officials could purge their own ranks. The police and their allies lost the fight, as did four of the five magistrates. (To this day, Chinchilla is still squabbling with the police over his support for these type of tests.) At the time, support from Congressional President Hernandez, who was already revving his engines to run for president, was hardly a guarantee for later success. On September 1, 2013, Chinchilla secured congressional support with just 90 votes -- 71 of which came from Hernandez's National Party -- only 4 votes over what he needed to get the super-majority and become attorney general. But the vote was plagued by accusations of political manipulation. The previous attorney general had been forced from his post early, and some politicians wanted Chinchilla to simply serve out the remainder of the previous prosecutor's term. Despite skepticism, Chinchilla got off to a fast start. On September 19, just weeks after he took control of the prosecutor's office, the Attorney General's Office assisted in the government's seizure of upwards of $500 million in properties and possessions of the Rivera Maradiaga family, the core of the feared Cachiros criminal group. The Cachiros were a powerful underworld family that coordinated drug trafficking to and from Honduras, and whose political, economic, and social power touched all circles of society in Honduras, including the son of former President Porfirio Lobo, a longtime National Party strongman, and possibly Ramon Lobo, the former president's brother. In March 2014, authorities arrested El Negro Lobo. In August and September 2014, after Digna Valle Valle was arrested in the United States, the Valle Valle brothers and several of their associates were arrested. In October, Don H was arrested. These suspects were all later extradited to the United States, but the arrests led to increasing seizures of assets in Honduras. Property seizures went up ten-fold between 2013 and 2015, according to the Attorney General's Office. These led to threats. Chinchilla's own family received a series of death threats, for instance, after an operative was deployed to seize the assets and property of the Valle Valle drug trafficking organization. These were hardly idle matters. The former head of the financial crimes unit, Orlan Arturo Chavez, had been assassinated in April 2013. Chinchilla also began to upend the official support networks that had long protected these drug trafficking networks. Shortly after he took control, he restructured the Directorate of the Fight Against Drug Trafficking (Direccion de Lucha Contra el Narcotrafico - DLCN) within the Attorney General's Office after that it was connected to a case that involved millions of dollars smuggled into Panama. Chinchilla later added 38 prosecutors to the anti-corruption unit and designated another 24 from a newly created special unit -- the Technical Agency for Criminal Investigation (Agencia Tecnica de Investigacion Criminal - ATIC) -- to work on corruption cases. By 2015, the number of cases of public official corruption had doubled, including cases against 3 judges and 42 police, the Attorney General's Office reported. The cases had huge political implications, but Chinchilla seemed unfazed and increasingly critical of the politicians and judicial authorities who facilitated criminal activities. ""The drug traffickers who we have seized properties from, who we have taken to prison and others who we have extradited, they weren't born a month after we took over the Attorney General's Office,"" he told the press. ""They have been here for 20 years, which leads me to ask myself: Why didn't anyone notice they were doing this before?"" Targeting Elites? In November 2013, Hernandez won the presidency, but his hand-picked attorney general was already on the loose. In addition to the moves to corral high level drug trafficking suspects and to reform his own office, Chinchilla pushed hard an ongoing investigation into the Honduras Social Security Institute (Instituto Hondureno de Seguridad Social - IHSS). The IHSS is one of the largest government agencies in Honduras, with medicine, construction and transport contracts with various service providers across the country. The movement of government money and contracts has long made these types of institutes a ripe place for corruption in places like El Salvador and Guatemala. The IHSS was no different than its counterparts, and by late 2013, the Attorney General's Office was investigating widespread allegations of fraud, misuse of funds and corruption. In April 2014 , Chinchilla's office charged Mario Zelaya, the head of the IHSS between 2010 - 2014, along with several others with corruption, money laundering and numerous other crimes. Zelaya fled but was captured in September 2014. President Hernandez praised his functionaries for the capture -- mostly the military police -- but the case was a time bomb for him and his National Party. Zelaya was a party operative who, although he was a one-time supporter of Hernandez's rival campaign, had worked with the party since 2005, and was a close associate of former President Porfirio Lobo. Eventually, the case spread from Zelaya to other parts of the IHSS. The investigations ranged from kickbacks to unauthorized travel to campaign contributions, which allegedly went into the coffers of the National Party during the 2013 presidential campaign. In total, there are 29 different cases; the various embezzlement schemes cost the government an estimated $330 million. After a strong initial push, however, the case has dragged through the system, and the rumblings and threats around it have increased. In May 2015, the lead prosecutor fled the country due to threats, further delaying the investigations. There have been more than 15 convictions in IHSS-related cases, and Zelaya has been sentenced for a parallel case of arms trafficking. Still, his IHSS-related case has not gone to court yet, and other cases against top-level participants are also languishing in the system. The critiques have followed. ""The Honduran attorney general, Oscar Chinchilla, has so far failed to investigate or prosecute National Party leaders in the diversion of health care funds to party accounts,"" guest columnist Alexander Main noted in a New York Times editorial from February 2016, entitled "" An Anti-corruption Charade in Honduras ."" Purging the Police The IHSS case is one of many that critics say illustrate Chinchilla's window dressing, his inability to finish what he started. These critics note that the biggest cases are not even driven by Chinchilla. In October 2015, for instance, the US Department of Justice charged four members of the powerful Rosenthal clan of money laundering and other corruption-related charges. Three of the four accused are in the US to face the charges. Chinchilla's office followed this by seizing numerous Rosenthal assets. But no criminal charges have been filed against the family patriarch, Jaime Rosenthal, who is the last remaining person on the US indictment still in Honduras. Other powerful cases against elites are also in motion but moving slowly. The Attorney General's Office under Chinchilla has arrested 12 mayors who are under investigation for crimes ranging from money laundering to corruption to murder, several of them from Hernandez's National Party. However, of those 12 only Arnaldo Urbina Soto, the former mayor of Yoro, has been been sentenced; he was convicted of money laundering on February 27, 2017. Some of the most notable of the cases are the murders of former drug czar Julian Aristides Gonzalez and Alfredo Landaverde. But while the initial boom in press coverage served to launch a special police commission, the cases themselves appear to be terribly flawed. The efforts to purge and prosecute the police have placed Chinchilla and the Attorney General's Office in an impossible political position and illustrate, in part, why he is in such a tenuous spot now. The president's loyalties lie with the military. He was schooled in a military school. His brother and close adviser is a colonel in the military, and he has placed numerous members of the army into traditionally civilian-held posts. And as a means to fill the security gap presented by the police's chronic corruption and ineptitude, President Hernandez deployed the military police. He also tried, and failed , to codify the military police into the country's constitution. To the police, Chinchilla is seen as Hernandez's attack dog. As part of the aforementioned case against the former officers, for example, Chinchilla's prosecutors raided a police unit and excavated files. The police struck back: when Chinchilla sent prosecutors on a raid against a drug trafficker in cars without license plates, the police stopped their vehicles and later justified the decision by saying they were obliged to stop cars without plates. Berta Caceres and a Paltry Budget On the afternoon of September 29, 2016, a Honduran appellate court judge piled Berta Caceres' case file into her bag, got into her car and started home. On her way, her car was cut off by another vehicle. Armed men piled out, hijacked the judge's car and the case file, and sped off. Although the theft of the file was clearly the court system's responsibility, the suspicious act -- which has since elicited any number of conspiracy theories -- dropped like a bomb on Chinchilla's office. The Caceres' murder case had already greatly eroded the substantial capital that the Attorney General's Office had built up under Chinchilla. After her murder, prosecutors had arrested six suspects (they have since arrested two more), including an active and a retired member of the military and a manager of the Agua Zarca energy company. But the case has nearly roiled US-Honduras relations. Some US congressmen were calling for a halt to Honduran aid until the case was resolved to their satisfaction. Just what satisfaction meant in this instance is not known. Civil society groups want the attorney general to charge and arrest the owners of the company that was developing the dam that Caceres and others had blocked with their protests. Those owners are part of one of the wealthiest families in the country, who are also staunch supporters of Hernandez and the National Party. Furthermore, leaked court documents recently accessed by The Guardian show that the murder may have been planned by military intelligence specialists who received training in the United States. As it was with the police, the Caceres case put Chinchilla squarely between numerous power brokers: in this case it was the president and his powerful backers on the one side, and the United States, civil society groups and activists on the other. And, although the attorney general insists that the case continues apace, a group of international lawyers have launched a parallel inquiry. The impact has been devastating on a political and a financial level. The Attorney General's Office current budget of $71 million is the lowest in the region. In the last decade, Honduras has allocated more than 115 billion lempiras (about $5 billion) to the country's security and justice systems, of which the judicial system has gotten 17.3 percent and the Attorney General's Office only 9.3 percent. In comparison, the Security Ministry has received 36.2 percent and the Defense Ministry 37.2 percent. The deficit is apparent in other ways as well. An ATIC pilot project allowed for 50 prosecutors in San Pedro Sula and 50 in Tegucigalpa. In contrast, the newly minted Investigative Police Directorate (DPI), a special unit created six months after the ATIC, began with 1,000 agents and had an initial outlay of 200 million lempiras (about $8.5 million). In 2016, Chinchilla, along with several civil society organizations, called for an increase of 580 million lempiras (roughly $25 million) for the Attorney General's Office budget, which would be earmarked for the hiring of at least 400 new prosecutors, 400 investigative agents, 100 forensic doctors and another 100 financial crime analysts. Instead, the presidency asked congress for an increase of 29 million lempiras ($1.23 million). As the Alliance for Peace and Justice (Alianza por la Paz y Justicia - APJ ), a group of civil society and religious organizations working for justice reform, recently pointed out , ""In order to continue demanding results from the different special prosecutors' offices, criminal investigation agencies, forensic medicine units and other units of the Attorney General's Office, it is necessary to equip them with sufficient human, logistical and financial resources."" Chinchilla's current political isolation may also be worsening. He reportedly does not always attend the executive branch's National Security Council meetings. And when he does, he does not always sign in, preferring rather to be a spectator. Chinchilla's term goes until 2018, but he may not make it that long. One of the most recent drug trafficking cases headed by the Attorney General's Office involves the so-called Atlantic Cartel, a disparate network connected to army officials, judges and others. When faced down by US interrogators, one of those accused of facilitating the cartel's activities said President Hernandez's brother, a congressman for the National Party, was involved. Hernandez's brother denied the claims, but a US official at the embassy told InSight Crime that he remains a "" person of interest ."" *This article is part of an ongoing series on judicial and police reform in Honduras."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Capture of Levi Felicio on the Brazil-Paraguay Border Raises Uncertainties. The recent arrest of a purported Brazilian criminal gang boss, as well as a number of collaborators, including police, along the Brazil-Paraguay border has revealed a complicated problem: nobody knows who is working for whom. During an operation on October 14, Paraguayan authorities captured Levi Adriani Felicio, who allegedly maintained links to top Brazilian gangs, the First Capital Command ( Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC ) and the Red Command ( Comando Vermelho - CV ), along the strategic border between the states of Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil and Amambay in Paraguay. Four other individuals were also detained during the operation, in the capital of the Paraguayan state, Pedro Juan Caballero. Among those arrested were Marcio Gayoso, alias ""Candonga,"" who is reported to be Felicio's right-hand man, according to a report by the newspaper La Nacion. SEE ALSO : Police Links to Drug Trafficking Endemic in Paraguay During a press conference, Paraguay's anti-drug trafficking prosecutor, Marco Alcaraz, stated that Felicio coordinated the logistics for drugs and weapons supplied to the First Capital Command ( Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC ). But another official mentioned that Felicio may have also had links to the Red Command ( Comando Vermelho - CV ). The day following his arrest, on October 15, Felicio was deported to Brazil, where he faces trial on a number of criminal charges, news outlet Ultima Hora reported. A few days later, on October 29, Paraguayan authorities arrested 21 police officers, including several police chiefs from across the state of Amambay. They are accused of collaborating with Felicio's criminal gang, providing them with intelligence, facilitating criminal activities in border cities, and even operating as hitmen for the drug gang, Ultima Hora reported. Conflicting accounts by Paraguayan authorities concerning associations between Levi Adriani Felicio and Brazilian criminal groups seem to reflect that he was an unusually successful freelancer, providing drugs, weapons and contraband to a range of customers, including deadly rivals like the PCC and CV. For while the PCC has managed to position itself as the strongest criminal actor along the border region, other more fluid and independent structures still control much of this territory. A senior-ranking officer from Paraguay's highway police told InSight Crime that the PCC is seeking to establish hegemony over the northern part of the border, which sees cocaine trafficked from Bolivia enter Brazil as well as tons of marijuana and contraband goods from Paraguay. The CV, meanwhile, has greater control over the southern region, from where it controls the trafficking of marijuana and smuggling of contraband that supplies market demand in Rio de Janeiro, said Bruno Maciel, a spokesperson for the federal police of Ponta Pora in Brazil. SEE ALSO : Paraguay News and Profiles But in addition to this already complex panorama, local groups such as Felicio's or the Clan Rotela have operated in the region for decades, moving drugs and contraband alike. Gone are the times when renowned criminal leaders, like Jorge Rafaat - killed in 2016 by a consortium of criminal groups - or the so-called Pavao Clan , dictated all criminal activities on the disputed border. Today, while the PCC is on the ascendancy as a transnational criminal group, it must still contend with a wide range of smaller, local groups which continue to dictate much of the criminal panorama in Paraguay."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Canary Islands Convenient Haven for Drug Trafficking, Money Laundering. An international drug trafficking network used an often-overlooked set of Spanish islands as a crucial thoroughfare along a key drug transit route for traffickers to capture the European market. A total of 11 Spanish nationals and one Colombian national awaiting extradition to Spain were arrested to culminate the two year investigation, according to a January 23 Europol press release. Officials also seized more than $2 million in assets from the group. Coordinated by the Colombian intermediary in Cali just southwest of the capital Bogota, drug loads departed the South American nation and transited through the Canary Islands off the coast of West Africa before reaching other members of the network in Spain, who were in charge of distribution, according to Europol. The shipments were disguised in caravans traveling from the Canary Islands to Spain, as well as in mobile homes. The network ""owned vehicle dealerships, auto repair shops and managed long-term caravan parks"" in order to conceal transport of the vehicles, while also using the businesses as a cover to launder money, according to authorities. Among the millions in assets that Spanish police seized were a variety of vehicles and homes that were listed in the names of suspected frontmen, according to a January 23 press release from the agency. This is not the only recent drug operation to center around the Canary Islands. In May of 2019, authorities jailed seven individuals caught on board a fishing vessel in waters near the islands who were transporting 1.5 metric tons of cocaine from Brazil to Spain, reported Spanish press agency EFE. The Canary Islands make a convenient transshipment point for Colombian cocaine to reach European shores, as drug gangs seek ever more ways to reach this lucrative market. But this latest operation suggests that the Canary Islands does not only provide an ideal transshipment point, but also a base for laundering dirty money. The investigation that lead to the latest bust was initially started after authorities observed large cash transfers in Tenerife, the largest and most populated of Spain's Canary Islands. This may pose a serious problem for authorities moving forward as traffickers continue to exploit the continent's growing consumer market for illicit drugs like cocaine. Authorities in the European Union have a ""poor success rate in identifying and seizing illegal funds"" and ""confiscate as little as [one percent] of all criminal proceeds,"" according to Europol's EU Drug Markets Report for 2019. European agencies have also been racing to cope with the increase in cocaine entering the region, usually by ports. Multi-ton cocaine shipments departing from Colombia's port cities ""account for the biggest share of the cocaine entering the EU,"" according to Europol. Among other things, Europe offers traffickers a growing market with elevated street prices free from US interdiction. When not concealed in shipping containers leaving ports in Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador en route to large European ports, islands off the coast of Europe and West Africa, such as the Canary Islands or the Azores of Portugal in the Mid-Atlantic, provide convenient jumping-off points."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"US Declares End of Cali Cartels Business Empire, but Criminal Legacy Continues. Authorities in the United States have marked the destruction of the Cali Cartel's business empire by removing economic sanctions against over 300 people and entities linked to the organization, but there are indications that individuals tied to the cartel continue to participate in illegal activity. On June 19, the US Department of Treasury announced the removal of economic sanctions against 78 individuals and 230 entities once linked to the Cali Cartel. According to US authorities, the people and businesses removed from the list have proved they no longer participate in illegal activities. In a press release, the Treasury Department identified the removal as the ""largest single delisting"" in the history of the sanctions program and credited economic sanctions with the demise of the Cali Cartel's vast business empire. ""Today's action demonstrates the successful use of targeted sanctions,"" Adam Szubin, Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control said in the statement. Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, the brothers who ran the Cali Cartel, are now the only members of their family who remain on the list. During the height of their operations in the 1980s and 1990s, the Cali Cartel trafficked hundreds of tons of cocaine to the United States and Europe and amassed a fortune worth an estimated $12 billion. The cartel suffered a blow in 1995 when former US president Bill Clinton signed an executive order approving economic sanctions against suspected drug traffickers including the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, an extensive list of individuals and businesses that became known as the ""Clinton List."" While the tactic successfully targeted front companies used by criminal organizations to launder money, it has come under criticism for applying punitive measures to individuals and businesses without a trial. When the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers were convicted of drug trafficking and money laundering in the United States in 2006, some of their family members agreed to comply with Treasury Department requirements to be removed from the list. However, the Colombian drugstore chain Drogas La Rebaja, which authorities believe was used by the Cali Cartel to launder money, remains under investigation , while five children of Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela have been charged with concealing assets tied to the cartel's illegal activities. In addition two former cartel members who have served prison sentences in the United States have returned to Colombia and attempted to retake control of their lost criminal empires in Cali and the Valle del Cauca region."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"How Drug Trafficking Operates, Corrupts in Central America. While speaking before the US Congress' Central America Caucus on July 6, InSight Crime Co-Director Steven Dudley outlined how drug trafficking organizations on the isthmus operate and the implications for rule of law and security, before offering three concrete ways the US government can improve its counternarcotics strategy in the region. Drug Trafficking in Central America Central America has long been a bridge that connects the producer countries in South America to the consumer nations in the north, principally the United States. This role has led to the development of several different types of criminal organizations, some of them transnational, some of them local, and many more of them hyper-local. Some of the transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) have familiar names: the Sinaloa Cartel, the Gulf Cartel, the Zetas, and the Urabe n os all have operatives in Central America. They purchase cocaine or coca base from producer nations like Colombia and Peru. And they oversee the movement of that product from production point to market. In Central America, they oversee the second tier criminal organizations in these countries that provide the transportation for the illicit drugs. These so-called ""transportistas"" are often family-based groups with long criminal histories in contraband, human smuggling and other criminal activities, which give them a strong foundation to jump into narcotics trafficking. Examples include the Cachiros, a Honduran-based organization that once controlled a prominent route through northern Honduras, between Nicaragua and Guatemala. The Cachiros started as cattle rustlers who sold their stolen cattle to one of the country's most prominent elite families. Over the years, their land titles grew as did their role in illicit trafficking. By September 2013, the year the United States Treasury Department placed them on its ""Kingpin"" list , the Cachiros had accumulated anywhere between $500 million and $800 million in assets, much of which they had put into African Palm plantations, mining licenses, hotels, a prominent zoo-resort, and a local soccer team. It is these second tier, or transportista groups that inflict the most damaging consequences as it relates to drug trafficking. The Cachiros financed political parties of all stripes from would-be mayors to congressmen and perhaps above. They undermined local investigations against them and others by infiltrating the police, the local Attorney General's Office and courthouses throughout the country. They bought construction companies, so they could win government contracts, then kicked money back to the politicians who supported their bids. They backed land invasions of their business rivals. And they killed their drug trafficking rivals and others who opposed them with impunity. The increased drug trafficking in the region has had a trickle-down effect as well. Drug trafficking groups, from the TCOs to the local transportistas, pay local contractors and collaborators in-kind. The resulting flood of illicit drugs has turned traditional economics on its head: at InSight Crime, we found evidence of powdered cocaine being sold in the poorest Honduran neighborhoods. To be sure, that is not the drug of choice in those neighborhoods. Marijuana is. But it gives you an idea of the amount of drugs in the country and illustrates that supply can sometimes drive demand. The local dealers of these drugs are very often the street gangs. The gangs have no role in international drug trafficking. They are restricted to dealing drugs on the hyper-local level. This drug dealing has become a critical part of the gangs' criminal economy and thus a strong source of tension between gangs. In other words, the fight for the proverbial corner has become extremely violent in the last few years and helps us account for what has made Central America and, in particular the Northern Triangle nations of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, the most violent region in the world that is not at war. Local drug dealing has also allowed the gangs to accumulate more sophisticated weaponry, establish safe houses, buy businesses and expand their political reach. In some places, we have found gangs who are controlling the wholesale drug market. And in all three Northern Triangle countries, there are some parts of the gangs that are trying to become transportistas themselves. It appears they are still a long way from achieving that goal, but some of them are trying. Implications of Drug Trafficking The implications of drug trafficking in the region are devastating. Here are four major ones: 1) Corruption The aforementioned transportista networks make the difference between how much the drugs cost when they receive them and how much they cost when they are passed to the next transportista. Our calculations are that an organization like the Cachiros can make between $5 million and $12 million per month at these rates. On the whole, trafficking in a country like Honduras can make close to $700 million per year, which is 4 percent of the GDP, or about half the value of the country's top export, coffee. Guatemala and El Salvador have similar estimations, although El Salvador is more of a money laundering hub due to the dollarized economy. The money is more than just economic capital. It is political and social capital as well. Proceeds from these transport networks go into legitimate and illegitimate businesses, which provide thousands of jobs and are a key motor of the economy in many areas. They fund political parties and candidates, giving the transportistas a say about security as well as economic development strategies. They fund social functions, church events, and soccer clubs, many of which leap to the first divisions and compete for championships, like the Cachiros' funded club did from one year to the next. We in the US understand how important sports are to local pride. And at InSight Crime, when we crossed various social networks working with the Cachiros, we found the soccer team was the most important place where the country's elites, politicians and traffickers met and socialized. In the Cachiros case, their main business partners were from the Rosenthals, a prominent business and political family in the country. Jaime Rosenthal, the family patriarch, was thought to be one of the wealthiest people in Central America and was once vice president of Honduras. The Rosenthals own banks, insurance companies, television and media, telephone and communications companies, as well as soccer teams and many other businesses. When I met with Jaime Rosenthal in June 2015, and asked him directly about his relationship with the Cachiros, he told me he first met them in the late 1970s. The family that would become the Cachiros would arrive to the Rosenthal's meat-packing plant in a beat-up old truck to sell their cattle. Then they would sleep in the parking lot before driving back the next day. Over time, the Cachiros parked large amounts of their capital in the Rosenthal's banks. The US government indicted the Rosenthals last October, presumably for some of these interactions they had with the Cachiros. But these relationships between criminal groups and elites continue in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. 2) Impunity The transportistas also buy off prosecutors, police, and judges. They influence the judicial process from the beginning, first trying to make sure no one gets started on an investigation; then thwarting these investigations if they do get started. The Cachiros, for instance, were untouchable for years. No one even mentioned the name of the family at the center of it when I first started looking at the group in 2010. At InSight Crime, we spoke openly about them, but that is largely because we are not based in Honduras. Journalists in Honduras told me that they were too afraid to speak up, or that drug traffickers paid journalists to keep them out of the press. The impunity that results is contagious and the patterns set by the transportistas are repeated by other criminal groups. Judicial and security forces are bought off. Journalists are frightened or paid off. 3) Violence Although it is hard to quantify because the data is flawed or unavailable, the transportistas are involved in the violence that is afflicting this region. The maps of the most violent areas coincide with the areas presumed to be the drug trafficking routes. This includes the area where the Cachiros once operated, the municipality of Tocoa, which consistently has homicide rates of close to 100 per 100,000 inhabitants. In addition to the transportistas' role in the violence, which is largely rural in nature, we have to consider the spillover effect their activities have in urban areas. Specifically, we are talking about gang violence in the region's largest cities. As described earlier, these gangs control many of the local drug markets where they sell everything from powdered cocaine to forms of crack to marijuana. Between them, they are fighting for the proverbial corner, which InSight Crime believes is one of the main causes of homicide in these countries. 4) Migration The combination of corruption, impunity, and violence is a powerful push factor when it comes to migration. The areas from where we are seeing some of the most migrants are the areas of transportista and gang violence. The frustration and lack of trust these migrants have with their own authorities is evident in the countless testimonies that come across my desk. Others have done more systematic studies of these push factors, which I urge the Caucus to consult as they consider how to deal with this issue. US Policy US policy as it relates to drug trafficking in the region is slowly evolving. I will mention three key strategies that are at the core of dealing with this issue. 1) Kingpin Strategy The United States is focused on removing kingpins from the equation by either capturing or killing them. In some cases, the threat of a US capture leads suspects to hand themselves in to US authorities. This is what happened to the core of the Cachiros organization, which turned themselves in to the US in January 2015. The strategy has its positives. It disrupts the distribution chain, although transportista groups are fairly easily replaced. It also requires a certain amount of political will and coordination, so it is an illustration of progress of the local government and an important political sign to the country that impunity is waning. However, the kingpin strategy has its negatives. Cutting off the head of an organization can lead to chaos in the organization's area of influence, leading to upticks in violence as the groups reorganize and a new leading organization emerges. This strategy also requires a huge commitment of resources on the part of the local government, something that can take away from other strategies it might deem more important, such as going after the most violent criminal groups (instead of the most prolific drug trafficking groups). 2) Interdiction The second core strategy as it relates to dealing with drug trafficking is to interdict the flow of drugs. Intercepting drugs is a difficult and never-ending job, the fruits of which are rarely felt. The estimated amounts of drugs intercepted is small in the best of circumstances and miniscule in the case of the Northern Triangle nations. It requires a huge amount of resources, good will and practice. Yet it remains a key part of the US strategy. 3) Reforming/rebuilding the police The third core strategy worth mentioning is that of reforming and rebuilding police forces. The perennial issue as it relates to US counter-drug assistance is how to purge and restock the police forces. The US also assists in developing special units that assist the US counternarcotics agents in capturing or killing drug traffickers, and interdicting drug loads. The work has had some good results, and many police who go through the US filtering system become important agents of change within their institutions. The case of Guatemala is worth mentioning in this regard. Guatemala has added hundreds of new police in recent years, which have come through a more rigorous filter and passed through a longer training period. Honduras has also showed signs that it is ready to purge the police. A special Honduran police commission, with the blessing of the presidency, has started to remove questionable characters from the police. As opposed to most police commissions, this Honduran commission is starting from the top and moving its way downward. The US is assisting by prosecuting a number of police commanders for their involvement in a drug trafficking case. Recommendations It is difficult to completely change the course of counternarcotic strategy. It is less like the go-fast boats that carry drugs and more like the battleship that tries to corral them. But there is a need to update these strategies. Here are three recommendations of how to tweak US counternarcotic strategy: 1) Reconcile the US agenda with that of the local governments Many local governments are happy to get the assistance from the United States. It helps them beef up intelligence services, train personnel across the board, and it comes with additional equipment and other resources. But their agenda does not necessarily coincide with the US agenda, especially as it relates to counternarcotics. Many of these local governments are focused on violence, specifically homicides. And while the US agenda looks for results as it relates to the capture, killings and extraditions of kingpins, the locals want lower homicide rates and ways to reduce crimes like extortion. The US would do better by these countries if it allowed for the assistance to be put towards fulfilling the local agenda. In some cases, such as police reform, these agendas overlap nicely. But in others, such as the aforementioned kingpin strategy, they do not. Be sensitive to this and allow for shifts in resources that correspond to these local decisions rather than insisting on diverting resources towards US goals. In the case of stemming violence and extortion, this approach would also help these countries stem the flow of migration. 2) Focus on the money As noted, the US Treasury department has begun to play an important role in counternarcotics strategy. Indeed, it was not until Treasury put the Cachiros on the kingpin list in September of 2013, that things began to turn against the criminal group. The Treasury also put the Rosenthals on the kingpin list to coincide with the US Justice Department indictment of various family members in October 2015, including Jaime Rosenthal. Much of this work can be done from the United States. The US Treasury, in particular, can essentially shut down an operation just by adding its business to the kingpin list, as it did with the Rosenthals. This strategy has its negatives, not the least of which is the lack of transparency in the process and the lack of due process given to the accused. So in addition to adding more transparency to this process and providing some way to more effectively appeal these decisions before they become effective, the US government should devote more resources to dismantling the money side of these organizations. In the best case scenario, these designations for the kingpin list would go hand-in-hand with indictments. Going after the money side has an additional benefit. It is part of the way to extract political and economic elites from organized crime. These elites can open or shut the doors to organized crime and drug trafficking interests. Too often that door is wide open. The US can change that calculation by investigating and prosecuting these elites more vigorously. The Rosenthal case sent shudders through the region's elites. But the US cannot stop with the Rosenthals. 3) Provide more assistance to Attorney General's Offices The police are on the front lines of the battle against drug trafficking interests, and the US has long assisted in the strengthening of this institution, but the Attorney General's Offices are where the war is won or lost. These offices are generally devoid of resources, and in some cases systematically starved. Yet, as we can see from the case of Guatemala -- where the Attorney General's Office is at the center of nothing less than a revolutionary transformation of how people conceive of justice and political reform in that country following the resignation last year of the president and vice president for corruption -- these offices are forgotten by the US agencies that can most help them with training, resources, and support. That support goes beyond just providing better facilities, more wire-tapping services, and witness protection programs. It involves providing them with important political support, especially as it relates to cases in which powerful elites who have long treated the government as their own guard dogs are under judicial scrutiny. The Attorney General's Offices need political allies as much as they need financial support. The US can be that ally, ensuring judicial independence and ultimately opening the door for reform."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Denies Kidnapping of Honduran Consuls. Two Honduran diplomats reported being kidnapped temporarily by unknown perpetrators in Veracruz, Mexico last Saturday. But the state governor has already denied the version of the story presented by the Hondurans, indicating there may be a drawn-out, diplomatic spat. According to La Prensa, the vice consul and a friend reportedly left the Honduran consulate at midnight, driving the car belonging to the Honduran consul Raul Morazan. Captors supposedly took over the vehicle then crashed it, and the two victims were found, beaten and wearing handcuffs, on a road outside the city at 5 a.m. But as quickly as Honduras closed its consular offices in Veracuz, Governor Fidel Herrera was just as quick to come forth with an even stranger version of events. The vice consul was detained briefly by police due to ""excess celebrations"", said Herrera, adding, ""there never was a kidnapping."" Honduran officials have strongly denied this and have delivered warnings that other Honduran consulates across Mexico may be closed, if security measures are not increased. "	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Honduras Disputes Homicide Stats as Elections Near. A debate over official homicide statistics in Honduras raise questions about whether the government is politicizing murder rates in the run-up to presidential elections. The country's Security Ministry has reported 2,629 homicides for the first half of 2013, a much lower total than the 3,547 homicides counted during the same period by the Violence Observatory at the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH). Security Minister Arturo Corrales claimed the discrepancy is due to a difference in methodology, reported El Heraldo. According to Corrales, the government only registers homicides documented by the Attorney General's Office -- a method that excludes disappearances, unidentified bodies or lack of an official government report. The Observatory, on the other hand, tracks all police reports of violent deaths, as well as forensics and Attorney General's Office reports of deaths. It then has a regular meeting in which it determines which murders it includes and which it weeds out because of discrepancies, and from there determines the total. The discrepancy goes to the heart of a problem with statistics: they often reflect the needs of the administration in power rather than the reality on the ground. The irony is that government anointed the Observatory the task of collating the data for exactly this reason, but it appears that politics may soon smother it. Presidential elections are November 24, and the ruling National Party's candidate, Juan Orlando Hernandez, is in a tight race with Libre party candidate Xiomara Castro de Zelaya. The Security Ministry's lower statistics would represent an 18 percent drop in homicides, a highly improbable scenario in the world's most violent country , where 2012 was the deadliest year on record and killings had risen year-on-year since 2004. The ministry may be reaching unnecessarily. According to Observatory data, the current rate for 2013 is 80 per 100,000 people, representing a more than six percent decrease from last year. The Observatory had previously predicted a 6 percent drop in the homicide rate for 2013, due mostly to population growth. With the inauguration of a new military police force following the recent deployment of the military in the country's major cities , it is also in the interests of the government to present more positive statistics to support its continued pursuit of militarized law enforcement.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"El Salvador Receives Giulianis Security Gospel. During his most recent foray into Central America, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani presented a plan to El Salvador for combating widespread crime and insecurity. However, doubts about the wisdom and applicability of his recommendations continue to be raised in the region. On May 4, 2015, Giuliani spoke at the National Conference for Private Business (ENADE) hosted by El Salvador's national business association (ANEP). During his presentation, he outlined the recommendations of his consulting firm, Giuliani Security & Safety (GSS), reported La Prensa Grafica. The document reportedly contains 47 proposals, which are centered on three basic principles. These include increasing the use of technology to prevent and combat crime, improving coordination among security institutions and using resources effectively. One recommendation is to create a system similar to what is known as the CompStat in the United States. Locations and the natures of crimes are entered into a database available to police. They will then be able to track criminal trends in a given area and respond accordingly. Another key point is to improve the collection and use of scientifically-based evidence in criminal proceedings. This involves increasing the number of security cameras, in order to reduce dependence on eyewitnesses, who are often reluctant to testify for fear of personal safety. Giuliani said El Salvador's high violence levels are not ""impossible to reduce."" He went on to clarify that none of his recommendations would be effective without true political will on the part of the government to eradicate corruption and to reduce crime. At the meeting, the president of ANEP, Jorge Daboub, presented the GSS document to President Salvador Sanchez Ceren, who expressed his appreciation and assurance that his government was working towards combating crime. President Ceren announced that his government would soon begin implementing two new laws, one of which involves the rehabilitation of gang members into society. Giuliani's proposals for improving security and attacking crime in El Salvador comes as violence in the country has been surging. This follows the collapse of a truce between the country's two major gangs, the MS13 and Barrio 18. In April, 2015 there was an average of 14 homicides per day. That number has increased to 15 for the first four days of May. In response, the Salvadoran government has been working towards implementing measures to combat rising instability. President Ceren recently announced the creation of four new battalions to fight crime. The government also proposed its first ever gang rehabilitation law. It remains to be seen if -- and how -- the Salvadoran government chooses to integrate Giuliani's proposals into their security policies. Nonetheless, as InSight Crime has noted previously , doubts remain over the applicability of his security recommendations in Central America. Giuliani's recommendations are based on his experience as mayor of New York City and rely on the dubious ""broken windows"" theory. This approach has been accused of encouraging heavy-handed policing tactics. Indeed, statements by Giuliani that El Salvador's gangs "" need to be annihilated,"" and his recommendation that criminals should receive ""extraordinary sentences,"" echoes past ""mano dura"" (iron fist) policies in Central America. However, evidence suggests that the policies have actually been counterproductive at reducing crime."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Homicide Case Points to FARC-Sinaloa Cartel Links. The recent murder of a Colombian official has brought to light a criminal coalition in which local businessmen, Mexican drug traffickers, and the Urabenos work with the FARC guerrillas to launder drug money and move cocaine. Celia Escobar Florez, a top inspector for Colombia's tax and customs agency, known by its Spanish acronym DIAN, in the southwestern Huila province, was murdered on May 10 in the province capital Neiva. According to newspaper El Tiempo , police believe her murder was ordered by a local businessman -- who officials requested remain anonymous -- after she refused to accept bribes to halt investigations into suspected money laundering operations. Prosecutors believe the businessman is involved in laundering money for the Teofilo Forero Column of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and also serves as a contact for the FARC with Mexico's Sinaloa and Gulf Cartels. According to El Tiempo, the businessman has a style reminiscent of Pablo Escobar, investing in extravagant public works projects while rubbing shoulders with the Huila elite. Officials say the Huila town of Pitalito is a key center of money laundering operations, and is also home to two important drug traffickers linked to the rebels -- Mexican citizen alias ""El Sinaloeno,"" who serves as a contact between Mexico and the head of the Teofilo Forero Column, and alias ""Patrocinio,"" a member of the Urabenos believed to be helping the Mexicans obtain FARC cocaine. The current report illustrates a FARC strategy common to criminal organizations of using well-connected middlemen -- often with connections to multiple groups -- to facilitate the movement of drugs and money and to organize money laundering schemes. The report also serves to highlight the FARC's international connections, something also evidenced by the fact that an estimated 70 percent of the guerrilla organization's assets are held outside Colombia. Seized computer files showed FARC links with the Sinaloa Cartel date back to at least 2010; a more recent report indicated that the guerrilla organization has been selling off its drug franchises to the Mexican organization. Established FARC-Urabenos drug connections have evolved as well, with the neo-paramilitary group reportedly taking over some of the FARC's drug trafficking operations."	1	0	0	1	1	0	0
"Family of the North Likely Close to Its End in Manaus, Brazil. The city of Manaus has awoken red in recent weeks: the painting of the Red Command gang's insignia ""CV"" on its walls, the chanting of ""Vermelho"" (red) from its largest prison, and bloodshed throughout its poor neighborhoods. The capital of Brazil's northern state of Amazonas is the brutal battleground in a prolonged feud between two drug gangs: the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) and Family of the North (Familia do Norte -- FDN). Since January, the Red Command, whose power base is in Rio de Janeiro, has sought to put an end to the war through a violent takeover of Manaus. As a result, the city saw 106 murders in January and a further 55 by February 16, according to Brazilian media citing police figures. SEE ALSO : Red Command News and Profile The Red Command's bloody campaign has led to it controlling 80 percent of Manaus' neighborhoods, local newspaper Em Tempo reported , quoting police sources. In February, the Red Command launched an attack into the neighborhood of Compensa, an FDN stronghold in Manaus and home to FDN leader Jose Roberto Fernandes Barbosa, alias ""Ze Roberto da Compensa,"" wrote Em Tempo. The violence in Compensa has shaken residents. On February 13, Red Command members gunned down a 31-year-old man who came across them while they were tagging walls. Video of the killing of Wallemberg Vieira Bello, which surfaced on social media, shows the men spray painting the letters ""CV"" when several shots are suddenly fired. Gang members also have made public celebrations of their victories. ""Fireworks in every neighborhood. Drug traffickers celebrating the end of a rival faction. Manaus has become Gotham City without Batman,"" wrote one Twitter user. The state government of Amazonas, which has shown little capacity to stop the bloodshed, announced February 10 that it had created a crisis team within the government alongside other security measures that included isolating prisoners and halting all visits to prisons. The Red Command's invasion of Manaus may spell the end of the Family of the North as a major criminal player after the group's fracturing in 2019 and the killing of many of its members in repeated prison riots. A police source told Em Tempo that members of the FDN are being told to ""become red"" or become dead. ""There are some who are running away from not wanting to join the [Red Command] or from fear of being executed,"" the police source said. The source attributed the Red Command's crushing victory to its use of extreme violence. ""They are far more violent. They kill and do it brutally. The FDN was already in a more 'peaceful' phase because they were focused on drug trafficking, without many clashes. This is also why they lost the territories so quickly,"" the source told the paper. The list of Manaus neighborhoods in the hands of the Red Command reportedly includes Aparecida, Centro, Matinha, Vila da Prata, Cidade de Deus, Ouro Verde and Santa Etelvina. The FDN was not in any state to fight back. Its war with the Red Command, ever since an alliance between the two gangs fell apart in 2018, had been progressively taking its toll. The prisons of Amazonas became the battlegrounds, with dozens dying in successive assaults. Worse yet, in May 2019, 55 FDN prisoners were killed when one of the gang's lieutenants, Joao Pinto Carioca, alias ""Joao Branco,"" sought to take over control from Ze Roberto da Compensa. The FDN has also had trouble keeping its leadership intact. In 2018, FDN leader Gelson Carnauba, alias ""Mano G"" -- who had forged an alliance between his gangs and the Red Command -- switched sides and joined the Red Command. In the current invasion of Manaus, graffiti bearing Mano G's name has been seen across the city, suggesting he is playing a crucial role in his former gang's downfall. Since February 10, the Red Command reportedly issued statements saying that the violence was coming to an end. For at least 48 hours, between February 17 and 19, no homicides were reported in the city."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Brazils Youth Violence Crisis Deepening: Report. Nearly four in every 1,000 Brazilian adolescents living in the country's biggest cities are murdered before the age of 19, according to a new UN report that illustrates how Brazilian youth pay the highest price for crime and violence. The report by the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), "" Adolescent Homicides in Brazil "" studies murder trends for teenagers in 300 Brazilian municipalities with more than 100,000 residents between 2005 and 2014. The findings chart a disturbing trend that suggests an already dire situation is only getting worse. In 2005, 2.8 out of every 1,000 youths were murdered, an alarming figure given that the expected rate should be only slightly above 0 and certainly below 1, UNICEF points out. The rate remained relatively stable until 2012, when it began a sharp rise culminating in the 2014 rate of 3.7. The report also traces the huge regional and socio-economic variances. By 2014, male youths were 13.52 times more likely to be murdered than females, and black adolescents 2.88 times more likely than white. By far the most dangerous region is the northeast of Brazil, which registered an average rate of 6.5 murders for every 1,000 adolescents, and is where seven of the top ten most dangerous municipalities for youths are located. The municipality of Fortaleza recorded the highest murder rate, with 10.9 murders per 1,000, followed by Maceio with 9.4. Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, the two cities that receive the most public attention over organized crime and violence, meanwhile, actually ranked below the average, recording rates of 2.71 and 2.19 respectively. If the trends established over the period continue, then 43,000 more adolescents will be murdered in the 300 municipalities between 2015 and 2021, UNICEF concludes. The UNICEF report highlights how Brazil is one of the more extreme examples of a trend seen across the region: violence by and against young people, especially young males. According to World Bank data from 2016 , the homicide rate for males aged 15-24 in Latin America and the Caribbean reaches 92 per 100,000, almost four times the regional average. A significant factor in this violence is organized crime, which capitalizes on the social and economic marginalization of youth to recruit cheap, disposable labor used for everything from intelligence work to assassinations. This places adolescents at risk in numerous ways; either they are involved in criminal activities, their peers are involved, they resist criminal attempts to recruit or use them, or they are stigmatized by states forces that treat youths as criminals. As InSight Crime has documented , this is a phenomenon seen throughout the region's organized crime hotspots, with Colombia, Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras displaying alarming indicators of young people taking part in and being victimized by organized crime. Perhaps the most alarming aspect documented by UNICEF is the rapid rise in violence in recent years. This increase is the most damning indicator that security policies based on social interventions targeting vulnerable youth are either ineffective or entirely absent."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Amid Growing Role in Drug Trade, Argentina Sees Spike In Kidnappings. Kidnapping appears to be increasing in Argentina amidst a crime wave that could be a side effect of the country's growing domestic drug market and role as a drug transit nation. According to statistics from the Attorney General's Office accessed by La Nacion , 696 kidnappings were reported in Argentina between January 1 and September 30 this year. Of these, 201 -- just under 29 percent -- occurred in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. The majority of the kidnapping victims were chosen randomly and held hostage in vehicles rather than in safe houses, reported La Nacion. Express kidnappings in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area often start out as vehicle robberies, then morph into kidnappings if the driver is perceived as being wealthy. In one prominent case in July, the father of professional soccer player Carlos Tevez was kidnapped for five hours after a criminal group attempted to steal his vehicle and realized who he was. According to La Nacion, only a small number of kidnappings involve a criminal group that is deliberately targeting a specific individual. Some of the kidnapping groups that operate in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area employ sophisticated tactics , such as listening to police radio frequencies and taking precautions to keep their calls from being traced. Groups also transfer victims from one vehicle to another and keep them in constant movement to reduce the probability that security forces will be able to locate them. In addition to demanding cash ransoms, there have also been reports of kidnapping groups asking for weapons in exchange for a hostage's release. In some cases, the groups also force the victim to drive to his or her home so they can steal cash and valuables. Although the majority of the kidnappings reported in the 2014 figures are likely extortive kidnappings, the Attorney General's Office cautioned that some may be cases of ""virtual"" kidnappings -- in which a perpetrator calls up a victim and pretends to have kidnapped his or her family member -- mistakenly reported as extortive. As of May 2014, police were registering around 200 cases of virtual kidnappings a week in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. There have also been cases of virtual kidnappers using technology to make their claims seem more believable. Perpetrators have hacked into social media accounts or cell phones, and impersonated the ""victim"" in order to convince family and friends that a kidnapping has actually taken place. The high number of kidnappings in Argentina could be related to the country's booming domestic drug market and increasing role as a transit nation for drug shipments. Both of these factors have contributed to the rise of local criminal groups. In some cases, these gangs started out in the local drug trade, before moving into other criminal activities like extortion, money laundering, targeted assassinations -- and perhaps now kidnappings. Elsewhere in Latin America, Mexico has seen a similar pattern emerge. Last year, the country recorded its highest number of kidnappings ever -- 1,698 -- amid widespread drug war violence. This is partly due to the fragmentation of the larger drug cartels: the resulting splinter groups tend to look to other activities, like kidnapping, to earn funds, if they are no longer able to depend on transnational drug trafficking. Although Argentina's Attorney General's Office does not publish kidnapping statistics, the frequency of the crime does appear to be increasing in comparison with recent years. According to La Nacion, Buenos Aires saw 43 kidnappings reported in 2011, 31 in 2012, and 51 in 2013, compared to 70 cases investigated by federal prosecutors in the city and a total of 201 in the metropolitan area in just the first nine months of this year. In addition, a 2013 United Nations report on citizen security identifies Argentina as one of four countries in Latin America with the highest kidnapping rates. According to the US State Department , long-term kidnappings are rare in Argentina compared to express kidnappings. These are more common in the southern part of the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, while long-term kidnappings with higher ransoms are more typical further north. There may be other factors besides organized crime dynamics that have led to more kidnappings in Argentina. According to a security consultancy in Buenos Aires , middle-class victims have become more of a target for kidnappers following regulations limiting cash withdrawals, and a widespread distrust of banks that has led to a tendency to store large sums of cash in houses and apartments. Unlike in Mexico and Colombia, where kidnappings are often carried out by drug cartels and illegal armed groups, the criminal groups behind kidnappings in Argentina appear to be much smaller and less sophisticated. According to the book Kidnapping in Latin America , many kidnapping groups in Argentina started out in robberies, then moved on to kidnapping in the early 2000s. These groups often had ties to corrupt security forces, and police were implicated in several prominent kidnapping cases in the early 2000s, including three in which the victim was later found dead. The alleged collusion of security forces with kidnapping gangs eventually prompted former President Nestor Kirchner, who was elected in 2003, to order a review of the police force in the province of Buenos Aires."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
Ecuador Case Highlights Effect of Land Theft on Urban Poor. More than 2,000 working-class families in an Ecuador slum were tricked into buying small plots of land that were never for sale, in an example of a regional crime that strongly affects rural areas but can also have a major impact in cities. During the past few years, the already crowded Pacific port city of Guayaquil has drawn masses of people to outlying towns, according to El Telegrafo. The new arrivals are often sold small plots of land, sometimes with makeshift homes, by fraudsters who have no claim to it, officials say. In the Monte Sinai sector in the northeast of the city, one man was recently arrested for defrauding 2,400 families, reported El Comercio. The case is not unique: Julio Cesar Quinonez, secretary for the prevention of illegal settlements, said land traffickers had affected nearly 19,000 families in that sector. He also said there were 103 people in Ecuador being prosecuted for land fraud, Ecuadorinmediato.com reported. Quinonez and his office have spearheaded changes to the penal code to make it easier for authorities to go after land hustlers and ensure that people who were defrauded are compensated for their losses. While land theft in Latin America is often linked to eco-trafficking and agriculture , small urban plots can also be vulnerable. In the case of Guayaquil's slums, it seems to be in part the product of a state ill-equipped to deal with the large influx of people to the city. However, the government has made clear attempts to rectify the problem, creating the irregular settlements office a few years ago. Land trafficking and theft remain stubborn issues in other countries as well. It is especially prevalent in Guatemala, which recorded 1,400 cases of the crime in 2013. Nicaragua too has been affected, and in January, a man was arrested as part of a group that organized illegal land sales and invasions in the country's main forest reserve The crime is often facilitated by corrupt officials and businessmen. In Argentina, a criminal group was recently accused of stealing three properties belonging to a deceased painter , while in one case in Guatemala a property theft ring used government workers to falsify documents .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Court: Drug Trafficking is Political Crime. Colombia's Supreme Court president suggested that the judiciary won't block efforts by lawmakers to ensure that FARC guerrillas receive amnesty for alleged drug trafficking crimes, one of the more controversial points of the country's peace process. On September 17, President of the Supreme Court Jose Leonidas Bustos said he believed it was possible to define drug trafficking as a ""political"" crime, ""When it is used as a tool to economically support political ends in an armed conflict."" The Attorney General's Office later released a copy of Bustos' full remarks , which are significant due to ongoing uncertainty over whether top leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group will be extradited to the US to face drug trafficking charges. According to the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), US courts have indicted at least 60 FARC members on drug trafficking and related charges. The FARC has been involved in peace talks with the Colombian government since 2012, and the issue of possible extradition to the US has long cast a shadow over negotiations. In one possible scenario, FARC leaders could be granted amnesty from extradition, if Colombia's judiciary and legislature rules they participated in drug trafficking in order to fund themselves during the armed conflict. Bustos' comments implied that for now, Colombia's judiciary supports President Juan Manuel Santos' position on the matter , and is prepared to view the FARC's drug trafficking activities as a ""political"" rather than a criminal issue. Santos has said that Colombia's current peace process will not succeed if the government cannot assure the guerrillas they will not be prosecuted for drug crimes after they demobilize. Bustos' assertion prompted criticism from the most prominent opponents of Colombia's current peace process: former president and current Senator Alvaro Uribe, and the General Inspector of Colombia, Alejandro Ordonez Maldonado. While this was to be expected, it is nonetheless indicative of the tough task facing the Santos administration: selling the prospect of a FARC amnesty to the Colombian public. The FARC have previously said the guerrillas want ""zero jail,"" a scenario that war-weary Colombians are highly unlikely to tolerate. The government is unlikely to mete out justice to the FARC in a way that would please hardline opponents of the peace process, like Uribe. However, as pointed out by Colombian legal expert Rodrigo Uprimny in an interview with Verdad Abierta (excerpts of which were republished in English by WOLA ), if the government doesn't manage to win over other skeptics, ""the peace is already lost."" It is possible that Santos' government may yet rely on legal wrangling -- such as passing laws that would definite drug trafficking as a political crime in certain cases -- in order to avoid the Herculean task of building a stronger political consensus around the peace process. Bustos' comments may be another hint that that the government is ready and willing to go down this road."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Two Ton Seizure Shows Peru Cocaine Moving Through Ecuador. Authorities in Ecuador have seized two tons of cocaine near the border with Peru, suggesting the country's growing role as a drug transit point for traffickers moving Peruvian as well as Colombian cocaine. On November 20, police in Pasaje, in the border province of El Oro, seized two tons of cocaine and arrested five people, reported Hoy. According to Minister of the Interior Jose Serrano, who announced the seizure on his Twitter account, authorities found $160,000 cash along with the drugs. The seizure, part of ""Operation Halcon,"" (Falcon) brings the total quantity of drugs seized this year in Ecuador to 53 tons, according to Serrano. That number continues the trend of increasing drug seizures in Ecuador, which rose from 18 tons in 2010 to 42 tons in 2012, reported El Comercio. The El Oro seizure is the latest capture of multiple ton shipments of drugs in Ecuador, which has become a major transshipment point for drugs being trafficked to Europe, the US and other major markets. Ecuador could soon rival Venezuela as one of the primary South American drug dispatch points. Transnational organized crime groups, particularly the Colombian Rastrojos and Urabenos , as well as Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel , have traditionally controlled trafficking routes through Ecuador. Given the size of the El Oro shipment, it is likely linked to one of these major groups. However, El Oro is far from normal Colombian operations, which are based in the northern part of the country near the border, and commonly use the port of Guayaquil. The discovery of large drug shipments near the southern border suggest a well-established trafficking infrastructure capable of moving drugs from production centers in central Peru, now the world's largest cocaine producer. Colombian brokers manage many of Peru's trafficking routes, while InSight Crime field investigations and the recent discovery of a large-scale export operation also point to a strong Mexican presence in the Piura region, a transshipment point in northwestern Peru."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Paraguays EPP: Phantom or Rebel Army?A recently released hostage of Paraguayan guerrilla group the EPP says his captors boasted about their links to Colombia, Venezuela and Cuba. This adds weight to the small-time group's claim to be a full-fledged insurgency. Farmer Fidel Zavala was released in January after being held by the Paraguayan People's Army (Ejercito del Pueblo Paraguayo - EPP) for more than three months. In his first statement to the press , he said that while he was in captivity he had heard the guerrillas boasting about having received training in Venezuela, Colombia , and Cuba. The guerrillas talked about President Hugo Chavez as a hero, and bragged about how easily they could buy cheap weapons in Venezuela, according to Zavala. He also said his captors used Colombian terms in conversation, making their claim to have spent time in Colombian training camps more plausible. While much of this could be dismissed as bravado from a fairly weak guerrilla group, claims have been surfacing for many years linking the EPP to Venezuela and Colombia, specifically to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ). In April 2010 a Paraguayan prosecutor said there was evidence that the links between the FARC and the EPP went back at least a decade, before the EPP was even active under its current name. It appears that much of this contact involves military aid from the FARC to its Paraguayan counterpart. Based in part on documents found on the computer hard disks of FARC commander alias ""Raul Reyes,"" the official stated that the FARC had sent advisers to Paraguay, and had trained Paraguayan guerrillas in Colombian camps. She also asserted that a number of recent kidnappings in her country appeared to follow the methods of the Colombian guerrillas, and that the FARC had claimed a 30 percent share of the proceeds of one notorious 2001 kidnapping case carried out by a group that would later become the EPP. The Colombian government warned in June 2006 that the FARC could be training Paraguayans in kidnapping techniques and the use of explosives, while Paraguay's prosecutor general said in the same month that the authorities suspected that there were FARC operatives active in the country. The EPP's reported boasts of links with Venezuela also have precedents. In June 2010 the Paraguayan press published photos found in an EPP camp, which apparently showed a suspected militant, thought to be the EPP's main contact with Venezuela, in the company of Paraguayan and Venezuelan officials including Chavez's Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro. If true, these well-established foreign connections would suggest that the EPP has some political weight as an insurgent group -- something that has been questioned in Paraguay. One bishop claimed last year that the EPP is a not a real insurgency but a cover used by criminal groups linked to narco-traffickers and ""narco-ranchers."" Some commentators have claimed the government used the EPP as an excuse to declare a state of emergency in 2010. The Union of Paraguayan Journalists (Sindicato de Periodistas del Paraguay - SPP) released a statement in January claiming that the ""phantasmagorical"" EPP were merely a device used by the authorities to distract the population. The EPP has roots going back to the 1990s, but was only established in its current form and under its current name in 2008, according to documents found by in a guerrilla camp by the security forces , but just how far it is a coherent rebel movement is a matter for debate. Estimates on its numbers vary, but it is often said to have fewer than 100 members -- a far cry from more sophisticated and established groups like the FARC, which is thought to have some 8,000 troops. As InSight reported in January, an EPP ""training camp"" supposedly busted by the government was later said to be a very amateur effort, with wooden guns used for weapons training. Paraguay's government maintains that the EPP is very much in existence and poses a threat to public safety. Interior Minister Rafael Filizzola said in January that the EPP was a criminal organization that must be tackled, declaring that it ""is not an invention of the government."" The statements from the former hostage would appear to back this claim. Even if the EPP is still not a significant homegrown insurgency, it seems to be a group with stated political aims and some military training, albeit likely imported from abroad. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Trump Doubles Down on Inaccurate Link Between MS13, Immigration. US President Donald Trump is doubling down on his administration's rhetorical campaign against the MS13 as a way to promote tougher immigration laws and border enforcement, but the strategy is likely to impede rather than advance efforts to tackle the gang. President Trump traveled to Long Island, New York, on May 23 to discuss immigration policy and what he called ""the menace of MS13"" during a forum in the Nassau County hamlet of Bethpage. Among the panelists gathered by Rep. Peter King (R-NY) were congressional representatives, federal and local law enforcement officials and family members of several of the MS13's local victims -- all of whom were supportive of the Trump administration's decision to respond to cases of MS13 violence with an immigration crackdown. During the event, Trump claimed that MS13 gang members in the United States have ""violated our borders and transformed our neighborhoods into bloodstained killing fields,"" and have ""exploited glaring loopholes"" to ""enter the country as unaccompanied minors."" Trump reiterated his frequent claims that the United States has the ""worst immigration laws of any country anywhere in the world"" and accused Democrats in the US Congress of refusing to ""close these loopholes"" that allow MS13 gang members to ""infiltrate our communities."" A White House fact sheet issued just before the event referred to these same ""deadly loopholes."" Acting Assistant Attorney General John Cronan and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Deputy Director Thomas Homan both pointed to US support for law enforcement efforts against the MS13 in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala as a way to stop gang members ""before they cross our border."" However, Trump once again threatened to cut aid to these countries because ""they're not trying to stop this."" Trump's Long Island visit, his second since entering office, came on the heels of a roundtable held in California last week about so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" which he and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have blamed for facilitating the MS13's expansion. During the meeting, Trump referred to undocumented immigrants entering the country as ""animals,"" sparking a media backlash. Nonetheless, the Trump administration doubled down on the comments, with the White House issuing a press release calling MS13 gang members ""animals"" ten times. Trump received a round of applause during the Long Island event when he said, ""I was met with rebuke. They said 'they're people.' They're not people, they're animals."" Trump's continuing conflation of MS13 activity and immigration to the United States is painting an inaccurate picture of the gang, leading the administration to adopt ineffective policies that in some cases directly interfere with strategies that could work. As InSight Crime extensively reported in its multi-year investigation of the MS13, ""the Trump administration has used the MS13 as a bogeyman to draw support for its policy of searching out and deporting more undocumented migrants."" However, there is no evidence beyond isolated cases to support the theory that unaccompanied alien children (UACs) are broadly linked to the MS13. Rather than stemming the MS13's activities, the Trump administration's calls to crack down on immigrant communities could hamper investigations. Last year, police chiefs from three different US counties impacted by the MS13 said that Trump's policies could undermine anti-gang efforts by destroying community trust and disincentivizing residents from providing information to law enforcement. Indeed, some individuals who have cooperated with authorities against the MS13 have nevertheless been put into deportation proceedings. Rep. Thomas Suozzi (D-NY), whose district includes Bethpage, was not invited to the May 23 forum, but reinforced these concerns in comments given to Newsday. Suozzi urged Trump to ""be clearer in encouraging law-abiding citizens, whether they're documented or undocumented, to come forward to police with information"" because ""effective community policing is essential"" to ""root out the bad guys."""	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Panama Busts Colombian Drug Trafficking Ring. Panama announced the arrest of 80 members of a Colombian -led drug trafficking organization that moved cocaine from Central America to the United States via Panama's Caribbean coast. The arrests were reportedly the result of an investigation carried out by Panamanian authorities in collaboration with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Simultaneous raids at 30 locations netted 162 kilograms of cocaine, as well as firearms and vehicles. Eighty people were arrested, 61 of them Panamanian and 19 Colombian. Colombian national Jose Indalecio Marmolejo Parra (above left) is suspected of heading the ring. A former associate of drug lord Pablo Escobar, Parra has been implicated in weapons and drug trafficking in Colombia and Costa Rica. Parra was arrested on gun charges in July and is under house arrest in Panama. Panama's Anti-Drug Prosecutor Javier Caraballo alleged that the group was responsible for transporting at least 18 tons of cocaine to the United States in the last two years, using Caribbean maritime routes. There is evidence that the trafficking network is involved with selling weapons to Colombia's left-wing guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ), and is likely responsible for a number of murders in Panama City. The operation to dismantle Parra's trafficking network follows recent anti-narcotics successes by Panama authorities, including the seizure of several tons of liquid cocaine in July as well as a heroin shipment worth more than $70 million dollars. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Colombia On Track for New Asset Seizure Record. Colombia has seized over $440 million in the first two months of 2015 as part of an aggressive program to confiscate criminal assets, putting the country on track for another year of record high seizures. Between January 1 and February 23 this year, Colombian authorities confiscated 145 assets valued at more than $442 million dollars, reported El Tiempo. If seizures continue at the current pace, Colombia will surpass the record $1.4 billion in assets seized in 2014. Examples of recent seizures include a more than 700-hectare plot of land in Cartagena connected to the Norte del Valle Cartel (NDVC), worth around $4 million dollars, and a luxury home that belonged to Eugenio Montoya Sanchez, the brother of former NDVC faction leader Diego Montoya Sanchez, alias ""Don Diego."" Drug traffickers aren't the only ones affected by the seizures. Colombian authorities have also targeted assets belonging to an extortion gang in Medellin, former government officials, and a ""meat cartel"" that allegedly smuggled 4,000 cattle across the border from Venezuela. The effort to prioritize seizures has also led to the creation of a special intelligence unit in the Attorney General's Office dedicated to tracing assets from guerrilla groups the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). The increase in confiscated assets may be the result of changes to Colombia's property seizure law, which were approved in January 2014. Last September, former Vice Prosecutor General Wilson Martinez told InSight Crime the new rules could enable authorities to cut the time it takes to complete a seizure in half. The legal changes also allow authorities to more easily take assets from suspected criminals who have not yet been convicted. Still, previous failures have tarnished the reputation of a law once touted by former President Alvaro Uribe as one of the country's ""most-feared"" anti-narcotics tools. After a scandal in which billions of dollars in seized assets went missing, the National Narcotics Directorate (DNE) -- the agency responsible for managing confiscated assets -- was officially dissolved last year and replaced by the Special Assets Association (SAE). In addition, in spite of record high seizures in 2014, Colombian authorities still only seizes a fraction of the country's criminal assets. Previous estimates indicate that Colombia confiscates 3 percent or less of yearly criminal earnings. The government has also failed to collect close to $3.4 billion in outstanding fines leveled against drug traffickers, guerrilla groups, and paramilitaries."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Defense Minister Takes Fall for Rising Insecurity. Colombia's Defense Minister Rodrigo Rivera announced his resignation amidst concern about rising crime and activity by illegal armed groups. Rivera announced that he would leave the post he had held since President Juan Manuel Santos came to power just over a year ago. Despite a number of successes against the leadership of paramilitary and guerrilla organizations during his tenure, including the killing of Victor Suarez Rojas, alias "" Mono Jojoy ,"" a senior commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ), and paramilitary leader Pedro Oliveiro Guerrero, alias "" Cuchillo ,"" the perception of insecurity in Colombia is growing. Kidnappings in Colombia rose 30 percent in the first half of 2011 , and the number of attacks on infrastructure by guerrilla groups increased. Crime indicators, in particular rates of extortion and robbery, appear to be growing in urban areas, contributing to the public perception of insecurity. Rivera has faced criticism for his failure to confront the criminal groups (BACRIM) that have strengthened since the dissolution of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC) as well as internal discontent within the military. The departure of the ""Uribista"" minister marks another blow to the former president's influence in the current government. Rivera will be replaced by Juan Carlos Pinzon , who served as deputy defense minister during the administration of previous President Alvaro Uribe, as well as Santos' chief of staff. There is little evidence that the rise in attacks is due to any alteration in government security policy , which has remained largely unchanged under the Santos government. The FARC rebels are continuing their policy, begun in 2008, of stepping up guerrilla-style attacks against the security forces. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Cocaine Seizure, Extortion Ring Bust Points to Guatemala Role in Regional Crime. A drug seizure in Costa Rica and the dismantling of an extortion network which targeted El Salvadorans, both allegedly run by Guatemalan nationals, are signs of the growing role played by Guatemalans in criminal activities outside of their native country. According to Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Libre , authorities found 1,130 pounds of cocaine and heroin in a house in Costa Rica's capital, rented by two Guatemalan nationals. The drugs were allegedly en route to Guatemala. The seizure is one sign of the increasingly active role played by Guatemalans in criminal activities throughout Central America. This goes for other activities besides the transport of drugs. According to El Salvadoran newspaper El Mundo , on July 22 police announced they had arrested 14 people, part of a criminal network based in Guatemala, dedicated to extorting victims in El Salvador. A network of 21 Guatemalans would extort victims through phone calls, demanding payments of up to $3,000, the report says. The scheme may have earned the group $1.5 million from El Salvadoran sources. While Guatemalans were in charge of making the phone calls and handling the payments through bank accounts, the head of the group is allegedly an El Salvadoran member of the MS-13 , according to El Mundo. In early May, a Guatemalan drug lord was arrested in Honduras , another indication of the reach of Guatemalan criminal groups across Central America. But Guatemala has also suffered the incursion of other criminal organizations within its own borders. Most notably, Mexican group the Zetas are known to control a vast portion of the northern Peten department. In mid-May, the Zetas were responsible for the massacre of 27 people in Peten , in what was apparently a revenge attack against a local trafficker. 	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
How Much Of Mexicos Violence Is Fueled By Its Domestic Drug Market?Mexican crime analyst Alejandro Hope takes a look at Mexico's recently released National Addiction Survey, what it says about the domestic market for drugs and the corresponding level of violence in the country. On October 28, Mexico's official statistics agency released the country's National Addiction Survey (ENA) , a comprehensive survey on drug use in the country. Among its findings was that the number of illicit drug users, which shot up from .2 percent in 2002 to 1.4 percent in 2008, has been relatively stable since the latest poll, with 1.5 percent of respondents reporting the use of an illicit substance. Below, Alejandro Hope examines what this might mean for Mexico's domestic drug market. These are my initial thoughts; more will come as I continue processing this information. There is, however, a topic that deserves special attention. In recent days, several analysts have endorsed the theory that, given the low prevalence of consumption shown in the survey, the domestic drug market is too small to explain the rise of violence in the past couple of years. I'm not opposed to the argument, but it requires some nuance: The prevalence of drug use is low in relative terms, but that does not mean that the market is insignificant (after all, we are a country of 114 million people). In Mexico, according to my very imprecise calculations , about 15 tons of cocaine are consumed a year, which probably puts us among the ten or fifteen largest markets in the world in terms of volume. By some rough estimates I have made (I can't do a more precise analysis because there is no good pricing data), the value of the drug market in Mexico is around a billion dollars; not huge, but noting to laugh at either. More than one person would be willing to die and kill in order to control a piece of that market. There is no direct relationship between the size of an illegal market and the amount of violence that it generates. What matters is its specific characteristics. In particular, these include the visibility of the market and the number of transactions involved. The more visibility, the greater likelihood of confrontation over control of the market, and the more transactions, the more likely it is that some will go wrong (just by the law of large numbers). Large-scale trafficking is discreet and involves operations of hundreds of kilos or even tons, the retail market is chaotic and involves millions of transactions of one gram or less. Predictably, the second is much more violent than the first per the weight of each transaction. Because of this, size comparison does not tell us much about the level of violence associated with each. In calculating the connection between drugs and violence, prevalence of use matters less than changes in the absolute number of users. An additional user of cocaine, for example, may cause an increase of a hundred or more retail transactions in a year. As such, if there was an increase of 100,000 users of cocaine between 2008 and 2011, there were probably 10 million additional transactions. That might be enough to explain a significant part of the spike in violence in recent years. From the addictions survey we can infer the number of drug users, but not the size of the market, much less its evolution over time. To do this, we would need to know the average amount consumed by users and the various street prices of different drugs across time. The survey gives us some information about usage patterns, but almost nothing about prices. The pricing data of the ENA is notoriously bad; they are self-reported values, with very few observations (few users provide information on prices) and no adjustment for purity (it is not known if users are talking about 10, 50 or 90 percent pure cocaine when they mention a price). And in Mexico there is no alternative dataset (the information that I have used in the past is strictly anecdotal). So we do not know what has happened to the market in recent years. Consequently, it is entirely possible (I say possible, not certain) that it has surged due to high prices, even if the prevalence of drug use did not increase. With that, I'm not endorsing the theory that the domestic market is the main source of our violence. But it is clear that, by itself, the National Addiction Survey does not contradict it. In the link between between drugs and violence , size isn't the only thing that matters. * Translated and reprinted with permission from Alejandro Hope, of Plata o Plomo , a blog on the politics and economics of drugs and crime published by Animal Politico.

"FARC Take Out Radar in Biggest Recent Infrastructure Attack. Guerrillas from the FARC attacked a radar installation in the southwest province of Cauca, suggesting a concerted effort by the rebels to attack Colombia's infrastructure. The attack began on Friday night and lasted 15 hours with roughly 100 rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) using homemade explosives and gas cylinders to damage the installation, reported El Colombiano. The radar, which covers an area of 300 kilometers, served as a crucial tool for the Colombian air force in the monitoring of drug trafficking in the area. Repairs are expected to take several months to have the installation working again at full capacity. The Cano Limon oil pipeline which runs from the department of Arauca to the department of Sucre in Colombia's northeast was also bombed on Friday, with the attack being carried out by presumed FARC guerrillas. The assertion by President Juan Manuel Santos that attacks affecting the civilian population represent the group's "" weakness and desperation ,"" appear off the mark. The radar attack is the boldest move made yet by the FARC since its leader, Rodrigo Londono Echeverry, alias ""Timochenko,"" announced earlier this year that the group was willing to sit down to peace talks with the government. It is also one of the group's more significant moves against Colombian infrastructure in some time, as they have focused over the past year primarily on small-scale attacks on the security forces. The temporary dismantling of the radar station is likely to benefit the FARC economically as well as embolden them. Cauca is one the rebel group's strongholds and an area from which they traffic both cocaine and coca base. The elimination of a key monitoring instrument for the government will open the window for the group to traffic with comparative ease, knowing that government efforts will be hindered for some months while they get the radar working again. Cali airport has also been a key point for drug trafficking, as evidenced with the break-up of a trafficking ring last July that was sending between 700 kilograms and 2 tons to Central America and the US each month. With government resources held back, trafficking out of Cauca department from not only the FARC could be on the rise in the coming months. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Anti-Corruption Fight at Stake in Honduras Attorney General Selection. The selection process for the new attorney general in Honduras is already causing concern among civil society organizations due to a shortfall of candidates and the lack of time to choose a suitable replacement to continue the country's fight against corruption. On April 25, the Alliance for Peace and Justice (Alianza por la Paz y la Justicia - APJ) and the Association for a More Just Society (Asociacion para una Sociedad mas Justa - ASJ) organized a forum entitled "" For a Five-Star Attorney General ,"" which was attended by members of Honduran civil society including Jose Ugaz, former president of Transparency International, and Jorge Padilla, a representative of the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights (Instituto Interamericano de Derechos Humanos - IIDH). During the forum, the speakers described the profile they believed the next attorney general of Honduras should have, and demanded that authorities ensure transparency in the selection process as well as sufficient time to reach the best decision. ""We say to the Honduran political class that they have a responsibility not to elect too hastily. They must be conscious when choosing the person to hold the position,"" Padilla stated in comments reported by Proceso. The next attorney general of Honduras will be selected by the Congress before September. But first, the proposal group -- an entity comprised of seven members from judicial, academic and civil society institutions -- must nominate the five best candidates for the job. April 30 is the final day for the proposal group to register the list to be considered by the Congress. However, a few days before the deadline, only two candidates have been registered. According to Proceso, ASJ's Carlos Hernandez said that if there are not enough candidates before the deadline, the organization will ""demand that the proposal group extend the [enrollment] period to get the right number of people and allow them to make the best choice."" This is a decisive year for the future of the battle against corruption and organized crime in the Northern Triangle region of Central America, made up of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. All three countries will elect their attorneys general while a series of scandals and accusations dog their political and economic elites. In Honduras, the next attorney general's challenge will be to continue the work and investigations started by current Attorney General Oscar Chinchilla, who contributed to the arrests of important organized crime figures like the Valle Valle brothers and Hector Emilio Fernandez Rosa, alias ""Don H."" Chinchilla also helped to dismantle other support networks for drug trafficking organizations, as in the case of former president Porfirio Lobo's son Fabio Lobo , who was accused of collaborating with criminal group the Cachiros. Another case involved the same ex-president's wife, Rosa Elena de Lobo , who was arrested for embezzling nearly $600,000 a few days after her husband's term ended. Since then, some of the charges against her have been dismissed. The attorney general's task is far from easy. Pressure from the Honduran elite has even affected the internationally-backed Support Mission Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (Mision de Apoyo contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad en Honduras - MACCIH), which is supported by the Organization of American States (OAS). In February, the head of the MACCIH -- who had contributed to investigations into political figures allegedly involved in graft and drug trafficking -- resigned his post one month after congress passed a law that would interfere with the mission's investigations against an embezzlement ring made up of Honduran legislators. The next attorney general will have to face similar obstacles in which the political elite is pitted against anti-corruption efforts, which is why it is important for the chosen candidate to be suitable for the position, and independent -- a person who will not give in to the interests of politicians or organized crime."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Italian Mafia Cocaine Broker Arrested in Colombia. Authorities arrested a cocaine broker who acted as a link between Italy's mafia clans and Colombian cocaine suppliers, in perhaps the biggest blow yet to recently revived Colombia-Italy drug trafficking operations. Roberto Pannunzi, alias ""Bebe"" (Baby), was captured in a Bogota shopping center on July 5 and two days later extradited to Italy, where he is facing an outstanding conviction, reported El Tiempo. Pannunzi has been at the center of the cocaine trade between Colombia and Italy for over 30 years, and was one of the first Italians to establish links with Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel during the '80s cocaine boom. Although widely considered an integral figure in mafia drug interests, Pannunzi operated independently, serving as an intermediary for Italy's main cocaine traffickers in the 'Ndrangheta mafia clans, while also maintaining links with the Cosa Nostra , according to Italian prosecutors , who labeled him the ""biggest cocaine importer in the world."" Pannunzi was renowned as a skilled diplomat, who pioneered a cooperative approach to cocaine trafficking by convincing distinct and sometimes antagonistic criminal organizations to pool resources to buy shipments, which he would then transport to Europe. Authorities believe he was operating primarily in Colombia and Venezuela but also had connections to Mexican drug trafficking organizations. Pannunzi has been arrested twice before, once in Colombia in 1994, and then again in Spain in 2004. The first time, he was freed because he could no longer legally be held on remand. The second time, he escaped from a hospital after complaining of health problems. Pannunzi's capture is the latest in a series of arrests of Italian mafia figures in Colombia. So far this year, Iacomino Tomasso , who organized cocaine shipments for the La Camorra mafia, and Santo Scipione and Domenico Trimboli , who worked with the 'Ndrangheta, have also been captured. However, with his long history and broad network of contacts, Pannunzi's capture may prove to be the most significant. Authorities believe the recent arrests are indicative of a surge in Italy-Colombia drug trafficking operations, which they say are a result of mafia figures released from prison looking to re-establish old connections. However, with Italian mafia groups having also established relations with Mexican cartels over the last decade, it could be that their return to Colombia is also driven by a desire to control the cocaine trade closer to the source. Arguably, Colombia has also become a more appealing country for independent drug traffickers, as its fractured underworld has created more space for those looking to establish their own drug trafficking connections."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Economic Development and Organized Crime: The Two Faces of Uraba, Colombia. The Gulf of Uraba boasts 323 kilometers of porous, thick, and deep coast dominated by the whim of the so-called Gaitanista Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, also known as the Urabenos; today, contraband, cocaine, migrants, as well as heavy machinery moving through the area is giving shape to a deepwater port yearning for government leadership. On the same day that a group of land claimants gathered in the town of Apartado, in the Uraba region of the department of Antioquia, to discuss their security fears regarding the control that the Urabenos had achieved over the area, two police officers were attacked in cold blood by hitmen on mortorcycles in the neighboring municipality of Carepa, only a few kilometers away. The incident, which occured at approximately two in the afternoon in the populous San Marino neighborhood of the urban center, left one officer dead and the other injured. Only 24 hours earlier, a police station located near Piedras Blancas, also in Carepa, had been harassed by unknown persons. *This story was translated, edited for clarity and length, and published with permission from Verdad Abierta. It does not necessarily represent the views of InSight Crime. See the Spanish original here. The truth, however, does not actually involve unknown persons. In Uraba, civilian and military authorities know that those responsible for these incidents are none other than the ""gaitanistas,"" which the the national government refers to as the ""Gulf Clan"" (""Clan del Golfo"") and which InSight Crime refers to as the Urabenos. In the region, these individuals are simply known as the ""paracos"" (""paramilitaries""), and they have merchants, farmers, officials, and communities living in a state of terror. According to Colonel Luis Eduardo Soler, chief of the Uraba police department, the recent attacks against his men are retaliation from members of this criminal organization in response to the success of Operation Agamemnon. The most recent operation, as recalled by the official, took place on May 3, when there was an armed confrontation between police officers and various ""gaitanistas"" in the village of Los Guaduales in the rural zone of Necocli. Ulder Cardona Rueda, alias ""Pablito,"" for whom authorities had offered a reward of 150 million pesos, was killed in combat during the operation, as were three of his bodyguards. Alias ""Pablito"" was considered by judicial investigators to be one of the most bloodthirsty members of the Urabenos. He was responsible for the finances of the organizational structures involved in crimes in Cordoba and Antioquia's Uraba region. After alias ""Otoniel"" and alias ""Gavilan,"" he was also the most important member of this criminal organization operating in the northern corner of the country. Historical records show that in September 2005 he, along with 1,135 other paramilitaries of the Centauros Bloc of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), demobilized in the Tilodiran district of Yopal, Casanare. Without doubt, his death was a great trophy for police officers, who since then have patrolled the area in caravans of up to two, three, and even four motorcycles, all wearing thick bulletproof vests -- an image that the inhabitants of Uraba Antioquia are growing accustomed to, just as they have grown accustomed to seeing motorcycle officers escorting beer and soda delivery vehicles. The decision to accompany these vehicles was made following the burning of three cars on the same day in mid-January. The first of these, a soda distributor, was incinerated in the very center of Carepa; the other two were transporting beer on the road from Mutata to Belen de Baijira. The incidents, as explained at the time by the Uraba police department, were retaliation from the ""gaitanistas"" for non-payment of extortion. The fear of extortion among the inhabitants of Uraba is nothing new, with this phenomenon being present for many years. In municipalities like Chigorodo, Carepa, Apartado, Turbo, and Necocli, reports of extortion have reached dramatic levels. Formal and informal merchants and transporters, other local public contractors, and even those who exploit the region's wealth of wood or seek to smuggle and engage in other illicit activities in the port must all pay the ""gaitanistas."" ""Unfortunately we have a high underreporting of extortion, because people do not denounce these activities. The best way to prevent and attack this crime is in this way, having citizens report incidents. One hundred percent of cases reported are resolved positively. But the people do not do it,"" explains the chief of the Uraba police in relation to a scourge that is only growing day by day. The Best Corner of America The 323 kilometers extending through all the Gulf of Uraba makes Antioquia the department with the second-most coastline on the Caribbean after La Guajira, a geostrategic privilege that the political and trade union leadership has been unable to fully take advantage of -- until now. After many decades of failed promises, the Antioquia Port Society (Sociedad Puerto Antioquia), has begun to realize the dream of a deepwater port in the Uraba region with an investment of $350 million. The project began this year in the Nueva Colonia district of Turbo, and it is expected to generate 1,800 jobs directly to the region. This is not the only large infrastructure project currently in the works in what is considered the ""best corner of America."" Since 2015, sections of double-lane roads have been constructed in the municipality of Chigordodo-Carepa-Apartado-El Tres, in the district of Turbo. This is in addition to the initiation of work on road projects Mar I, which provides for the construction of double-lane roads between Dabeiba and Mutata, and Mar II, which will improve the connectivity between Santafe de Antioquia and Mutata through the construction of sections of double-lane roads and a tunnel at the height of the site known as El Toyo. With their completion, the 12 and upward-hour overland drive from Medellin to Apartado will be reduced to five hours, meaning that the exit to the sea will be substantially shortened, which has several implications in terms of competitiveness. ""It means that it will be cheaper distributing merchandise through the port of Turbo rather than through Barranquilla and Buenaventura and that Uraba will now be under scrutiny from the rest of the country,"" says Carepa Government Secretary Camilo Calle. According to estimates from the official, Uraba will go from having a population of almost 650,000 to a little over a million in the next four years as a result of these projects as well as the consolidation of the banana industry, which currently covers 34,267 hectares in the area and saw export volumes of 68 million boxes in 2015. But this wave of progress and development has occurred without the region resolving the problems that have marked its history, such as land tenure, for example. Six years after the implementation of Law 1448, also known as the Law of Victims and Land Restitution, courts have managed to resolve only 176 out of 890 cases filed before land tribunals. These decisions have resulted in a total of 6,143 hectares returned to rightful owners. For Elkin Rocha, director of the Special Administrative Unit for Land Restitution (Unidad de Restitucion de Tierras - URT) in Uraba, the process of restitution is proceeding at a good pace and could improve even further when a new group of nine judges designated to handle land tenure cases specifically in Uraba take office. ""We will have three to four judges more. Without doubt it will help resolve many cases,"" assured the official, who additionally explained that out of 19,448 applications filed to date in the various offices of the URT in Antioquia, only 7,109 correspond to Uraba. However, from the point of view of organizations like Forging Futures (Forjando Futuros), which legally accompanies victims of land deprivation in Uraba, the resulting balance of land restitutions in Uraba is very poor, because the land returned to farm workers via judicial sentences so far only represents four percent of the total usurped land in the region: 150,000 hectares. This does not even take into account how the security situation for farmer land claimants, even those that have actually benefitted from restitution cases, is increasingly becoming more complex. Claimants Cornered Everything was jubilation and hope among the 106 claimant families on the Paquemas area of Turbo in the year that the courts not only recognized their condition as victims of one of the most significant dispossession of lands committed in the region, but also returned their usurped lands. Between 2014 and 2015, the land tribunals issued 22 sentences in which legitimate owners were returned 37 of the 87 farms currently in legal dispute. The cases involve farms that were first abandoned by peasants in 1995 who, fleeing from the paramilitary offensive being led by Herbert Veloza Garcia, alias ""HH,"" had no other option than the forced exodus. Then came the land dispossession. A public official, taking advantage of the fear that prevailed throughout the region, forced the peasants though deceit and threats to give up their land titles, nothing more than adjudication pronouncements issued by the Colombian Agrarian Reform Institute (Instituto Colombiano de la Reforma Agraria - INCORA) in November 1994. ""Here there is a grave dilemma: they are exploiting a state of fear. The paramilitaries are the ones that control this business. And since nobody can say anything, then the productive projects for the families that have returned are vulnerable Curiously, the land ended up in the hands of powerful landowners and ranchers who converted the plots of land into imposing livestock businesses. According to the accounts of claimants who spoke to VerdadAbierta.com, these livestock businesses are now furiously opposed to the restitution process, even ignoring judicial decisions. ""The cases are concrete: since the families that have returned still have these opponents as their neighbors, the opponents dump cattle in their land to harm their productive projects; they constantly run through the fences dividing the lands; they poison their animals. And who says anything if the law of the land is the paramilitaries?"" says a farmer in the region, who asked for his identity to remain anonymous. The worries do not stop there. According to the farmer, various leaders of the land claimants in the Paquemas area have received death threats in the past few months. Since the courts have yet to rule on the rest of the usurped land, there is a total state of uncertainty between those who returned to the area and those who hope to regain what the war stripped away. ""Here there is a grave dilemma: they are exploiting a state of fear. The paramilitaries are the ones that control this business. And since nobody can say anything, then the productive projects for the families that have returned are vulnerable, because occasionally they are laid waste to, befouled, and totally destroyed,"" the source added. The view by the land claimants is that ""things are tending to get worse."" A few kilometers from there, in the Macondo district of Turbo, the reality is not much different. Presently, there are 600 families that have decided to return since 2012 at their own peril to what they consider to be legitimately theirs. And peril is indeed what they have faced. Over the last two years, attacks against those that have returned have intensified: their ranches are destroyed, their animals and water sources are poisoned, or their women and children are intimidated. Additionally, the most visible leaders receive threatening calls warning them that they will soon face a ""pistol plan"" (""plan pistola""). The assassination of Porfirio Jaramillo, a farmer who was claiming lands in the Guacamayas area of Macondo, on January 28 has stoked fears that said plan is a reality. Several recognized peasant leaders have been left with no option but to abandon the region. The situation is just as complicated in territories like the neighborhood council La Larga-Tumarado, on the edge of the Choco Department. There, spokespersons for Afro-Colombian communities denounce how the ""gaitanistas"" can impose restrictions on them and patrol the territory with the same liberty that the paramilitaries in the service of Fredy Rendon Herrera, alias ""El Aleman"" once did. According to them, nobody can enter this vast territory without the ""gaitanistas"" being made aware. The view by the land claimants is that ""things are tending to get worse."" The courts have turned a deaf ear to their protests, and the threats, attacks, and homicides continue without a response. Opponents of the Victims' Law have intensified their smear campaign against the URT and the land claimants, and their diatribes have begun to be accepted by local politicians. In the midst of all this, there has been an increase in reported incidents of abuses committed by ranch foremen, who take advantage of the ever-growing ""gaitanista"" control. ""The 'gaitanistas' have people scattered about in all the entrances to the districts and regions who are called 'points.' They pay attention to who goes in and comes out. It happens that sometimes the police enter the area to inspect how everything is. And they take longer to leave than it takes the so-called 'points' to come and ask us what we told the police. This is how control works around here,"" said a farmer land claimant of Guacamayas. 'An Offensive with Results to Show' ""They are not paramilitaries,"" said Colonel Luis Eduardo Soler, chief of the Uraba police department, without hesitation in response to a question about how his institution refers to members of the Urabenos. To him, this is a criminal organization that includes combatants from the extinct AUC, drug traffickers, the criminal elements that already existed in the region, and even individuals of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC); an organization that wants to demonstrate armed strength with a pseudo political discourse, ""perhaps to one day pressure the government into a negotiation."" ""The group's principal activity is narcotrafficking. And it has to their advantage a coast of more than 300 kilometers that, regardless of how much we try, is difficult to control. Everything moves through there,"" explained Colonel Soler. However, he also added that the expansion of extortion and indiscriminate attacks against police officers ""only goes to show how desperate the group is; it is feeling the pressure, knowing it is cornered and that its members cannot move around like they used to."" According to him, this is a consequence of the controversial Operation Agamemnon, a giant police operation that is seeking the capture of Dairo Antonio Usuga David, alias ""Otoniel,"" the top leader of the Urabenos as well as the dismantling of the organization. Its most important results to date have been the seizure of more than 85 tons of cocaine that were ready for export and the capture of 1,300 members of this organization, including various local leaders and middle-ranking members. Given all this, the question asked in Uraba today is: why have officials been unable to capture ""Otoniel,"" despite so much police deployment in the region, and, moreover, why does the organization actually appear stronger? There is one thing that analysis by civilian and police authorities agree on in relation to the Urabenos: they have become one of the biggest employers in the region and have been able to build solid support networks by gaining the support of communities and recruiting mainly from family members. ""In many places the group is seen as a 'Robin Hood.' It helps the lady take her child to the doctor; if a family does not have a market to sell to it buys from them. It hires motorbike taxis to gain the support of the people. To that, it must be added that certainly many of them are family; they are not called the 'Usuga Clan' for nothing,"" says a Carepa City Hall official, who is likewise concerned about the growth in some municipalities of Uraba of something directly related to this criminal organization: small-scale drug trafficking. ""There has been an increase in the consumption of psychoactive substances, something that is becoming a public health problem,"" the official said. And not only that, the phenomenon of gangs has spread like wildfire in shanty towns in Carepa, Turbo, and Apartado with all its known consequences: an increase in fights with bladed weapons and other scourges like glassbreakers. ""These individuals become addicted, then they are put to sell drugs, and if they prove their fineness, then they are incorporated into the organization,"" the source added. So is the state of Uraba today: a region that shows two completely contradictory faces. On one side, it is becoming one of the most important mercantile, financial, and real estate development hubs in the country; on the other, organized crime still bares its fangs and continues to consolidate at the expense of institutional strengthening. *This story was translated, edited for clarity and length, and published with permission from Verdad Abierta.

Drug Lords Family Claim Prison Mistreatment. In stark contrast to recent stories about Mexican drug lords enjoying luxury lifestyles in their prison cells, the family of imprisoned capo Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, alias 'El Padrino,' have written an open letter complaining that the 67-year-old is being held in inhumane conditions. Reportedly published as an almost full-page advert in various Mexico City newspapers, the letter states that Felix Gallardo is kept isolated from other inmates, prevented from doing exercise, and held in cells that are unhealthy, foul-smelling and dark. As punishment for smoking cigarettes, his right to personal visits was allegedly suspended last month. According to the letter, the one-time godfather of Mexico's drug cartels is being denied access to medical treatment for his cataracts, deafness, ulcers and a hernia. Credited with establishing the foundations of Mexico's present-day drug business, Felix Gallardo was the top leader of the Guadalajara Cartel in the 1980s, and is behind the creation of today's notorious Sinaloa Cartel. The kingpin was arrested in 1989 and is currently serving a 40-year sentence for drug-trafficking, bribery and weapons offenses at the maximum security Altiplano Prison just outside Mexico City. The complaints about his alleged mistreatment stand out from a raft of stories about Mexico's cartel heads continuing to run their enterprises from behind bars, keeping up their opulent lifestyles, and even breaking out altogether. With an influx of inmates from President Calderon's crackdown on the cartels, prisons throughout the country are increasingly overcrowded and suffer from a lack of security and corrupt staff. It was reported last month that Felix Gallardo's niece Avila Beltran, also known as 'La Reina del Pacifico,' received plastic surgery and botox injections while imprisoned at the Santa Martha Acatitla woman's prison. How someone managed to deliver these services and get past security with the necessary equipment is a mystery. Sinaloa Cartel head Joaquin Guzman Loera , alias 'El Chapo,' likewise lived the high life inside jail, with conjugal visits from various females and specially prepared meals, before escaping in 2001. Mexico has also seen a number of audacious prison breaks in recent months, with one of the biggest taking place in December 2010 when 151 inmates were freed from a prison close to Nuevo Laredo. This was allegedly organized by drug cartel the Zetas. Some prisoners are apparently allowed to break out and then return again - in July 2010 there were reports that guards in a prison in Durango, northwest Mexico, had let prisoners leave the facility in order to carry out contract killings ordered by cartels. Ironically, Felix Gallardo himself reportedly kept control of Mexico's drug trade for many years after his arrest, coordinating activities from his jail via cell phone. Prison security and corruption within penitentiaries is a rising concern across the region. In Guatemala, operations organized from behind bars were blamed for the explosion of a bus in January. Meanwhile in El Salvador authorities are working on measures to block cell phone signals around prisons due to the number of hits that are being ordered by capos from within jails. Mexico is reportedly developing similar plans. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Why Did the US Release One of Guatemalas Biggest Drug Traffickers?Records show that the United States quietly released Guatemala kingpin Otto Herrera nearly a year ago, hinting at the possibility that the cocaine trafficker has struck a deal with authorities. According to the US Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) website , Otto Herrera Garcia - once one of the most-wanted drug traffickers in the world before his extradition to the US in 2008 - was released from prison on October 8, 2013. Although the release occurred nearly a year ago, it was just recently brought into the public eye by Guatemalan news website Soy502. A BOP spokesman told the website that Herrera had been ""freed from his sentence,"" but that it was possible he was still in the custody of another government agency. A US Department of Justice (DOJ) spokesman, meanwhile, told Soy502 there was no information ""publicly available"" about Herrera's current location. Prensa Libre reported that Guatemalan authorities planned to request information from the US about the early release. Herrera, a Guatemalan national, was arrested in Colombia in 2007 and extradited to the United States in February 2008 on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. As of 2011, the BOP reported he was due to be released in 2017, according to Soy502. In 2004, the USDOJ called Herrera ""one of the biggest drug traffickers in Central America."" His organization served as an intermediary between the remains of Colombia's Cali Cartel and Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. According to the US Department of State (DOS) , he was responsible for transporting more than 18 tons of cocaine up through Central America and Mexico into the US beginning in 1998. Case records show he also sent millions of dollars in wire transfers from Mexico to the United States, some of which was used to buy airplanes from a US company. He has been linked to Guatemalan businessman and political broker Gustavo Herrera (not related), who allegedly helped Otto Herrera's organization move and store drug shipments. Herrera has proved a slippery figure: in 2004, he was captured in Mexico, but while the United States was busy developing an extradition request, Herrera quietly snuck out of jail disguised as a policeman, after paying off prison staff. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) refused to comment on Herrera's case to InSight Crime when consulted in an interview about Guatemalan crime dynamics last March. However, the brevity of the time he spent in US prison may have been the result of a deal with authorities, in which he provided information in exchange for an early release. Cooperation deals are common for extradited drug traffickers, and if this is indeed what happened, Herrera is likely just one of many Guatemalan traffickers who will follow this path. Other possibilities include Horst Walther Overdick , Otto Turcios and Walter Montejo (at least two of whom were allegedly linked to Herrera and, incidentally, were arrested during his time in the US)."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Supreme Court Labels Street Gangs as Terrorist Groups. El Salvador's top court has reclassified the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Barrio 18 street gangs as terrorist organizations, in what appears to be an official declaration of war and a green light for the further militarization of domestic security. On August 24, El Salvador's Supreme Court declared the MS13 and Barrio 18 -- along with any other criminal organizations that violate the fundamental rights of the population or seek to usurp state power -- to be terrorist groups, reported the AP. The Supreme Court based its ruling on the gangs' systemic and organized use of violence, such as a recent gang-enforced transportation strike. In the same ruling, the judges rejected multiple lawsuits seeking to declare elements of El Salvador's anti-terrorism laws as unconstitutional. The laws provide for harsher sentencing of MS13 and Barrio 18 members, including 10 to 15 year prison terms for gang leaders convicted under terrorism charges. In addition to gang members, the court's ruling categorized gang ""collaborators, apologists, and financiers"" as terrorists, according to La Prensa Grafica. The move comes as El Salvador's security crisis continues to worsen and police-gang confrontations increase. August -- with 539 homicides through its first 20 days -- has a higher daily average homicide rate (almost 27) of any month so far in 2015. Furthermore, 44 police have been killed this year , eclipsing the 39 murdered in all of 2014. While El Salvador's desperate security situation calls for creative solutions , the Supreme Court's de facto endorsement of a militarized response is likely to invite abuse, while improving little. Indeed, labeling gang members and their suspected associates as terrorists adds to the government's increasingly warlike rhetoric -- despite scant evidence that militarized security solutions reduce violence. This further lends itself to the possibility of human rights abuses by authorities. The nation's security forces have already been accused of carrying out extrajudicial massacres and brutalizing suspected gang members , making little distinction between gang members and civilians in police round-ups. Salvadoran legislators have also considered giving authorities increased wiretapping powers , and in May President Salvador Sanchez Ceren announced heavily-armed military brigades would be deployed onto El Salvador's streets. On top of increasing the potential for abuse, the new terrorist label may also backfire in other ways. For instance, NGOs and international organizations working with at-risk youth in El Salvador's gang-controlled areas or helping current gang members leave their criminal life may now potentially be labeled as terrorists, thereby inhibiting their important work."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Former Mayor Who Exposed Narco-Political Links in Paraguay Captured. A former mayor in eastern Paraguay, accused of ordering the killing of an investigative journalist, has been arrested in Brazil, in a case that detonated a narco-politics scandal in this landlocked South American nation. On March 4, Brazilian police arrested Vilmar ""Neneco"" Acosta in Mato Grosso state near the Paraguayan border, reported Vanguardia. Acosta is the former mayor of the town of Ypejhu in eastern Paraguay and is accused of ordering the murder of journalist Pablo Medina in October 2014. He had reported on links between Acosta, his family, and drug traffickers in the region. Paraguay's Attorney General Javier Diaz Veron said authorities are seeking to extradite the former mayor. A judge in Brazil has revoked Acosta's Brazilian citizenship because the suspect reportedly obtained a false birth certificate in that country, paving the way for extradition proceedings to begin. Acosta was previously arrested in February 2011 after authorities found human bones and hair on his father's property in Ypejhu. He was released less than one month later, however, and the judges who freed him were subsequently found guilty of judicial irregularities in the case. Acosta's capture is significant because the murder of Medina precipitated Paraguay's current narco-political scandal. The unprecedented media attention -- spearheaded by Medina's employer, ABC Color -- on the undue influence of drug trafficking groups on Paraguayan institutions has exposed some long-standing official corruption in the country. Paraguay regularly ranks among Latin America's most corrupt nations in Transparency International's annual Corruption Perceptions index, and in 2014 trailed only Venezuela and Haiti. For years, Brazilian drug trafficking groups have bought political protection in eastern Paraguay, the country's most prolific marijuana-producing region. It supplies several consumer markets in South America including Brazil, Chile, and Argentina. Shortly after Medina's assassination, anti-drug czar Luis Rojas stated drug trafficking groups were using their economic influence to subvert political and judicial institutions in Paraguay. In December 2014, several congressmen were linked to high-level Brazilian and Paraguayan drug traffickers , including Carlos Antonio Caballero, alias ""Capilo."" In 2015, revelations of corruption have extended to Paraguay's security forces. In January, ABC Color revealed police officers in eastern Canindeyu province regularly received bribes from drug traffickers, and in February a military captain was arrested for running a transnational drug trafficking network ."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Mexico Armed Forces See 45,000 Deserters in 5 Years. Nearly 45,000 soldiers and marines have deserted the Mexican Armed Forces since President Felipe Calderon took office in 2006 and deployed the military in the fight against organized crime. The number of deserters, some 40,000 of them from the army , represents a significant decrease compared to the previous administrations. Calderon pointed out that the number of deserters in his five years in power was around half of that seen during the six-year presidency of predecessor Vicente Fox. The president credited the reduction in desertion rates to the fact that the troops were motivated, and to his administration's focus on improving their quality of life, providing increased salaries and loans for housing. According to the president, there are currently investigations underway against 1,382 of those who deserted. The armed forces saw 105 troops killed between the start of Calderon's presidency and June 2011, according to figures given to Milenio newspaper. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Torture by Security Forces on Rise in Calderons Mexico. A report by a French campaign group warns that torture and human rights violations committed by the Mexican security forces have risen dramatically since President Felipe Calderon launched his war against organized crime. On June 25, a French non-governmental organization, the Action Group of Christians for the Abolition of Torture (ACAT-France), released a report alleging that Mexican security forces committed an increasing number of serious human rights abuses between 2006, when Calderon came to office, and 2011. ACAT-France's report, ""In the Name of the 'War against Crime': A Study of the Torture Phenomenon in Mexico,"" presented a stark view of Calderon's assault on the drug cartels, which ACAT-France blamed for much of the abuse. The report cited various studies estimating that during Calderon's presidency, between 3,000 and 10,000 people were ""disappeared"" by criminal groups or government forces. According to the report, the national human rights commission (CNDH) received six reports of torture in 2006, which went up to 42 last year. ACAT-France explained the most serious cases of torture often took place in the first few hours after arrest, including asphyxiation, water-boarding, electric shock, and sexual abuse. The report also noted the high level of impunity for abuses. Fearing reprisal, few victims came forward -- the study estimated the rate to be some 10 percent. Moreover, the study claimed that officials were hesitant to investigate abuse allegations because they could reflect badly on the government. The report demonstrates the unintended consequences of Mexico's ""war against crime."" According to ACAT-France, people were arbitrarily detained and tortured to extract forced confessions so that Mexican officials and security officers could make themselves appear successful in fighting crime. The report noted that this policy that not only hurt civilians, but also created a fabricated understanding of the reality of crime in Mexico. It is unclear whether Mexico's president-elect, Enrique Pena Nieto, will reduce human rights violations. Pena Nieto stated that he would prioritize lowering violent crime over fighting trafficking, which might decrease the pressure on the security forces to inflate their reports of those arrested for involvement in organized crime. He has also discussed in vague terms the need to reform the justice system. Although it remains to be seen whether the president elect will follow through with his promises, it is possible that reports like this one will create pressure for reform. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Mexican Local Police Kidnapped by Fellow Officers, Tortured. Five municipal police who were found drunk in a bar in Durango state after being reported missing days earlier now say that state police kidnapped them and handed them over to a group who tortured them and forced them to drink alcohol. Five municipal police from the town of Lerdo, Durango, including the police chief, disappeared on October 15, prompting the mayor to initiate a search for them. On the morning of October 18, the missing police were found, inebriated, in a bar in the state capital. At that time, the state attorney general, Sonia Yadira de la Garza, told La Jornada that none gave any indication of having been taken against their will. After returning to Lerdo, however, the five men held a press conference in the mayor's office and said that on October 15 they were intercepted by state police, questioned about linkages to organized crime and then taken, blindfolded and handcuffed, to an unknown location, reported Milenio. The state police then handed them off to a group of men who tortured them, forced them to drink alcohol, and then dropped them at the bar where they were later found, they said. One of the men has been hospitalized for second and third degree burns, and the others showed the press injuries such as bruises, ligature marks, and burns reportedly made by a blowtorch (see video, below). In an interview with Milenio after the press conference, a spokesman for Durango's Secretariat of Public Security (SSP) echoed the attorney general's original statement that the men had not reported any injuries to state authorities, but promised a full investigation. If the officers' account is true, it illustrates the enormous challenges faced by Mexico's municipal police. While local police forces in Mexico have a well-deserved reputation for corruption , their jobs are extremely difficult: they are often poorly paid, hopelessly outgunned , and thus vulnerable to pressure or violent reprisals from criminal groups. The use of abusive methods to root out corrupt police officers has also been reported in Tijuana, where municipal police chief Julian Leyzaola was accused of overseeing the abduction and torture of officers suspected of links with drug gangs.	0	1	0	0	1	0	0
Army Failure Casts Doubt Over Paraguays Anti-EPP Efforts. Paraguay's EPP guerrillas have killed a soldier for the first time after a military operation spectacularly backfired, raising the question of whether the new government has the capacity to wage the war it has declared on the rebels. On December 8, a joint task force consisting of army and police personnel was ambushed by a guerrilla cell from the Paraguay People's Army (EPP) as they prepared what was supposed to be a surprise attack against the same cell. The attack -- in the Horqueta district of the state of Concepcion -- left one soldier dead and another seriously wounded , with the estimated five guerrillas escaping unharmed. Preliminary reports on the operation suggest that barking dogs and other noises gave away the position of the security forces, allowing the EPP cell to pack away their camp and circle back on the unit. The day after the assault, Interior Minister Francisco De Vargas admitted the operation had been a tactical failure but said they had no information regarding rumors the guerrillas had been tipped off and refused to comment on suggestions of tensions between the military and the police. The killing brings the total number of dead attributed to EPP violence to 33 since 2005, but all previous victims have been police or civilians, reported EFE. Until recently, taking on the EPP had been tasked to the police and not the armed forces. This has changed under the Presidency of Horacio Cartes, who has used his first 100 days in office to militarize anti-guerrilla efforts as part of a frontal assault against the rebels. Cartes' policies have included passing reforms to the National Defense Law that granted him direct power over military deployments, which he said would allow him to react more efficiently to the threat of the EPP. However, the operation on Sunday, which EFE reported was the first time the military has directly led an attack on the EPP, raises concerns over whether the military has the resources and training required to effectively carry out counter-insurgency operations.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Mexico Organized Crime-Related Executions Hit Record High: Report. Executions linked to organized crime in Mexico have risen to record levels during the first six months of 2018, according to a new report, underscoring how shifting criminal dynamics continue to negatively impact levels of violence in the country. A record 11,241 executions linked to organized crime groups in Mexico were recorded during the first six months of 2018, an average of more than 60 per day and a 28 percent increase from the same period last year, according to a new report from the watchdog agency Semaforo Delictivo and Lantia Consultores, a non-profit that tracks killings connected to organized crime. (Graphic courtesy of Semaforo Delictivo and Lantia Consultores) The 310 percent increase in homicides in the Pacific state of Nayarit compared to the same time period last year was the highest in Mexico. This was followed by a 134 percent increase in the Caribbean state of Quintana Roo and a 130 percent increase in the central state of Guanajuato. (Graphic courtesy of Semaforo Delictivo and Lantia Consultores) On the other hand, northwestern Baja California Sur state, which was hit by a wave of violence in 2017, recorded a 52 percent decrease in homicides throughout the first half of 2018 compared to last year. The Pacific state of Sinaloa, home to the notorious Sinaloa Cartel, saw the next biggest decrease with a 28 percent reduction in homicides. Lantia Consultores used their own methodology by collecting reports and using media coverage to gather the data on organized crime-related executions. They counted the total number of victims of organized crime as opposed to how Mexico's National Public Security System (Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Publica - SNSP) counts just the total number of homicide cases. The bloody start to 2018 comes after Mexico set record highs for homicides and organized crime-related homicides in 2017. Mexico's criminal landscape has grown increasingly fragmented in recent years, and the shake up of the country's underworld has had a severe impact on levels of violence. The significant increase in homicides in Nayarit and Guanajuato states, which both border Jalisco state, the stronghold of the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion - CJNG), is likely linked to a struggle for criminal control. As InSight Crime recently reported , a splinter group of the CJNG known as the Nueva Plaza is battling the CJNG in and around the Jalisco capital of Guadalajara for control over criminal economies. At the moment, the Nueva Plaza has won control over the western part of the city while the group continues to battle the CJNG for control over several towns to the southeast of the city. "" There is an ongoing conflict between the CJNG, Nueva Plaza and components of the Sinaloa Cartel in that area ,"" Mike Vigil, the former Chief of International Operations at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), told InSight Crime. However, the significant decrease in homicides in Baja California Sur and Sinaloa suggests that criminal dynamics may have started to settle in other parts of the country. According to Vigil, the Tijuana Cartel has stabilized its control over the Tijuana drug trafficking corridor along the US-Mexico border, which could explain the drop in homicides starting this year. But Vigil told InSight Crime this "" doesn't mean that in the future some of the other cartels won't move into the area, which could immediately act as a catalyst for more wholesale violence."" ""They can go from passive to volatile in a matter of minutes,"" he added. Indeed, the report found that homicides in neighboring Baja California rose more than 25 percent during the first half of 2018."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Major Colombia Bust Latest Example of Italy Mafia Presence. A Spanish citizen belonging to Italy's 'Ndrangheta mafia has been arrested and four tons of cocaine seized in Colombia, in the latest illustration of the Italian organized crime group's presence in Latin America. Hermenegildo Ventura Casan, who was arrested in the Atlantic port city of Cartagena on May 15, reportedly served as a link between the European criminal group and the Medellin-based Oficina de Envigado. According to a press release from the Colombian national police ( pdf ), he oversaw an international drug trafficking network that used Cartagena as the departure point for a route passing through Panama, Costa Rica, Spain and Italy. According to the release, the drugs were smuggled in containers with recyclable and industrial raw materials, which were shipped with documentation from false export businesses. Among Ventura's alleged contacts within the Oficina were the extradited leader of the group, Diego Fernando Murillo, alias ""Don Berna,"" and other key leaders. The 52-year-old Spaniard is also believed to have maintained contacts within Colombia's dominant criminal group, the Urabenos. Ventura's arrest comes after international police body Interpol issued a ""red notice"" (international arrest warrant) for the Spaniard, who is also being investigated by authorities in the United States. He is currently being held in capital Bogota, awaiting extradition to Spain. Fourteen other people were captured during the operation. Italy's 'Ndrangheta, which is thought to control 80 percent of the cocaine entering Italy, has shown signs of a resurgence in Latin America in recent years. As well as being active in Colombia, they reportedly receive cocaine supplies from Mexico's Zetas and are known to have established a trafficking route between Guyana and the United States. The arrest of Ventura comes only weeks after authorities in the Dominican Republic captured another 'Ndrangheta mobster who was reportedly working on establishing a new drug trafficking route through the Caribbean. According to international intelligence agencies consulted by InSight Crime, the Spanish city of Barcelona has now become a central negotiating point between Colombian and European mafias, which may explain Casan's Spanish origins and reported integration into the Italian group, despite the importance of blood ties. The use of a non-Italian middleman could also be intended to lower the profile of the 'Ndrangheta's activities in the region."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
"United States Congress: ATF Investigation on Operation Fast and Furious. On July 5, 2011, the House of Representatives of the U.S. Congressional Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Committee on the Judiciary sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, a day after holding a meeting with acting Director of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Kenneth Melson. During the interview, which he held voluntarily, Melson agreed that during the Operation ""Fast and Furious"" serious mistakes were made. ""Fast and Furious"" was an ATF-led investigation that attempted to track the sale of automatic rifles and other weapons from the point of purchase to the point of lethal use in Mexico. The operation has been criticized for allowing hundreds of weapons to ""walk,"" i.e., cross the border into Mexico, where they were used for criminal acts by the most powerful drug trafficking organization in the hemisphere, the Sinaloa Cartel, including the death of a U.S. border patrol agent in a shootout along the Mexico-U.S. border. An excerpt of the letter: According to Mr. Melson, he and ATF's senior leadership team moved to reassign every manager involved in Fast and Furious, from the Deputy Assistant Director for Field Operations down to the Group Supervisor, after learning the facts in those documents. Mr. Melson also said he was not allowed to communicate to Congress the reasons for the reassignments. He claimed that ATF's senior leadership would have preferred to be more cooperative with our inquiry much earlier in the process. However, he said that Justice Department officials directed them not to respond and took full control of replying to briefing and document requests from Congress. The result is that Congress only got the parts of the story that the Department wanted us to hear. If his account is accurate, then ATF leadership appears to have be en effectively muzzled while the DOJ sent over false denials and buried its head in the sand. That approach distorted the truth and obstructed our investigation. The Department's inability or unwillingness to be more forthcoming served to conceal critical information that we are now learning about the involvement of other agencies, including the DEA and the FBI. () The evidence we have gathered raises the *disturbing possibility that the *Justice*Department not only allowed criminals to smuggle weapons but that taxpayer dollars from other agencies may have financed those engaging in such activities. While this is*preliminary information, we must find out if there is any truth to it. According to Acting Director Melson, he became aware of this startling possibility only after the murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and the indictments of the straw purchasers, which we now know were substantially delayed by the U.S. Attorney's Office and Main Justice. Mr. Melson provided documents months ago supporting his concerns to the official in the ODAG responsible for document production to the Committees, but those documents have not been provided to us.

"Will Urabenos Break Peace Among Ecuadors Crime Groups?Colombia's principal criminal organization, the Urabenos, have marked their arrival in Ecuador with a series of killings, kidnappings and extortion of rivals as they look to establish a firm foothold in a country that is now a hub of global organized crime. In recent months, Ecuadorean authorities have linked several large cocaine seizures to the Urabenos , the first time the group has been publically identified as operating in Ecuador. However, intelligence reports obtained by El Comercio link the narco-paramilitary group to a series of drug related murders carried out last year in the Province of Los Rios. The reports also suggest the Urabenos have been targeting networks linked to rival groups in Ecuador with kidnappings and extortion, and by seizing their cash, vehicles and properties, as they try to establish dominion and edge out rivals. According to Colombian Police Chief Jose Roberto Leon, Ecuador was also one of the countries that renowned drug trafficker and leading member of the Urabenos Henry de Jesus Lopez, alias ""Mi Sangre,"" passed through after fleeing Colombia. Mi Sangre was captured in Argentina in October 2012. In recent years, Ecuador has lived up to its billing as the ""United Nations of Organized Crime."" As highlighted by El Comercio, the country has not only attracted the main players in the regional drug trade -- Colombian suppliers and Mexican buyers -- but also organized crime rings from around the world, including Nigeria, Russia, and China. There are numerous reasons for the growth in Ecuador's popularity with drug trafficking organizations, but the main reason has been the ease with which Colombian groups involved in drug production and transit, principally the FARC guerrillas and the Rastrojos, have been able to operate freely on both sides of the border. Lax and under resourced security, especially in ports and along the coasts, then make it an ideal dispatch point for the Colombians' cocaine, bringing in the Mexican cartels -- particularly the Sinaloa Cartel, which is known to have established a firm presence in the country -- and wholesale buyers from the world's other principal markets and trafficking hubs. However, these transnational groups have so far maintained a low profile, and their spread has not been accompanied by a dramatic spike in violence. These latest reports raise the possibility that this could change if the Urabenos -- the most aggressive and militaristic of Colombia's narco-paramilitary groups -- try to seize control of this critical criminal hub by force.

"Colombias BACRIM: On the Road to Extinction?A report written by Daniel Rico for the Woodrow Wilson Center insists that the current generation of Colombia's organized crime syndicates, the BACRIM, is doomed to extinction -- an encouraging, if controversial, assertion. In his thought-provoking study, ""The International Dimensions of Organized Crime in Colombia: the BACRIM, their Roots and Refuges"" ( PDF ) -- published as part of a series of Wilson Center papers on the spread of organized crime in the Americas and into parts of Africa -- Rico identifies some of the inherent weaknesses in Colombia's hybrid criminal organizations, known as ""Bandas Criminales"" (""Criminal Bands"") or BACRIM. Rico also compares the BACRIM to their powerful predecessors in the Medellin Cartel and the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). He explores the migration of the BACRIM and their leadership to Colombia's border regions and into neighboring countries, and their increasingly diverse criminal portfolios. The BACRIM were born during and after the mid-2000s demobilization of the AUC -- a political-military outfit that ostensibly formed to fight leftist rebels during the 1990s -- although one of these groups, the Rastrojos, has its roots in drug trafficking organization the Norte del Valle Cartel. The BACRIM's expansion, pioneered by the Rastrojos, was very fast. The demise of the Rastrojos, after the surrender of their boss Javier Calle Serna, alias ""Comba,"" to US authorities in May 2012, was equally swift, with a raft of arrests and loss of territory to the rival Urabenos. As Rico correctly states, the BACRIM are in a far weaker position than their drug cartel predecessors in the cocaine trade, as they have essentially become wholesale suppliers to Mexico's strongest criminal groups. Whereas in the days of the Cali and Norte del Valle Cartels, in the early 1990s, a kilo of cocaine generated some $16,000 profit (and this may be an underestimate), that same kilo, sold to the Mexicans today, generates only around $5,000 in profit. In the new narco-world, the Mexicans pocket a far greater share of the profits. The second weakness of the BACRIM, which is not addressed in Rico's report, is their reliance on rebel groups for coca base, the raw material for cocaine. Whereas previous generations of drug trafficking syndicates controlled coca crops, or had guaranteed access to them, today the BACRIM are largely dependent on the rebels for their coca base, the gooey paste that is the first stage of the cocaine production process. Unlike the AUC, the BACRIM do not have the military muscle to take on the largest of these rebel groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), or even the second largest, the National Liberation Army (ELN), in their strongholds, forcing BACRIM and guerrillas into an uneasy and fragile coexistence. Should the rebels ever decide to stop selling coca base to the BACRIM, the criminal dynamics in the country would change radically. However, the FARC are currently in peace talks with the government in Havana, Cuba. And as these talks progress towards a settlement, it is more likely that elements of the rebels will criminalize and work with the BACRIM. Organized crime follows the path of least resistance, and, as Rico details, the Colombian state now presents a serious amount of resistance to drug traffickers. The country now boasts one of the most efficient and capable security forces in the region. While it might be a stretch to state, as Rico does, that ""the totality (100 percent) of the leaders that began the BACRIM have been neutralized,"" the Colombian security forces do have a remarkable record of identifying and capturing (or killing) BACRIM leaders both inside and outside of the country. This brings us to the international dimension of the BACRIM. Rico correctly identifies the fact that the BACRIM have a permanent presence in Venezuela and Ecuador. He points to the concentration of drug crops along both borders, though these are, for the most part, controlled by the rebels, who at the moment sell a percentage of their coca on to the BACRIM. Venezuela has been the site for the capture of a veritable ""Who's Who"" of BACRIM leaders, foremost among them the Oficina de Envigado's Maximiliano Bonilla Orozco, alias ""Valenciano,"" in November 2011 , and, more recently, Daniel ""El Loco"" Barrera, in September 2012. Ecuador has also been a favorite for Colombian criminals. Several senior BACRIM commanders have been captured there (among them Rastrojos leader Juan Carlos Calle Serna ) and the fact that the country has the US dollar as its national currency makes it a natural draw for BACRIM leaders seeking to launder their profits. However, Colombian influence in Ecuador is being challenged as Mexican cartels send representatives down to secure cocaine shipments directly, often from the FARC, seeking to cut out the Colombian middlemen and further maximize profits. Rico also highlights the presence of Hector Buitrago, alias ""Martin Llanos"" (a former AUC commander) in Bolivia. The capture in Martin Llanos' cousin in Santa Cruz in June 2011 is evidence of Colombian drug trafficking links to Bolivia, and this Bolivian city has certainly become a regional center for organized crime, with heavy Colombian involvement. However, the assertion that the AUC warlord sent 1,200 men to Bolivia is unlikely. When InSight Crime interviewed Buitrago in 2002, at the height of his power, his entire organization barely reached 1,200 members. Moving further afield, Rico speaks of Spain, which has long been the principle entry point to Europe for Colombian cocaine. There, crime syndicates take advantage of the common language and large Colombian expatriate communities to facilitate business. Rico correctly identifies that Europe is now a far more attractive option for the BACRIM. They can earn three times more for a kilo of cocaine than when dealing with the Mexicans. The European market not only offers much better returns than the United States, but far less chance of interdiction, and minimal risk of extradition and incarceration. Rico also mentions that Southern Cone nations have become far less risky transit points for cocaine heading to Europe. These nations present an increasingly lucrative domestic market for cocaine and its derivatives. Shipments to Europe can experience a delay of weeks, if not months, in payment, whereas selling to local distribution networks in Brazil and Argentina gives an almost immediate return. Rico also highlights the importance of West Africa, focusing on Guinea-Bissau. This is a key route for cocaine moving to Europe. His assertion that Colombian criminals had a hand in the March 2009 murder of Guinea-Bissau's president, Joao Bernardo Vieira, is intriguing, but unsubstantiated. The murder was allegedly carried out by elements of the military, in revenge for the killing of the army chief of staff, Batista Tagme Na Waie, in a bomb blast the day before, which was blamed on Vieira. Rico rightly emphasizes that the export of drugs has become just one element in the BACRIM criminal portfolio. He identifies the smuggling of gasoline and other goods in and out of Venezuela as a significant stream of income, although the top BACRIM earners after cocaine are extortion, gold mining and domestic distribution of drugs. Indeed, for many BACRIM these earnings now outstrip those from the export of cocaine. Rico ties up his important paper by concluding that the BACRIM are facing extinction. He writes that only ""the Urabenos still maintain the characteristics that the BACRIM had at their beginnings, which does not mean that we are facing the end of criminality in Colombia, rather that what we are seeing is essentially a structural change in organized crime."" However, the BACRIM are very young, less than a decade old. Their evolution during this period has been dizzying, from more than 30 groups to one principal franchise today, that of the Urabenos. The story of the BACRIM is not yet over, and their evolution into a criminal franchise as strong as any in the region -- which is where InSight Crime believes the Urabenos are heading -- is still not finished. Colombia has historically been the pioneer in cocaine trafficking, and what has happened there is being repeated in Mexico, which currently dominates the international distribution of the drug: fragmentation of the major organizations into franchises, with independent groups working together as opportunities arise; groups becoming not only transnational in their business but in their centers of operations; and the development of wide portfolios of different criminal activities, not restricted to drug smuggling. Rather than being doomed to extinction, it may be that Colombia's BACRIM will usher in a new chapter and model of organized crime in the Americas."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Cocaine Rice Sparks Argentina Probe into Colombia Narcos. Argentina's authorities believe a criminal network from Colombia was behind a major drug export operation, indicative of the prominent role that Colombians continue to play in the region's transnational drug trade. In a series of raids conducted between September 17-19, Argentine custom officials found over 1,000 bags of rice infused with some 20 kilograms of cocaine on a ship bound to the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau. They went on to arrest nine Colombians and three Argentines in what has come to be known as the ""Narco Rice"" case, reported La Nacion. The cocaine-infused rice was reportedly a trial run for the drug trafficking group, who planned to use this technique to smuggle larger drug shipments to Europe. The group is reportedly headed by Colombian nationals Williams Triana Pena and his brother Erman, who allegedly established themselves in Argentina in 2012. They have been linked to various Colombian cartels, most recently the Urabenos. The Colombian drug ring relied on a wide-ranging network of collaborators in Argentina, including an oncologist who developed the technique for fusing cocaine onto rice. Other alleged members included an ex-Colombian police officer and the former deputy secretary at Argentina's Interior Ministry, who was reportedly instrumental in settiung up several front companies used to launder dirty money. The criminal group's activities first came to the attention of the authorities in 2011, following several drug seizures, reported Infobae. In 2012, members of the criminal network made contact with an Eastern European criminal group, a separate La Nacion report said, citing the United Kingdom's Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA). The Eastern European group was reportedly looking to open a new drug route from Argentina to Europe. The Triana Pena brothers and many other suspected leaders of the operation remain at large. La Nacion's profile on suspects in the Narco Rice case This case is illustrative of several wider dynamics in Argentina's transnational drug trade. The first is the ongoing importance of Colombian-run criminal organizations based in Argentina. Top-level Colombian drug traffickers and their associates have previously used the country as a hide-out and as a place to do business. While there are also multiple examples of sophisticated drug trafficking organizations being run primarily by Argentines , the Narco Rice case is evidence that Colombian nationals continue to play a major role in running transnational drug trafficking operations in Argentina. Additionally, the group's reported use of an ex-Interior Ministry employee to lauder funds is indicative of how the drug trade is capable of corrupting officials at all levels in Argentina. This recently prompted the former head of the Buenos Aires police force to compare Argentina's current state of affairs to the Colombia of Pablo Escobar. It is also unsurprising that this criminal network made contact with a mafia group based in Eastern Europe. The European market has become increasingly important for Latin America's drug trafficking networks, and members of the Italian mafia in particular have been known to use Argentina as a refuge ."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Report Highlights Disproportionate Costs of Crime in LatAm. A report by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) on the costs of crime and violence in Latin America and the Caribbean shows that while the region has recently made progress in some economic and social development indicators, the costs of the alarming security conditions in some countries are still disproportionately high. In its report, ""The Costs of Crime and Violence"" ( pdf ), the IDB estimates that the annual costs of crime and violence for countries in Latin America and the Caribbean amount to an average of 3.5 percent of gross domestic product, a figure which is almost two times higher than the one observed in highly-developed countries like Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Over the past few years, most of the region's countries have experienced some positive results with respect to their economic and social indicators, with average growth rates above 4 percent, stable inflation rates (with the exception of Venezuela and Argentina), decreasing poverty levels -- which in some parts of the region managed to meet the Millennium Development Goals -- and better educated and healthier populations. Yet when one looks at other indicators, such as citizen and national security as well as the criminal dynamics affecting the region, the outlook is not as bright. The nations of Latin America and the Caribbean are home to less than 9 percent of the world's population. However, nearly a third of the world's homicides occur within the region, 90 percent of which remain unpunished, while 60 percent of thefts involve violence. Furthermore, the region's growing prison population and widespread corruption among security forces and other institutions have created a number of obstacles to the region's development, highlighting the need for governments to step in to increase their presence in areas under the control of criminal groups. The average cost of crime and violence between 2010 and 2014 for the 17 countries studied by the IDB report amounted to an estimated $261 billion, an amount comparable to the money those countries spent on infrastructure during that period. The direct costs taken into account by the report are those that victims pay as a result of criminal activities, such as damages or losses, and those related to their prevention. The latter category includes public and private investment to prevent these illegal activities as well as the costs of responding to crime, such as the money spent on the judicial system and prisons. However, the report does not take into account the indirect costs of crime, which are best conceived of as the negative externalities that it generates, such as changes in consumption preferences, changes in people's behavior due to the fear of crime and increases in salaries for high-risk jobs, among others. High homicide rates are one of the key contributing factors to the high social costs of crime. Their impact is calculated taking into account the income that both the victim and the aggressor cease to receive, should the latter be sent to prison. A little more than 90 percent of homicide victims across the region were men, and nearly half of them were between 15 and 30 years old -- the most economically productive segment of the population. This in turn means that nearly 10 percent of homicide victims were women, an average of 4.3 per 100,000 people -- almost twice as high as the world average. During the years taken into account by the report, the average cost of homicides across the region oscillated between $9.8 and $11.4 billion per year. Among the 17 countries studied, the largest share of social costs related to homicides were observed in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. By contrast, Chile, Peru and Argentina registered the lowest costs related to homicides as a percentage of GDP. However, there appear to be some key differences across the region. In 2014, the costs of violence and crime amounted to 3 percent of Guatemala's GDP, 6.1 percent of El Salvador's and 6.5 percent of Honduras' (See the IDB?s breakdown of crime-related costs by country below). A more detailed geographical breakdown of the data for these three countries shows that, while in some parts of El Salvador homicides reportedly did not occur for some years, in others the rate was as high as 200 per 100,000 people, while the average for the departments with the highest homicide rates was 94.6, almost three times higher than the regional average and 14 times higher than the world average. A similar dynamic could be seen in Brazil, where in some states the costs of crime amounted to 2 percent of GDP, while in others the figure was almost three times higher. The difference can also be observed in the distribution of these costs. While in some states the losses were higher due to the social costs caused by homicides, in others the costs of private or public investments related to crime were far greater. In 2014, the region's crime-related public spending amounted to an average of $7.8 billion (or 0.2 percent of GDP), almost twice as much as what was spent in 2010. This figure is also close to the loss that the region's economies experienced as a result of the lack of productive activity on the part of their imprisoned populations. Local differences in violence levels also contrast with the global challenges posed by the ever-increasing threat of cyber crime, which crosses both physical and virtual borders. According to a study quoted by the IDB report, between 2010 and 2013 the demand for technologies to protect against cyber crimes grew 14.7 percent among companies and 10.7 percent among individuals. The activities of organized crime also transcend borders, since the region's drug cartels, criminal groups and gangs are able to migrate from one area to another and constantly restructure themselves. Today's organized crime groups are not the monolithic structures they were a few years ago. In some cases, they are divided into increasingly more sophisticated local groups that enjoy more autonomy. This in turn could allow criminal groups to increase their presence in some areas as opposed to others, and concentrate, as is often the case, in border regions. However, according to the IDB report, the relationship between the presence of organized crime groups and high homicide rates is not necessarily a direct one. This could be at least in part related to the different nature of criminal groups and the high levels of social control they hold in the communities where they operate. In countries such as El Salvador, home to some of the region's most violent gangs, these groups have shown on several occasions that they are capable of influencing homicide rates, and in some cases they have used this as a method for gaining political power. The decrease in the levels of security indicators across the region, despite the significant increase in the amount of resources spent to fight and prevent crime, is a clear sign that these resources are not being invested efficiently. While most of the homicides committed across the region remain unpunished -- at times as a result of weak institutions and widespread corruption -- the use of prisons as a means to fight these crimes and others is becoming increasingly popular. This strategy is premised upon the idea that increasing prison terms will deter criminal activities, but it seems to overlook the high costs that this approach implies for public spending. It also fails to take into account the economic impact for the families of the inmates, who -- as the report highlights -- are often working-age men from poor backgrounds. As InSight Crime has highlighted , the gradual implementation of these heavy-handed policies that began during the 1990s has created more problems than it helped to solve. High overpopulation rates and corruption ended up turning the region's prisons into breeding grounds for organized crime groups. Whether because of malpractice, corruption or lack of information needed to design efficient public policies, the current approach also does not include the rehabilitation and reintegration programs that should be implemented inside prisons. At the same time, it does not help to prevent, and in fact increases, the chances that the inmates' families could fall into the same spiral of poverty and violence that has fed the region's prisons for so long. The fact that the percentage of crime-related public spending in Latin America is twice as high as it is in developed countries also illustrates just how much of a burden financing security programs can put on state resources in the region. Despite the large share of resources directed toward security programs, these expenditures seem to provide poor results, suggesting they could be assigned more efficiently to programs in sectors like health and education, which tend to produce better returns on investment. Gathering accurate data on the economic and social impacts of crime and insecurity poses a number of challenges. The illegal and secretive nature of criminal activities presents a key obstacle whenever one tries to assess their impact, especially considering the growing sophistication of illegal groups and their ability to adapt and elude the authorities' constant efforts to dismantle them. Nevertheless, a thorough collection of information is crucial for scholars and policymakers to be able to contrast data between countries and draw clearer conclusions about the relationship between crime and socioeconomic outcomes. Yet certain methodologies for measuring the impacts of crime can leave important aspects of this relationship unexamined. The IDB report, for example, does not fully take into account the fear victims have when reporting crimes to the authorities, the victims' inability to present the information needed and at times the governments' own lack of willingness to publish data and other relevant information. For this reason, the estimates presented in the IDB report must be considered conservative at best. While the report does not measure the cost of corruption, in part due to the difficulty of assessing and comparing such costs, the damage that this widespread practice causes cannot be underestimated. In countries such as Guatemala, whose former president had to resign after the international community helped to uncover his role in a large-scale corruption scheme, graft is believed to be the cause of annual losses that amount to up to 3.5 percent of the country's GDP. Corruption generates massive losses of public funds, as well as distortions in all sorts of institutional and social spheres. Furthermore, due to its ubiquity in Latin American and Caribbean countries, criminal groups often use corruption as a way to co-opt state actors. Due to their high social, economic and political costs, eradicating crime and violence does not merely depend on how much money is invested to tackle these issues. If resources are only allocated to compensate and prevent the effects of crime in the short term, the region will never efficiently tackle and resolve its structural causes."	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
"Can Latin American Governments Keep Up With Cyber Criminals?Extensive reports have repeatedly underlined Latin America's vulnerability to cybercrime, an Achilles' heel which organized crime is already capitalizing on and that could develop into a serious security threat in the absence of robust countermeasures. According to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), cybercrime cost Latin America $90 billion last year , out of a worldwide $575 billion. The cyber security company Norton previously evaluated the cost of cybercrime in 2012 at $8 billion for Brazil, $3 billion for Mexico and $464 million for Colombia. Among the tools at criminals' disposal are malware computer programs whose uses have expanded throughout the region. Citing a study by an online security company, the American Society's Council of the Americas (AS/COA) reported that 50 percent of Latin American companies suffered malware attacks in 2013. Graphics c/o American Society's Council of the Americas (AS/COA). See original here. Not only has malware use been on the rise, the region's first corporate espionage virus was detected in Peru in 2012, a program whose main purpose was to steal data such as industrial plans and designs. A 2013 report by Trend Micro Inc. that was sponsored by the Organization of American States revealed a growing trend of malwares being designed in Latin American countries. Illegal botnets, which enable users to take remote-control of a computer without the owner's consent, are one of the favorite tools among criminal hackers in the region. They accounted for nearly 50 percent of the cybercrime attacks in Latin America in 2013, according to the AS/COA, with 120,000 computers infected by just two of these botnets. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has also reported a high proportion of command and control servers, which are used to manage illegal botnets, compared to the overall number of internet users in the Caribbean and Central America. In addition, several techniques are widely used by Latin American criminals to trick their victims into communicating confidential information. Phishing is an example, whereby the victims respond to a seemingly legitimate email and give up their personal or bank information. An estimated $26 million a year are stolen from bank clients through phishing, according to AS/COA. Spear phishing follows the same process but specifically targets organizations to gain access to their confidential data, and represents annual economic losses of $24 million. A third popular scam is ""pharming,"" in which cybercriminals redirect internet users from legitimate websites to malicious pages. The financial losses from pharming amount to $93 million a year in Mexico alone. Due to growing public awareness of these scam techniques and increased caution on the part of potential victims, criminals have adapted their methods to target social media users and smartphone owners. A 2013 study by the technology company Symantec saw an increase in fake offers on social media groups, fake ""like"" buttons dubbed ""likejacking,"" false smartphone applications and malevolent plug-ins. Through ""manual sharing scams,"" social media users may actually be both a victim and unknowingly help the criminals by sharing the malignant video or fake message with their social media friends. The Symantec report notes that ""users continue to fall prey to scams on social media sites, often lured by a fake sense of security conveyed by the presence of so many friends online."" Criminals have also increasingly resorted to malware attacks against banks to compensate for victims' growing caution with regards to their personal information and the banks' efforts to implement phishing countermeasures. Criminals now attempt to steal the victims' information by compromising their computer with a virus. They also directly attack banking systems before sending someone to collect the money from a counter, according to the Mexican cybersecurity company Mattica. The 2013 Symantec study also explains that cash distributors have been targeted by ""ATM Skimming,"" a method which allows criminals to obtain the data of a withdrawal card used at the machine. More worryingly perhaps, the company discovered a malware in Mexico which had the potential to corrupt ATMs, forcing them to dispense cash upon activation by the criminal. The finance and banking industry is among cybercriminals' favored targets and has increasingly come under attack through techniques that differ from the usual aforementioned scams. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the US Treasury Department observed increased occurrences in which criminals impersonate legitimate financial actors in order to conduct wire transfers after having compromised the victims' email account. The magnitude of the fraud is significant; Treasury notes ""that since 2013, there have been approximately 22,000 reported cases involving $3.1 billion."" Beyond the vast profits these scams and malwares generate, internet and communications technology (ICT) has increasingly become an integrated tool for drugs, arms and human trafficking groups' activities. Apart from using ICT for logistical purposes, it has become vital for criminal organizations looking to gain control of the profits earned from their illicit activities, which is becoming increasingly difficult as the financial sector increases its scrutiny of illicit cash flows. The Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists recently revealed that transnational organized crime (TOC) groups are increasingly exploiting corporate credit cards for business-to-business payments of ""phantom shipments"" between the United States and Mexico. Using the credit card of a front company in the US, criminals buy overvalued or non-existent products from Mexico. The drug money earned in the US is then laundered by entering the legal market in Mexico. The issue of cybercrime in Latin America is magnified by the states' vulnerability in that domain, which led the IDB to issue ""a call for action to start taking the necessary steps to protect this 21st century key infrastructure"" in a March 2016 report. Citing this study, Info Week reported that 80 percent of Latin American countries are without a national cybersecurity strategy to protect key infrastructure, 50 percent lack a coordinate response mechanism and only one-third possess a command and control center to tackle cybersecurity threats. Another vulnerability is the slow legal response on the part of many countries to cybercrime, which the IDB report assesses. While certain countries such as Colombia and the Dominican Republic have managed to develop relatively strong legal frameworks, the study points out widespread weaknesses in the indictment procedures for such crimes. Although estimates vary, the sheer amount of money lost to cybercrime in Latin America every year is so high that there is considerable urgency for countries to step up their efforts, both legal and technical. As AS/COA notes, most of the countries in the region have undertaken significant steps to strengthen their legislation and cybersecurity agencies, but the speed with which technology is developed or exploited in new, malicious ways requires constant vigilance and adaptation on behalf of both the authorities and private entities. Beyond the struggle against financial cyber theft, developing stronger cybersecurity measures could also deal a serious blow to TOC involved in various kinds of illicit trafficking. There is a general trend of increased scrutiny of the financial sector aimed at detecting illicit or suspicious transactions in Latin America and the United States. The Panama Papers is an emblematic example of how this scrutiny can tell us more about aspects of TOC's money laundering operations, and how cybersecurity could eventually allow for better policies and strategies to target a key component of criminal structures, namely their finances. SEE ALSO : Coverage of Money Laundering But perhaps the most urgent action that needs to be taken is the protection of vital infrastructure, as called for by the 2016 IDB report. Just as certain criminal groups have gained military capacity over the years, both in terms of training and equipment, it is not far-fetched to imagine TOC groups gaining the ICT that they need to rival government security institutions. Last year, Mexican cartels were able to interfere with the GPS of US border patrol drones, successfully sending the unmanned machines away from their designated monitoring area. Given the speed with which these technologies evolve, that will unlikely be the last -- or the most damaging -- example of how TOC uses cybercrime to facilitate its assorted criminal activities."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Peru Busts Fake Money Crime Ring. Authorities arrested three Peruvians and an Italian they say were involved in fabricating fake dollars and planning to export them to the United States, shining a light on Peru's lucrative counterfeit dollar trade. The arrests were made in two separate districts of capital city Lima, reported El Comercio. Police also seized about $836,000 in fake dollar bills, which the group was allegedly planning to smuggle in suitcases to New York. According to El Comercio, police said the group formed part of an international ring of counterfeit money producers. Peru 21 reported that the group may be linked to a drug trafficker operating in Peru's Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valleys, a region known as the VRAEM. An unnamed source in the police special investigative unit for counterfeit money told Peru 21 that this drug trafficker is known as ""Crazy Alfredo,"" and has been involved in the counterfeit money trade for at least two years. Alfredo was drawn to the illicit trade because it is ""cheaper"" than producing and smuggling cocaine, the source told Peru 21. Sending the shipment of fake dollar bills to the US would require an investment of about $30,000, which includes the $2,500 price of paying a smuggler and covering the smuggler's travel costs. Once the fake cash reached the US, Alfredo's criminal group could expect to make about $20,000 for every $100,000 worth of false bills -- in other words, a total profit of $130,000 for a shipment of $800,000 in fake dollars. In contrast, a kilo of cocaine sold in the US -- far riskier to produce and export -- would bring in an estimated profit of $25,000, the source told Peru 21. While the VRAEM is Peru's premier hub for cocaine production and smuggling, it would nevertheless be unsurprising if a drug trafficker based there decided to get involved in another type of illicit activity. Counterfeit money production in particular is a big business in Peru, with forgers producing fake dollars destined for Venezuela , Ecuador , and elsewhere. There has been little prior evidence to suggest that many VRAEM-based drug traffickers see counterfeit dollar production as more profitable than the drug trade. Until very recently, Peru was the world's top producer of coca , much of which is sourced from the remote jungle region. There may even be corrupt factions within Peru's military that are profiting handsomely off the VRAEM drug trade, as highlighted in a recent Associated Press report , with some officers allegedly charging $10,000 for every drug flight that takes off or lands in the area."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Chinese Smugglers Driving Up Jaguar Killings in Bolivia. The trafficking of jaguar teeth from Bolivia's natural parks to China has sparked worries that Asian smugglers are boosting this illegal trade. Between 2014 and 2016, 800 jaguar teeth have been seized by Bolivian authorities, suggesting that around 200 animals have been killed, reported the Bolivian Environment Forum (Foro Boliviano sobre Medio Ambiente - FOBOMADE). The teeth were reportedly intended to be smuggled to China. FOBOMADE reports that the current number of killed jaguars threatens to reach levels comparable to the 1980s, when hunting was still legal. This comes despite a 30-year campaign to stop the practice in protected forest areas. The majority of jaguar teeth seizures have been made in the neighboring Madidi and Pilon Lajas natural reserves, said Teresa Perez, director of the Environment Ministry's Biodiversity and Protected Areas Office. People working to protect the jaguars have reported that some Chinese nationals are responsible for the poaching. ""When tourism was growing and raising people's awareness regarding laws and preservation, there were very few cases"" of jaguar hunting, activist Daniel Manzaneda said. ""But since the Chinese came they've been killing them by the dozen, as well as ocelots, snakes and who knows what other species."" In May 2016, a Chinese citizen allegedly bought a radio announcement in Rurrenabaque municipality -- near Madidi -- in which he offered to buy jaguar teeth for $100 apiece. He was later arrested and six teeth were seized. Another Chinese citizen in Rurrenabaque was found with 300 jaguar teeth in 2014, although he is not currently behind bars. These nature reserves are vast and largely unprotected. While in 1997 there were 25 forest rangers in the Pilon Lajas and Madidi reserves, today there are only 12 covering the 40,000-hectare expanse, and they have to make do with poor salaries and a lack of resources. One of the detected wildlife trafficking routes from Madidi passes through the town of Ixiamas on its way to Peru. ""Past Ixiamas it's practically no man's land,"" a local police officer said. ""Brazilian mafiosos and Peruvians enter and traffic as they please. Now we're also seeing Chinese people, I don't know if they're competition or if they have agreements."" According to Perez, nine Chinese citizens and two Bolivians are currently being prosecuted for jaguar trafficking. In January, the Environment Ministry reported that 60 wildlife trafficking cases have been opened in the past 10 years. Jaguar trafficking in Bolivia could be evidence that Chinese organized crime is further spreading its tentacles into wildlife trafficking in Latin America. To be sure, Chinese demand for exotic food and other goods is a driving force behind what is now one of the world's largest criminal economies. Jaguar teeth are of great value in traditional Asian medicine. Various Latin American countries feed the Chinese black market, including Mexico, Peru and Ecuador with their offerings of prohibited seafood items. What's more, there are signs that the presence of Chinese mafias is growing in the region. Authorities in Bolivia and other South American countries have detected Chinese human trafficking networks. And as the economic and political ties between China and Latin America deepen, it's possible that the Chinese criminal groups in the region will strengthen ties to their homeland. It is difficult to understand the true reach of Chinese mafias in Latin America, however, as the modus operandi of these groups is notably low-key."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Inside Guatemalas Animal Trafficking Trade. ""The great green macaw is extinct in the wild. It only exists in captivity now,"" says Fernando Martinez, director of the ARCAS wildlife rescue center, as he walks amongst the cages of animals under his care. ""It's being killed by habitat destruction and illegal species trafficking."" Guatemala is considered one of the most biologically diverse countries in the Americas, alongside Mexico, Costa Rica, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Venezuela. It is home to 192 species of mammals, 486 types of birds and 27 species of amphibians. Nevertheless, this diversity is threatened by trafficking networks in east and north Guatemala, which are focused on extracting wildlife for commercialization in Mexico, the United States, Spain, Holland and Australia. This article originally appeared on Connectas and Soy502 , with support from the International Center for Journalists ( ICFJ ). It was translated, edited, and reprinted with permission. See Spanish original here. One of the targets of these trafficking networks is the Ara macao species, commonly known as the scarlet macaw. Only 250 of these birds are left in Guatemala, according to a census by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). There is much foreign demand for the scarlet macaw, which can fetch up to $3,000 on the black market. They're sold through agreements between distributors and buyers, or can be found easily on online retail pages or Facebook, said WCS experts. Possessing a scarlet macaw is prohibited in Guatemala under its Protected Areas Law, which states that macaws can only be bought or used for research for conservation purposes, under the terms laid out by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). But for animal poachers, known locally as ""guaqueros,"" this law doesn't exist. Guaqueros operate in multiple areas, and many are based in Guatemala's northern Peten department, including the border areas with Mexico and Belize. A scarlet macaw in Guatemala's ARCAS wildlife rescue center. The bird suffers from a condition that leads it to pluck out all its feathers, due to years spent in captivity. Photo by Alexis Batres for Soy502 Over the last decade, Guatemala's wildlife trafficking police (known as DIPRONA, by its Spanish initials) has worked with the Public Ministry and the National Council of Protected Areas (CONAP) to rescue 23 scarlet macaws. Many were found in homes and very few en route to foreign markets. According to the WCS, this troubling, as it means that few people are being arrested even as the trafficking of the birds continues. Guaqueros rob chicks from nests and raise them in hope of selling the birds to private collectors or other markets, WCS Geological Research director Rony Garcia explained. ""All of these macaws were being stolen in Pipiles [in Peten department], but this was stopped due to forest concessions and the protection of the Laguna del Tigre National Park,"" Garcia said. ""The presence of the army, DIPRONA and CONAP has helped, but the practice continues in other areas."" According to Garcia, macaw population recovery will be slow as macaws can only have one chick per year. WCS is currently monitoring 40 nests, but does not have enough time and resources to cover all of Peten. ""Chicks are stolen in areas where DIPRONA is not present,"" Garcia said. ""That's where the [trafficked] macaws are coming from. And where do they end up? How do they get there? Via the same routes you and I would use to go to the capital or to the border."" Species in Demand ""This is the way many communities have made a living they collect parrots to survive."" There is also a peculiar demand for reptiles. According to Carlos Mansilla, wildlife technical director at CONAP, lizard species Heloderma horridum charlesbogerti -- commonly known as the Guatemalan beaded lizard and the Montagua Valley beaded lizard, is a unique species native to Guatemala. It's found in eastern Zacapa department's dry forests. People around the Cabanas municipality, in Zacapa, collect these lizards and sells them for around 200 Quetzals (US$26). Traffickers then sell the lizard in Holland and Australia for up to $2,000, CONAP said. Other trafficked animals include iguanas, turtles, snakes, birds, and mammals like howler monkeys and spider monkeys. Ocelots, pumas and even jaguars have also been seized by authorities. ""Our exotic species are sold abroad illegally,"" Mansilla said. ""They go to private collections. As long as there is demand for our species there will be illegal sales of our animals."" How the Trafficking Networks Operate It all starts with someone in Peten looking to earn a few coins. They find a bird nest and steal the chicks, which don't even know how to fly yet. The chicks are then taken to a distribution center in in the village of Sajpuy, in the municipality of San Andres in Peten, according to an anonymous source. There the birds are handed over to individuals known locally as ""picoperos."" Picoperos drive pickup trucks equipped with animal cages. They are the intermediaries with distributors who sell the birds to local markets or foreign buyers. According to the source, picoperos directly negotiate with drug traffickers and use some of the same border crossings on which drugs and wood are shipped to Mexico. ""That is the primary destination for those animals,"" the source said. Spider and howler monkeys are agile and hard to catch, so collectors often shoot at mothers so they'll fall to the ground with their babies. CONAPS' Mansilla confirmed that picoperos are in direct contact with local communities. ""The picopero talks with them, asking for animals, paying the bare minimum and then leaving the country with wood, drugs and exotic plants which they also traffic,"" he said. ""This has been the way many communities in Cabanas [Zacapa department] and some near Sierra de las Minas [Jalapa department] have made a living,"" Mansilla added. ""They collect parrots to survive, but don't know they can go to prison for up to 10 years if they're caught trafficking these species."" Many of the methods for capturing animals are extremely cruel. Spider and howler monkeys are agile and hard to catch, so collectors often shoot at mothers so they'll fall to the ground with their babies. Many of the baby monkeys do not survive, Martinez of ARCAS explained. Transportation Methods There are diverse ways to transport animals, from boxes and cages with the animals in plain sight, to backpacks and vehicles with false bottoms. Some animals are drugged so they won't make noise and be discovered. In one instance, two small baby turtles were found inside a courier package during a customs check, performed by the Committee on Imports and Exports (CombexIm) in Aurora International Airport. A mother howler monkey with her baby in the ARCAS wildlife rescue center. Photo by Alexis Batres for Soy502 CONAP divides Guatemala into five regions, noting that 131 species have been seized in the central region, between the departments of Guatemala and Sacatepequez. In the east, there were 133 species seized; in the western region, 47, and in the northwest 24. ""We rescued capuchin monkeys, spider monkeys and howler monkeys, snakes, boas, macaws, parakeets and parrots. The birds are the preferred species in this business,"" Mansilla said. Local and International Routes CONAP hypothesizes that the great majority of animals stolen from their natural habitats leave Guatemala and end up in the private collections of buyers who have paid a commission. Their primary point of exit is the Guatemalan-Mexico border. CONAP officials have also have detected major movement on the border between Guatemala and Honduras in the east, and Guatemala's other border with Mexico in the west. ""We have a problem in the center with local markets,"" Mansilla said. ""But these areas have a lot of ongoing conflicts and require a lot of logistics in order to coordinate seizures."" In Mexico, according to statistics from the Federal Prosecutor for Environmental Protection (PROFEPA, by its Spanish initials), roughly 5,744 exotic species were rescued between 2013 and 2014. The recoveries included 694 operations throughout Mexico and resulted in 94 people arrested for biodiversity crimes. The head of the ARCAS wildlife rescue center says the great green macaw is nearly extinct in the wild in Guatemala, due to animal trafficking. Photo by Alexis Batres for Soy502 PROFEPA deputy prosecutor Alejandro del Mazo told Mexican newspaper Milenio that organized crime was involved in the illegal trafficking of species. Del Mazo also noted there is a trafficking route -- primarily used for moving wood out of Honduras -- which runs through Guatemala, then Mexico, and then onward to black markets in China. For its part, Honduras has reported there is an unquantifiable amount of trafficking in reptiles. There is also a large black market for sea turtles. Meanwhile, the Honduran Association of Animal and Environmental Protection (AHPRA by its Spanish initials) has denounced the trafficking of toucans, scarlet macaws, ocelots and spider monkeys. Back in Guatemala, trafficked species are primarily moved along the CA-1 highway, which connects to the Atlantic Ocean and runs between the departments of Alta and Baja Verapaz. There is only one checkpoint along this highway, in Modesto Mendez, considered the border between Peten and Izabal departments. And even there, Martinez complains that controls are insufficient. ""Looking at the past 20 years, between 1995 and 2015, seizures have been declining, but trafficking is not declining. This is because checkpoints are either non-existent or don't search sufficiently,"" Martinez said. Similarly, police wildlife trafficking division DIPRONA doesn't have enough personnel to cover the whole country, according to Public Ministry prosecutor Aura Marina Lopez. ""They are less than 400 of them. It doesn't cover it,"" she added. According to DIPRONA, there are 381 agents throughout Guatemala who specialize in preventing environmental crimes. They operate primarily in routes also suspected of being used for exotic wood trafficking. As part of their strategy, there are members of the police and of DIPRONA at each checkpoint, ranging from five to ten agents. Lopez also explained that there are a large number of cases and ongoing investigations against animal trafficking networks. ""We've identified various international networks found within the country. That's all I can say,"" she said. Map of trafficking routes through Guatemala El Guarda ""El Guarda"" is a market located in Zone 11 of Guatemala City. It's known for offering contraband products from Mexico, stolen cellphones, clothes, and of course animals, primarily birds. Here you can see small parakeets, caged parrots, macaws, and other exotic birds. Ocelots can occasionally be glimpsed, but less frequently, as they have typically already been purchased and are awaiting the arrival of their new owner. Those in the market know the regulations and do not give prices unless a species is purchased directly in cash. CONAP, the Public Ministry and associations like the Wildlife Conservation Society and wildlife conservation center ARCAS consider El Guarda one of the primary distribution centers for exotic animals. The Public Ministry's prosecutor has insisted that other contraband besides animals is sold here and large transactions conducted at the market are under investigation by authorities. ""It's very difficult to get in there,"" the prosecutor said. Combating Trafficking The majority of animals at ARCAS' rescue center were found in homes and have been domesticated, Martinez explained. ""We have a jaguar that was brought in three years ago. It was a pet."" Recently, the wildlife trafficking police and the Public Ministry alerted Martinez of a big operation. This led him to believe they had dismantled a criminal network focused on trafficking jaguars. Wood traffickers who find jaguars are known to hide them in their trucks and tranquilize them, to keep them from making noise as they are transported. Photo by Alexis Batres for Soy502 But no jaguars were involved. ""We decommissioned wood and an ocelot,"" Martinez said. ""It was brought to the rescue center. The animal has been highly domesticated and is now in quarantine."" The Prosecutor for Environmental Crimes said the wildlife trafficking police monitor different trafficking outes in the country, via checkpoints and mobile patrols. They detain suspicious vehicles and examine them. Through these methods alone they detained 708 people for environmental crimes in 2014, seized 320 cars used in trafficking, four boats, three vans, 57 firearms and 235 chainsaws. The last items belonged to wood traffickers operating in the Mayan Biosphere reserve in northern Guatemala, police said. To date, authorities have not been able to dismantle a single animal trafficking network and all current cases are for illegal possession of endangered species, Guatemala's Prosecutor for Environmental Crimes said. Authorities say they are doing their best to prevent species sold on the black market from leaving the country. Nevertheless, last April saw the dismantling of a massive customs fraud ring which allowed for the untaxed entry and exit of thousand of containers over four years. To date it is unknown what was transported with such liberty through Guatemalan customs.

Costa Rica Bans Shark Finning. Following years of pressure by environmental groups, Costa Rica has passed a comprehensive ban on shark finning, outlawing not only the practice itself, but also the importation and transportation of shark fins. The executive order, which was signed by President Laura Chinchilla on October 10, closes loopholes in the country's existing legislation, which was passed in 2001 and did not include restrictions on the shark fin trade, reports Reuters. The new law imposes strict penalties on those caught finning sharks, such as fines and the loss of fishing licenses. Pressure has mounted for years on the Costa Rican government to confront the problem, especially given the importance the country places on protecting its bountiful natural resources. According to La Nacion , up to 400,000 sharks were caught in 2011 off the coast of Costa Rica for the purpose of selling the fins, and since 2010 over 15 tons of shark fins have entered the country from Nicaragua. Shark finning -- in which a shark's fin is removed, often while the animal is still alive, and the rest of the body tossed back in the ocean -- is widespread along the coasts of Central America. Due to high demand in East Asia for shark fins to use in soup and in traditional medicine, shark fins now constitute a multi-million dollar industry. According to the Pew Environmental Group , shark fins can fetch up to $300 on the black market. Globally, over 70 million sharks are killed each year due to the fin trade. Honduras has also taken steps to combat the illicit shark fin trade. In 2011, President Porfirio Lobo made Honduran waters a permanent shark sanctuary , outlawing all commercial shark fishing. In July of this year, the president burnt over 100 shark fins seized from illegal fishermen to demonstrate the government's commitment to protecting the country's many shark species.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Guatemala Moves to Deter Eco-Trafficking. Guatemalan authorities are set to enforce stricter airport security measures in hopes of better combating eco-trafficking, or the smuggling of endangered plants and animals to the U.S. and Europe. According to InfoSur Hoy , the Guatemalan security forces are preparing to tighten border controls, increase inter-agency coordination and set up a special security office at the international airport, in order to deter the smuggling of endangered species from the country. Trafficking of endangered species is a lucrative business in Guatemala and across Central America, and can sometimes be more lucrative than arms or human trafficking. Estimates by Interpol say the global trade generates up to $20 billion in profits a year. Exotic animals smuggled from the region often sold to pet stores, private zoos or laboratories for experimentation in the U.S. In Guatemala, logging, illegal fisheries and the theft of rare artefacts are all trades which support smugglers, who often prey on the poorest and most isolated areas. Posing as students or scientists, the smugglers reportedly offer $60 to $120 per species to poor residents in these areas. While the fee may be the equivalent to two months pay for the collector, the smuggler can sell the same species for as much as $5,000. According to the head of Guatemala's wildlife agency, shipments of endangered or protected species can net traffickers as much as $50,000. So far this year 20 suspects have been detained in Guatemala for attempted eco-trafficking. 	0	0	1	0	0	1	0
"Politicians, Businesses in Deforestation Free-For-All in Guaviare, Colombia. Recent investigations in Colombia have found that government leaders and landowners in Colombia's department of Guaviare have teamed up to illegally deforest the Amazon in quest of mutual profit. Last December, the former mayors of Calamar and Miraflores, Pedro Pablo Novoa and Jhonivar Cumbe, were arrested after it was revealed that during their time in office, they had encouraged illegal deforestation in Guaviare in order to build a 138-kilometer highway between their towns. The Attorney General's Office issued whopping fines to the two mayors and former Guaviare governor, Nebio Echeverry, who is also implicated in the deforestation, the magazine Semana revealed. Zona Franca recently exposed accelerated deforestation in Guaviare related to illicit crops, palm oil plantations and extensive ranching in territories like the savanna La Fuga. It also revealed Guaviare has the second-highest rate of deforestation in Colombia. ""What is happening is an illegal appropriation of the country's uncultivated lands by individuals that have a lot of capital and are able to cut down 100 or 200 hectares of forest (at a time),"" said Rodrigo Botero, an environmental expert that recently visited the zone. Despite 90 percent of the department being protected, the environmental institute Institute for Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (Instituto de Hidrologia, Meteorologia y Estudios Ambientales - IDEAM) reported a rise in deforestation of at least 23.071 hectares between 2015 and 2018 with no end in sight. Guaviare is exemplary of how local interests can share a slice of the pie when it comes to deforestations. Criminal groups, entrepreneurs and politicians, everyone appears to benefit from the logging which is slowly destroying the Amazon rainforest. Former governor Echeverry has been accused of being at the heart of a lot of it. According to documents from the Attorney General's Office quoted by Semana, the highway he supported had ""neither permits nor environmental licenses."" Additionally, the continuous passage of heavy vehicles and illegal logging have only further damaged the protected land and water resources in the area. As a result, the governor's office of Guaviare was fined over 1 billion pesos ($300,000). Echeverry was included on the Clinton List between 2010 and 2015 and is believed to be close to businessmen Jorge Gaitan, Ramon Rojas and Saul Aguirre, who all benefited from lucrative contracts , according to official records from Echeverry's time in office. In a document from the Attorney General's Office presented by Zona Franca, these individuals were able to appropriate huge tracts of land for their agro-industrial projects, in exchange for endorsing the former governor. According to the document, large areas of land were appropriated to these individuals for high-impact agro-industrial projects that required deforesting the natural forest, in exchange for their endorsement of the former governor. And government leaders are not the only ones guilty of profiting from deforestation. While the FARC used to have codes of conduct regarding deforestation, illegal logging and mining have soared since their 2016 demobilization. And their successors, the ex-FARC Mafia, are all too happy to participate in deforestation, encouraging local farmers to do so, and extorting fees from large landowners, according to non-governmental organization Amazonia Socio Ambiental. The ex-FARC 7th Front and 40th Front were named as particular culprits."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Sinaloa Cartel Laundered Drug Money by Melting Gold: Report. A recent report describes how the Sinaloa Cartel used gold sales to move drug trafficking profits from the US back to Mexico, shedding light on a practice that has become heavily favored by some criminal groups in Latin America. Court documents viewed by Bloomberg detail how Sinaloa Cartel operatives based in Chicago would use profits from drug sales to buy gold bars and jewelry in the area. The gold was then shipped via FedEx to a company in Florida, which melted down the gold and sold it for cash. The Florida company would then keep 1 percent of the profits and send the rest of the money to a business in Mexico, Bloomberg reported. Operatives involved in the scheme would also falsify paperwork, making it look as though the Mexican business had legitimately sold the gold to their partners in Florida. Members of the Sinaloa Cartel sent hundreds of boxes full of gold to the Florida company before US authorities raided the company's office outside of Miami in January 2014, Bloomberg reported. Sources consulted by Bloomberg said that authorities found evidence of the Florida company laundering funds for other drug trafficking rings as well. The Sinaloa Cartel operatives in Chicago were charged with money laundering in 2015. According to a Department of Justice press release , they also used companies in California as part of the cash-to-gold scheme. As the Chicago case illustrates, there are multiple reasons why criminal groups have begun using gold as a means to launder illicit profits. The origins of melted gold are difficult to trace, and US companies that deal with gold face less scrutiny than institutions that handle cash transfers, according to Bloomberg. Criminal groups may have opted for cash-for-gold money laundering schemes after Mexico limited monthly dollar deposits in cash for Mexican businesses in 2010 (although Mexico partly reversed this measure in 2014). This move was meant to discourage criminal groups from making large transactions of drug dollars to Mexican banks, but instead it may have pushed the cartels into using other money laundering techniques, including setting up US-based front companies. Using gold as a means to disguise dirty money has long been practiced by Colombian criminal groups. The ongoing popularity of this method may be one reason why illicit gold mining continues to thrive in places like Peru, according to a recent report on organized crime and gold mining by research group the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Venezuela Military Profit From Illegal Gold Mining: Ex-Governor. A Venezuela party leader has blamed corruption in the armed forces for the disappearance of 28 miners, hinting at long-standing military involvement in the illegal gold industry. Former Bolivar state governor Andres Velasquez has accused the military of benefiting from illegal gold mining, in the wake of the disappearance and possible murder of 28 miners in south Venezuela. In an interview with Union Radio , Velasquez -- one of the leaders of opposition party Radical Cause (La Causa Radical - LCR) -- blamed collusion between criminal groups and corrupt officials for the miners' disappearance. ""There are criminal gangs present,"" Velasquez said. ""All of their leaders have been identified -- 'El Juancho,' 'El Topo,' 'El Gordo,' 'El Chingo' [They are] all-powerful mining 'chiefs.'"" He also asserted that military officials present in the area charge illegal miners extortion fees in exchange for allowing them to operate. Bolivar state congressman Americo De Grazia -- also of the LCR -- recently made similar assertions , claiming that while members of the armed forces condemn illegal mining, officials profit by collecting extortion fees in exchange for allowing miners to operate. Allegations that the armed forces are deeply involved in Venezuela's illegal mining industry have been around for quite some time. Thus, in some ways the rumours that authorities participated in the recent disappearance of over two dozen miners in Bolivar are unsurprising. One recent report that alleged Venezuela's security officials are involved in illicit mining was a 2015 documentary by Discovery MAX (see video below). The film asserted that Venezuela's armed forces benefit from a lack of state control in illegal mining hotspot Bolivar, as reported by Efecto Cocuyo. According to local government sources, high-ranking military officials support and give weapons to criminal ""syndicates"" that offer local miners protection in return for a slice of their profits. Military officials reportedly attack and rob those that refuse to pay these fees, and resell confiscated gold to third parties, according to Efecto Cocuyo. It remains to be seen whether a Congress controlled by a non-Chavista majority will push harder to investigate such reports of corruption within the security forces. In one notable turn of events, Congress has already openly debated whether the former President of Congress, Diosdado Cabello, has links to the transnational drug trade. This stands in contrast to the status quo under President Hugo Chavez and President Nicolas Maduro, when such allegations were rarely investigated diligently."	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
"Colombias FARC Profit from Illegal Gold Mining in Peru. A journalist in Peru has reported that Colombia's FARC guerrillas are profiting from the illegal gold trade inside Peru, underscoring the rebels' cross-border activities and their deep involvement in the lucrative illegal mining business. According to reports by Cecilia Valenzuela in El Comercio and in television program Mira Quien Habla (see video), an alliance has existed between the 63rd Front of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Peruvian illegal miners operating along the Putumayo River -- which divides Colombia and Peru -- for at least three years. Octavio Ortiz Ramirez, alias ""Wilmer El Burro,"" the head of the 63rd Front of the FARC's Southern Bloc, charges the Peruvian miners for protection services and logistical support, she reported. Colombian police have identified the Colombian national Jair Manrique Pedroza as the top buyer of illegal gold from this region, according to Valenzuela. El Tiempo reported that Colombian police have also identified the people who serve as go-betweens for the FARC leaders, gold miners and buyers. Some 3,000 grams of gold are reportedly extracted in this border region each month, with each gram worth around $30, making a total of $90,000. This alleged movement of the FARC into Peru's gold trade in part speaks to the profits to be gleaned from the business. Illegal gold mining in Peru is worth an estimated $ 3 billion a year -- more than double the estimated value of the drug trade. The FARC already have significant experience in this illicit industry in their home country, taxing mining operations and even exerting control over the extraction process in mineral-rich provinces like Antioquia and Choco. A similar phenomenon has been reported in Venezuela's gold trade. Sources in Venezuela told InSight Crime they had seen direct FARC involvement in gold mining in the southern Venezuelan province of Amazonas, with the guerrillas offering protection and controlling extraction. The rebels have become increasingly concentrated in Colombia's border regions due to pressure from Colombia's military in the center of the country, as noted in a report by the Fundacion Ideas para la Paz (FIP). The area inside the Venezuelan border is already an important safe haven and operational base for the group, and there have been previous reports of a FARC presence in Peru as well. In 2008, Caretas magazine accessed official documents that indicated some 1,500 hectares of Peruvian coca were controlled by the FARC, and that members of the guerrilla group had been detected in Peru as far back as 1989."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Urabenos Plan to Expand into Emerald Region: Police. Colombia's most powerful criminal syndicate, the Urabenos, is moving in on the lucrative emerald business, looking to take control of the gem trade and the money laundering potential of this under-regulated industry. The plan was discovered after Colombia's Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DIJIN) began probing the January assassination of Victor Ramirez , a lawyer who represented imprisoned emerald kingpin Pedro Nel Rincon, alias ""Pedro Orejas."" According to Semana , the assassin responsible -- who was captured soon after the crime -- began cooperating with authorities after his escaped accomplice was murdered weeks later, apparently to protect the people who ordered the crime. The investigation found that Oscar Murcia, the brother of emerald baron Luis Murcia Chaparro, alias ""Pequines,"" had ordered the hit and that the brothers had entered into a pact with the Urabenos in order to pursue their violent rivalry with Rincon. Murcia, who was arrested for his part in the crime in late March , was observed making numerous trips to the Urabenos stronghold of Uraba, in the northwest of Colombia, as well as holding regular meetings with key Urabenos operative Yoni Cano, alias ""Llanero,"" who was also captured at the end of March. The alliance has subsequently been linked to a November grenade attack against Rincon , which left his son dead. The Urabenos apparent bid to establish influence in Colombia's emerald producing region is not without precedent, with the Medellin Cartel famously launching an unsuccessful attempt to enter the zone in the 1980s, lured by the money laundering potential of the green gems. That bloody incursion prompted the so-called ""green wars,"" with private armies hired by the gem barons beating off the invaders and fighting among themselves, leaving thousands of dead. The winner of the green war, Victor Carranza, who became known as the ""Emerald Czar,"" kept the peace after that. However Carranza died in April 2013 , leaving behind a power vacuum which has sparked fears of a new green war. Rincon, who was Carranza's main rival and linked to several attempts on his life, has been, perhaps prematurely, labeled the ""New Emerald Czar,"" yet the attacks against him and his allies demonstrate he does not have the influence Carranza once enjoyed. With Rincon imprisoned and the Urabenos apparently setting their sights on the region, violence is likely to escalate further. "	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"With Eye on Illegal Mining, Colombia Creates Environmental Crime Office. Colombia created a prosecutor's office which will deal exclusively with environmental crime. One significant question is how much energy the new office will put into investigating unlicensed mining, a source of money for the FARC and BACRIMs. The unit will consist of 22 attorneys trained in environmental law, according to El Espectador. The office will reportedly prioritize investigations related to environmental contamination, invasive use of protected land, and unlicensed exploitation of resources. This may prove particularly significant for Colombia's population of traditional and artesanal miners, many of whom do not have the legal paperwork to prove their right to work certain mines. In mineral-rich departments like Antioquia and Cauca, unlicensed mines frequently must pay extortion taxes to armed groups like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ). In Antioquia, miners told InSight Crime that the typical fee is between one and three million pesos (about $526 to $1,500) for each excavator which enters the FARC's territory. In other parts of the country , armed gangs may tax the amount of gold actually produced per miner. Colombia is currently experiencing a mining ""boom."" Some 40 percent of its territory has seen concessions handed out to, or solicited by, multinationals in the mining or energy sector. The creation of an office dedicated to prosecuting environmental crime may be partly intended to show investors that Colombia is serious about enforcing environmental standards. The main development to look out for is how much time the prosecutorial office actually spends working on cases related to unlicensed mining. The Colombian government cracked down on the practice in 2011, citing security concerns because many unlicensed mines pay extortion taxes to the FARC. Mining activists have argued that the government is trying to edge out traditional mining to encourage the entry of multinational companies. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Are Asian Phone Pirates Looking to Access LatAm Through Paraguay?Paraguay has seized over 10,000 apparently fake cell phones in Ciudad del Este, suggesting Asian phone counterfeiters are attempting to access the Latin American market through one of the region's premier smuggling hubs. After investigators noticed counterfeit phones being sold in the eastern city, police from Paraguay's intellectual property unit raided a shopping area where they discovered 150 crates of phones, reported ABC. Although the phones had no external brand markings, when they were turned on the logo of communications giant Samsung appeared, leading investigators to conclude the phones were pirated. The shipment has been traced to an Asian man, who is currently out of the country, according to ABC. Over the last decade, the pirated cell phone business, led by Chinese counterfeiters, has boomed. The genesis of the industry was the introduction of a new product aimed at phone manufactures -- a cheap and basic make-your-own phone set selling for $15, which just requires a plastic case and new software to turn it into a new product line. China's notorious counterfeiters were quick to realize the potential of the phones and began flooding the black market with imitation handsets with pirated software, which sell for around a third of the price of genuine products produced by companies such as Apple and Nokia. After successfully claiming a large slice of the phone market in China, counterfeiters began to target foreign markets, in particular India, Russia, and countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa. Latin America would be a logical next step for phone counterfeiters. It is a region that has seen rapid growth in use of mobile technologies, has significant contraband networks, is tolerant of counterfeit goods, and has high poverty and inequality levels, making for high levels of price sensitivity. Ciudad del Este in Paraguay is also a sensible choice of places to bring these goods in. Located in the Tri-border region where Paraguay meets Argentina and Brazil, the city is renowned for lawlessness and corruption, which has helped turn into one of the region's main hotspots for contraband, smuggling and counterfeit goods.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Honduras Seizes 100,000 Gallons in Contraband Fuel. A ship carrying some 110,000 gallons of contraband fuel, allegedly originating in Venezuela , was intercepted by Honduran naval forces, raising the question of whether a smuggling operation is indeed moving contraband fuel between the two countries. As newspaper Proceso reports , the Honduran Navy intercepted the ship, named the ""Island Lady,"" on February 16 in the Caribbean Sea near Guanaja Island, about 40 miles off the Honduran coast. The ship was reportedly carrying diesel and gasoline, both of which are cheap and abundant in Venezuela. A Naval spokesperson said that the fuel was meant for an ""important"" person in Honduras, without providing further details. Nor did the security forces release the name of the owner of the ship. Authorities also said that the exact quantity of contraband fuel onboard the ship is not known at this time. The 14 Honduran crew members were detained and are facing a pending investigation. It would be unsurprising if the fuel did turn out to originate in Venezuela, which has some of the cheapest fuel in the world, averaging nine cents per gallon of premium gasoline. One question is whether the fuel was actually transported from Venezuela to Honduras, over 1,000 miles of ocean. In spite of this long distance, arguably smugglers would still have the economic incentive to make the trip, given the low prices of fuel in Venezuela and the profits that the contraband product would bring in Honduras. This would especially hold true as the Honduran government just announced a hike in fuel prices. Mexico is the traditional source of contraband fuel in Honduras. Last year, reports emerged stating that the Mexican Navy seized nearly 80,000 gallons of stolen diesel fuel belonging to the Zetas , destined for Honduras. Mexican criminal organizations are blamed for stealing thousands of gallons of gasoline per hour from state oil company Pemex, although it is unclear how much of this stolen fuel stays inside Mexico and how much is exported to other countries.

"More Mexicans Jailed for Cocaine Indicates Perus Role in Drug Trade. Peru has the second largest number of Mexican prisoners of any country after the United States, the vast majority of whom are held on drug charges, an indication of Peru's growing international role in the drug trade and its importance for Mexican drug cartels. According to figures from Mexico's Foreign Ministry (SRE), as of April 2014 there were 191 Mexican nationals imprisoned in Peru, 97 percent of whom either faced or had been convicted on cocaine trafficking charges, reported El Universal. Judging by their relatively brief sentences, many of the Mexicans detained in Peru likely served as so-called ""drug mules"" -- individuals who transport small quantities of drugs in their luggage, under their clothes, or ingested in capsules -- or as low-level cartel operatives. Seventy-five percent of those who had been sentenced received terms of between four and 15 years. The remaining 25 percent were sentenced to more than 15 years in prison, a length of time typically given to higher-level cartel operatives, who may have organized or financed drug shipments. The figures show a drastic increase in the number of Mexicans detained in Peru in recent years. Between 2001 and 2009, the Mexican Embassy recorded an average of 10 Mexicans detained annually in the country, according to La Republica , but between 2010 and April 2014 that figure rose to 37. According to the newspaper, close to half of the Mexican prisoners detained in Peru were between 18 and 35 years old. A survey conducted by Mexico's Embassy in Peru found that 85 percent of detained respondents said they had traveled to Peru because of unemployment, debts, or other economic difficulties. A small number reported making the trip because of threats or extortion. According to Foreign Ministry figures published in January 2014 , Panama and Colombia had the third and fourth highest numbers of Mexican prisoners after Peru. In Panama, close to 96 percent of the country's 94 Mexican prisoners had been detained on drug charges, while 92 percent were behind bars for the same reason in Colombia (see map). Japan, Costa Rica, and Spain also held significant numbers of Mexican prisoners. Although the number of Mexican prisoners detained in Peru pales in comparison to the number locked up in the United States -- which was at 35,734 in September -- Peru has nearly twice as many Mexican prisoners as the third and fourth countries on the list. The sharp increase in the number of Mexicans imprisoned in Peru in recent years and the fact that the vast majority are accused of drug trafficking indicate that foreign nationals are being drawn in as Peru takes on a growing role in the regional drug trade. Peru has become a major source country for Brazilian-bound cocaine, which is typically transported in planes to Bolivia en route to Brazil. A portion of that cocaine feeds the domestic market, while the rest is sent on to Europe and Asia. An investigation by a Brazilian journalist found that traffickers from Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay had over the last 14 years formed the most powerful drug trafficking alliance in the world, which he dubbed ""Narcosur."" This phenomenon is propelled by significant domestic drug markets in South American countries such as Argentina and Brazil, and lucrative markets in Europe and Asia, accessed via trafficking routes from South America. Peru is currently the world's largest coca and cocaine producer, driven by corruption and the presence of transnational criminal groups. Increased law enforcement efforts in Mexico and Colombia have pushed criminal groups to expand operations into Peru, where the risk of interdiction is lower and corruption is rampant. One of the groups that appears to have taken root in Peru is Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. A 7.6 ton cocaine shipment seized in the Peruvian province of La Libertad in August was attributed to the group , leading to the arrest of two alleged Sinaloa operatives working in the country. According to Mexico's Attorney General's Office , as of 2012 the Tijuana Cartel also maintained a presence in the country. In addition, US investigators have uncovered links between Peruvian criminal groups and Mexico's Zetas. Peru's status as the world's number one cocaine producer has drawn so-called ""drug mules"" from other countries, often motivated by poverty, as the Embassy's survey suggests. According to Peruvian police , the majority of the ""mules"" detained at Lima's international airport in the first 10 months of 2011 were foreigners. In 2012 Peruvian authorities detained 248 ""drug mules"" in the Jorge Chavez International Airport, the majority of whom were Spanish, Peruvian, and Mexican."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexican Drug Cartels Arming Gangs in Costa Rica: Official. Mexican drug cartels are reportedly arming gangs in Costa Rica with high-caliber weaponry, perhaps an indication that the Mexican criminals are shifting operations from countries under intense security pressure to those with weaker drug interdiction and law enforcement capabilities. On November 13, Costa Rica's Attorney General Jorge Chavarria announced Mexican drug cartels are giving criminal groups within the country AK-47s and grenades in order to destroy rival drug gangs, reported La Nacion. The Costa Rican gangs are involved in aerial, overland, and maritime drug-smuggling operations, reported El Universal. Chavarria did not specify which Mexican criminal groups are arming local gangs. However, according to La Nacion the Sinaloa Cartel has had a presence in Costa Rica since 2006, and the Knights Templar is also reportedly active in the country. The statement comes less than one week after Costa Rica's Public Security Minister Celso Gamboa announced the country has seized nearly 23 tons of cocaine so far this year, more than any other country in Central America. Costa Rica's Public Security Minister told El Universal the presence of Mexican cartels in Costa Rica is ""undeniable"". The reported arming of local gangs by Mexican drug cartels signals the on-going evolution of drug transit points in Central America. It is consistent with the strategy of Mexican organized crime groups to establish operations in countries unprepared to combat transnational drug trafficking. For years, Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) have used the ""Northern Triangle"" region (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras) as transshipment points for Colombian cocaine being trafficked through Central America before reaching Mexico and the United States. In response to rising levels of crime and violence in these countries, some governments have adopted an iron fist (""mano dura"") security strategy , putting greater pressure on both local street gangs and foreign DTOs. As a result, criminal groups in some countries traditionally unaffected by the transnational drug trade -- such as Costa Rica, which has no standing army -- have been ""colonized"" by Mexican drug trafficking groups. The infiltration of Mexican cartels into Costa Rica is not a new phenomenon. While Colombian drug trafficking groups historically controlled the trafficking routes through Costa Rica, since as early as 2011 regional security experts have documented the increased presence of Mexican DTOs in the country. Costa Rica took steps under current President Laura Chinchilla to combat organized crime by investing in several law-enforcement agencies designed to fight DTOs and signing a bi-lateral maritime surveillance agreement with the United States. However, the recent remarks by the country's Public Security Minister stating Costa Rica has seized more cocaine than any other Central American nation in 2014 -- highlighted by a 2 ton haul in July -- suggest government efforts to limit the presence of foreign drug trafficking groups remain inadequate."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Arrest of Key Operative Points to Growing PCC Presence in Paraguay. Authorities in Paraguay have arrested an alleged key member of Brazil's PCC gang, shedding light on the organization's growing operations in the border region between the two countries. Ledson Moura da Silva, alias ""Ledinho,"" was captured on June 2 in the city of Pedro Juan Caballero, on Paraguay's northern border with Brazil. He was reportedly one of Brazil's 10 most wanted suspects and is accused of homicide, attempted homicide and drug trafficking, reported ABC. Moura da Silva is also wanted for drug trafficking in Venezuela, Colombia and Bolivia and is being investigated for his possible connection with the May 16 murder of journalist Fausto Alcaraz Garay , who was killed in Pedro Juan Caballero. According to Crispulo Sotelo, Paraguay's antinarcotics police chief , Moura da Silva ran First Capital Command (PCC) operations in the border region, from where he sent shipments of cocaine and marijuana back to Brazil. He also allegedly managed some of the PCC's bank accounts in Brazil. In a search of his home in Pedro Juan Caballero, Paraguayan authorities discovered receipts for large deposits into Brazilian bank accounts under different names, which led them to believe that Ledinho used five different identities to manage the PCC accounts. Prior to living in Paraguay, Ledinho reportedly controlled drug trafficking operations in a neighborhood in the city of Cariacica in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo, where he has been linked to at least one murder. Paraguay is the biggest producer of marijuana in South America and a major transshipment point for cocaine headed to Brazil. The country grows roughly 30,000 tons of marijuana every year , of which an estimated 80 percent is sold in Brazil, according to the US State Department. Brazilian drug gangs have set up shop in the border region, which according to Brazilian police allows them to control the drug trade in the area without having to pay intermediaries. The PCC -- one of Brazil's most powerful criminal groups -- is among those that have been found to operate in Paraguay, with members previously captured in the city of Pedro Juan Caballero. The arrest of an apparently powerful member of the group there is further evidence of this growing connection. In addition to managing PCC operations in the area, Moura da Silva -- who had reportedly moved to Paraguay a month prior to his arrest -- may have been hiding from Brazilian authorities. According to Amambay Digital (a newspaper from the state where Pedro Juan Caballero is located), this city has become a refuge for criminals escaping from Brazil."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
"Honduras Indigenous, Tribal Lands Hard-Hit by Drug Trade. Recent reports have identified indigenous groups in Honduras as some of the most affected by the expansion of drug trafficking operations, illustrating the debilitating effects criminal migration and weak law enforcement have on one of the region's most vulnerable populations. Drug trafficking groups in Honduras are taking over tribal lands and clearing them to make clandestine landing strips for drug flights, cutting off indigenous access to areas used to obtain food and sustain a traditional lifestyle, reported Al Jazeera. Tribal leaders interviewed by Al Jazeera said there were at least 39 operational landing strips on their land, some of which received two to three flights a week. The presence of drug trafficking groups has also led to an increase in deforestation perpetrated by ranchers, palm oil growers and loggers in areas previously protected by local tribes, including wilderness reserves, the news report said. It is a regional phenomenon. A study published in Science magazine in January found that drug trafficking had accelerated deforestation in parts of Central America, with deforestation ""hot spots"" corresponding to drug transit hubs in several areas including eastern Honduras. The Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve in eastern Honduras -- which is home to three different indigenous groups -- has been especially hard-hit by drug trafficking. In 2011, UNESCO placed the area on its World Heritage List in Danger due to logging, fishing, and land occupation by suspected traffickers operating in the area. There are many reasons these areas are attractive to traffickers. First, they are remote. There are few roads to the Mosquito Coast, the area along the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua and Honduras covered in the Al Jazeera report. Most traffic moves via a series of rivers or along the coastline. The remoteness of the area has also contributed to the increase in drug flights coming from South America. Second, the indigenous groups have established their communities in rural areas, have little state presence and distrust authorities. For all of these reasons, the chances the groups will complain to the police or the military are small. Third, security crackdowns in Mexico have led to an increase in drug trafficking through Central America , with the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador especially impacted by organized crime and violence. Fourth, Honduras, as a whole, is very unstable, corrupt and has incredibly weak institutions. Political instability created by a 2009 military coup that ousted President Manuel Zelaya exacerbated the situation , further debilitating an already weak state presence. Honduras is currently the most violent country in the world outside a war zone, with the United Nations reporting a 2012 homicide rate of 90.4 per 100,000, and has a significant presence of drug trafficking organizations. An estimated 140 to 300 tons of cocaine are believed to transit through the country each year."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Panama Security Officials Implicated in International Arms Trafficking Network. Authorities in Panama are asking the United States for assistance in investigating an international arms trafficking network that may have included the participation of former security officials, raising questions about the country's role in the regional arms trafficking trade. Prosecutors in Panama have asked for two US judicial assistants to participate in an international arms trafficking investigation that implicates several former officials from the Central American nation's Public Security Directorate (Direccion Institucional de Asuntos de Seguridad Publica - DIASP), La Prensa reported October 12. Authorities are investigating nine individuals, eight of whom are former DIASP officials, for their alleged role in importing 100 weapons into Panama after they were purchased in the United States, according to a number of press releases from the Attorney General's Office. The investigation was recently extended six months to ""analyze"" whether or not the head of the DIASP, Ovidio Fuentes, was also involved in the network, La Prensa reported. Fuentes has been temporarily suspended from the DIASP while the investigation continues. So far, prosecutors have been able to recover at least 40 of the weapons imported into Panama from the United States, including an AR-15 assault rifle and various grenades, according to La Prensa. The network reportedly purchased the weapons for between $149 and $540 each in the United States before they were sold to unidentified local merchants in Panama at a marked up value between $5,500 and $7,500. Prosecutors allege the weapons were purchased between 2016 and 2017. However, the weapons reportedly had permits listed for 2012, suggesting that this information was altered by DIASP officials, who are responsible for providing the proper permits and certifications for imported firearms, according to a 2012 firearms law. The 2012 law also says that only authorized security personnel can import firearms into Panama. The recent arms trafficking investigation in Panama raises more questions than answers. The country has long been known as a money laundering haven that criminal groups throughout the region, including Colombia's notorious Medellin Cartel, have used to wash billions in criminal proceeds, rather than a final destination for illegally trafficked firearms. Guns, especially from the United States, remain a driving force behind violence in Latin America. But Panama consistently has one of the region's lowest homicide rates, suggesting that the firearms imported into the country may have been moving on to another country. Indeed, Central America has long been a key source and transit region for illegal firearms moving to countries in South America, such as Colombia, according to a 2006 report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) on arms trafficking in Colombia. In particular, the UNODC found that Panama acts as the ""principal port of entry"" for illicit firearms from the United States and Central America that are traveling into the Andean nation due to its free port status and geographically strategic location bordering Colombia."	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
Homemade Guns Point to Perus Gang Struggles. Police in Peru's capital seized a cache of guns apparently made out of iron pipes by local street gangs, illustrative of how the intense, highly localized conflict between neighborhood gangs has pushed even the most low-level groups to arm themselves. Lima police reported seizing the nine homemade pistols -- iron pipes crudely welded together into 'T' shapes -- after breaking up a gang fight in the northern district of Comas. A youth fleeing the scene dropped a backpack containing the handmade weapons and a box of .38 calibre bullets. Police said that one of the crude weapons could be made for around 30 soles (about $11), and could be bought on the black market for between 2 to 3 soles (about 77 cents to $1.15), reports Peru 21. As InSight Crime has reported , Peru's government has said there are a total of 13,000 gang members inside the country, compared to an estimated 14,000 gang members in Guatemala and 10,500 in El Salvador, both of which have much smaller populations than Peru. According to a report by Infosur , more than 12,000 of these estimated gang members are based in Lima and the nearby port city Callao. The approximate 430 gangs in the region are also known to arm themselves with machetes, whips, stones, and metal, the report states. The apparently primitive state of the weaponry used by some of Lima's gangs is a symptom of their essentially petty nature. While there are homegrown groups in Peru's rural jungles involved in organized criminal activities like the transnational trafficking of drugs, urban gangs have not yet established any significant connections to organized crime. Such links allow gangs to access bigger profits and better weaponry. In contrast, ties between elements of the Mara Salvatrucha ( MS-13 ) and organized crime has allowed the group to significantly expand their arsenal if not their criminal purview. And while Peruvian gangs are capable of great violence in Lima -- some of it related to the fight over extortion -- so far there is little evidence that they have ties to international drug trafficking networks. The Lima-based gangs are not the only ones scrappy enough to resort to DIY weaponry. A 2010 video report by Colombian TV network Caracol shows youth groups in an impoverished Bogota neighborhood making their own guns out of metal scraps and duct tape.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"How Much Is Guatemala Arming the Zetas?Guatemala admits that its military has trained and even armed violent Mexican drug gangs like the Zetas. But just how far are Guatemala's criminal networks, born of Cold War death squads and spy units, responsible for supplying the Mexicans with weapons? Speaking at a drug enforcement conference in Cancun, Guatemala's Vice Minister of Security Mario Castanada admitted to three known cases of drug traffickers stealing weapons from military arsenals. According to a report by newswire EFE , Castanada did not specify when or where these robberies took place. Presumably among the cases he was referring to was one documented in March 2009 , when authorities found weapons at a Zetas training camp in the northern Quiche department. The stash was later traced to a military warehouse in the capital. When the police raided another alleged Zetas warehouse outside the capital in April 2009, they found more weapons from the same source. These included nearly 600 grenades, eleven machine guns and 5,000 rounds of ammunition, stored in boxes labeled ""Guatemalan Military Industry."" Police also found landmines and military uniforms during the raid. The Zetas are thought to have obtained these weapons from the Mariscal Zavala military base, in sales (or theft) that took place between July 2007 and January 2008. On August 20, 2009, the Zetas reportedly stole another arms shipment, including rocket and grenade launchers, that were apparently traveling overland in Guatemala, reports La Jornada. Guatemala's weapons black market is mostly controlled by shadowy criminal organizations evolved from the Cold War-era security forces. These include active and retired military and government officials, who worked together in counter-insurgency, intelligence, special forces, and the death squads. Sometimes compared to a clandestine security apparatus or a parallel state, these operatives are described as the "" hidden forces "" running the country's criminal networks: extortion, kidnapping, money laundering, smuggling migrants, drug trafficking, and the illicit arms trade. The political and military ties of the Illegal Corps and Clandestine Security Apparatus (Cuerpos Ilegales y Aparatos Clandestinos de Seguridad - CIACS), as the group is known, differentiates the organization from traditional smugglers like Juan Chamale or the Lorenzanas , as well as street gangs MS-13 and Barrio 18. The connections between the CIACS and Mexican gangs like the Zetas are well known. Rogue members of the Kaibiles, or Guatemalan Special Forces, can earn up to $5,000 a month training the Zetas in combat, the Guatemalan security minister said this week in Cancun. The question of how far Guatemalan arsenals are arming Mexican groups may have indirect implications for U.S. policy regarding gun trafficking to Mexico. When the U.S. Government Accountability Office reported in June 2009 that over 90 percent of the arms seized in Mexico (and that authorities were able to trace) were traced to the United States, debate flared on both sides of the border. Mexico pointed to U.S. complicity in the so-called ""drugs war,"" with gun stores in border states arming gangs like the Zetas, as documented in InSight's GunRunners project. The argument that Mexican groups are instead obtaining Guatemalan weapons could prove attractive for U.S. political interests seeking to justify lax gun laws. But identifying the greater source of arms for Mexican cartels -- Guatemala or the U.S. -- means relying on estimates and statistics that still seem fuzzy. As reported by the AFP , one top U.S. military official recently suggested that Mexican groups are arming themselves mostly from Central American arsenals. During testimony before the U.S. Senate on March 30, General Douglas Fraser, head of the U.S. Southern Command, said, ""Over 50 percent of the military-type weapons that are flowing throughout the region have a large source between Central American stockpiles, if you will, left over from wars and conflicts in the past."" This seems to echo statements reportedly made in a U.S. Diplomatic cable which Mexican news daily La Jornada said it exclusively obtained from whistleblower site WikiLeaks. According to the newspaper, the cable, reference ID 09Mexico808, was drafted as a briefing for ATF agents following an arms trafficking conference on April 1-2, 2009. The cable says that 90 percent of high-power weapons submitted by Mexico law enforcement to the U.S. for tracing were in fact linked to Central American arsenals, the newspaper reports. La Jornada has not yet made this cable available. Mexican groups have doubtlessly obtained AK-47s and grenades from Cold War arsenals in Guatemala, and even El Salvador. But breaking down the origins of Mexico's arms supply, in order to assign political responsibility for the gun trafficking problem, will likely prove fruitless. What is clear is that the U.S. has a set of laws that are indirectly feeding weapons into the hands of Mexican gangs, while in Guatemala the problem is more akin to a lack of proper law enforcement. Addressing the weapons trade means confronting impunity within Guatemala's police and army. But that country's Congress and executive branch have often proved powerless to take on the shadowy forces still controlling the region's illicit arms networks. One indication: the Arms and Munitions Law, which took ten years to draft and which was finally implemented in 2009, reduced the number of guns a person could carry from twelve to three. ""The law seems to have been designed to aid the dirty business of arms trafficking,"" observed a member of Congress in a December 2010, as quoted in a report by the Woodrow Wilson Center. It is clear that both Guatemala and the U.S. are prime sources of weapons for Mexican gangs. Measuring how much seems less important than addressing the laws in both countries that aid the ""dirty business."" "	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Mexican State Police Seek Increased Firepower. As Mexico's drug war heats up, local police officers often find themselves outgunned by drug gangs, many of which have purchased combat arms at U.S. gun shops and shows, or - in some cases - stolen them from police stockpiles. Now, however, Mexico's governors are fighting back. As Mexico's El Milenio reports, since 2009 the country's Secretariat of National Defense (Secretaria de la Defensa Nacional - SEDENA) has received requests from at least nine state governments for hand grenades in order to give their local police forces an edge in the war on drugs. The defense agency has already given hand grenades to police in several states, including Zacatecas, Guerrero, Coahuila and Yucatan. On the waiting list for the explosives are Guanajuato, Jalisco, and Veracruz, which are expected to arm some local police with grenades by the end of the year. Hand grenades are not the only comparative advantage that state governments are seeking. As the Associated Press reported in 2008, governors are also trying to get higher caliber rifles for their security forces, as well as more ammunition. Their adversaries, foot soldiers of Mexico's cartels, are often equipped with .50 caliber sniper rifles, AK-47 variants, and body armor. Although Mexican Federal Police and state police in Chihuahua, Jalisco, Chiapas and Guerrero use AR-15 and G36 assault rifles, most municipal and state police in Mexico are armed with shotguns or .38 caliber pistols, which hardly compete with the heavy arsenals of drug gangs. As more states seek to beef up their security arms stockpiles, however, there is a risk that some of these weapons will actually end up in the hands of the cartels they're meant to fight. Since the beginning of Mexico's war on organized crime, dozens of police weapons have been ""lost,"" likely ending up in the country's black market for arms. According to El Milenio , 156 handguns and 97 rifles have gone missing from state police arsenals since 2009. The largest number of lost weapons is in Chihuahua, where a total of 36 pistols and 57 high-powered rifles have simply vanished in the past two years. Ultimately, the Mexican military is a fairly insignificant source of weapons for the cartels. As InSight has described in its GunRunners report , the majority of these weapons come from the United States. In the four years that Felipe Calderon has been president of Mexico , his government has seized more than 93,000 weapons, close to 90 percent of which come from gun stores in U.S. border states like Texas, Arizona and New Mexico. The most popular of these weapons is a knockoff of the AK-47, the Romanian-made WASR-10. These semi-automatic rifles are readily available in many American gun stores, despite U.S. restrictions on the importation of assault weapons. In the end, the biggest factor in keeping these rifles out of the hands of Mexico's drug gangs is limited oversight that government agencies have over arms dealers. Unless something is done to control access to assault weapons in many of the 6,700 gun stores along the southern border, Mexican police will continue to face cartel gunmen armed to the teeth.

"Colombian Crime Groups Export Loan Sharking to Peru. Authorities in Peru are warning about the involvement of Colombian crime groups in loan sharking, suggesting these organizations are expanding their participation in this activity outside of their home country. In an article published by La Republica on October 16, police officials told the news outlet that investigations have detected a criminal activity known as ""gota a gota"" (drop by drop) in nearly 100 cities across Peru, and that authorities have linked some of these operations to Colombian crime groups like the Urabenos, the Oficina de Envigado and La Empresa. Agents from the Criminal Investigation Directorate (Direccion de Investigacion Criminal - DIRINCRI) told La Republica that ""gota a gota"" consists of lending small sums of money at high interest rates -- sometimes up to 100 percent -- to people who have trouble obtaining traditional loans, like small business owners, housewives, and students. ""Gota a gota"" loans are usually made on a short-term basis, and repayment is typically expected within 20 days. If borrowers fail to pay back the loan and the accumulated interest, the lenders often threaten, beat or even kill the debtors. ""These subjects, when they first engage with the customers, appear friendly and sympathetic in order to ingratiate themselves with the clients,"" said Luis Montoya, the former director general of Peru's National Police (Policia Nacional del Peru - PNP). ""However, when [borrowers] are slow to pay, they are first threatened and even beaten and [the lenders] begin to operate as true mafias."" Colombian law enforcement has detected ""gota a gota"" operations in more than 180 municipalities in that country, and similar operations run by Colombian crime groups have been uncovered in several other nations throughout Latin America, including Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador and Honduras. Loan sharking activities like ""gota a gota"" hold a number of attractions for Colombian criminal organizations. For one, these schemes allow crime groups to launder the proceeds of other illegal activities in a way that earns them further profits. And expanding these activities to other countries makes illicit financial flows even harder for authorities to detect. As InSight Crime has previously pointed out , this relatively low-risk criminal activity fills a real void for the majority of Latin American citizens who lack access to formal banking. However, this illicit business is often accompanied by violence, and it helps feed the coffers of criminal organizations that engage in even more nefarious activities. The Peruvian-Colombian criminal nexus dates back decades; former Peruvian spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos sold weapons to Colombian rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) in the late 1990s. Still, the expansion of grass-roots criminal activities such as ""gota a gota"" in Peru and other countries in Latin America could serve as another indication of a pattern InSight Crime has previously highlighted: the migration of Colombian criminals throughout the region. Not only are Colombian crime organizations apparently attempting to evade increased pressure from law enforcement in their home country, they also seem to be seeking control over key criminal economies abroad."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Top Money Launderer for El Chapo Captured in Mexico. Authorities in Mexico captured an alleged top money launderer for Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, but his arrest is unlikely to have a significant impact on the criminal organization's drug trafficking operations and revenue streams. On March 27, Mexican Federal Police announced via Twitter the capture of Juan Manuel Alvarez Inzunza, alias ""El Rey Midas."" In addition to working for El Chapo, authorities say Alvarez Inzunza laundered drug money for fellow Sinaloa Cartel leader Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias ""El Mayo,"" reported El Universal. Authorities estimate that Alvarez Inzunza laundered between $300 and $400 million annually for the Sinaloa Cartel, which comes out to more than $4 billion over the last decade. Alvarez Inzunza was arrested on a provisional extradition warrant for money laundering charges issued by a US District Court Judge in Washington, DC. He was captured in the southern state of Oaxaca while on vacation with his family. In an official statement following the arrest, federal authorities said they are able to link the presumed Sinaloa Cartel operator to a money laundering network with domestic links to the cities of Tijuana, Culiacan and Guadalajara and with international links to Colombia, Panama and the United States. Alvarez Inzunza allegedly used shell businesses and currency exchange houses in the states of Jalisco and Sinaloa to launder illicit funds. Although authorities have identified Alvarez Inzunza as a top financial operator for the Sinaloa Cartel, it's doubtful his arrest will jeopardize the financial viability of a criminal organization widely considered to be the most prolific drug trafficking network in the Western Hemisphere. The cartel functions more as a horizontal network of federated cells than a vertically integrated organization. This business model enables the cartel to run its operations with relative stability and avoid volatility following the arrest of a high-ranking figure. Even El Chapo's capture in February 2014, the world's most wanted drug trafficker at the time, barely made a dent in the cartel's revenue streams. In fact, the biggest consequence of Alvarez Inzunza's arrest might only be seen if and when he is extradited to the United States. Prosecutors could offer him a reduced sentence in exchange for valuable intelligence information on the cartel's financial structure and drug trafficking operations."	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Arrest Shows Money Laundering Practices Die Hard. The recent arrest of two Mexican nationals in Colombia illustrates that old money laundering practices die hard, an investigative report by the Tijuana-based Zeta says. Omar Guadalupe Ayon Diaz and Osvaldo Contreras Arriaga were arrested in Cartagena, Colombia , on August 19, Zeta reported, and charged with money laundering and criminal conspiracy, among other charges. The two men, identified as members of the Sinaloa Cartel, are also wanted by Interpol and both the US and Mexico's Attorney Generals' Offices. It's not clear where they will be tried. Drawing from the US indictment of the two men, Zeta says that Ayon Diaz and Contreras Arriaga used multiple ""casas de cambio,"" currency exchange houses, in Tijuana to launder money tied to the Sinaloa Cartel's drug trafficking. In less than two years, Ayon Diaz and Contreras Arriaga laundered over 45 million dollars, the report says. Much of this was accomplished by transferring illicit financial earnings between Mexico and United States banks. Intelligence officials told Zeta that Ayon Diaz and Contreras Arriaga also worked directly for the Lira Sotelo family, known drug traffickers since 2007. There are a couple of surprises in the Zeta report. The first is the continued use of ""casas de cambio."" While once a common strategy in money laundering amongst Latin American drug trafficking organizations, it was thought to be out of style, and something that was too well known and therefore too risky for the criminal groups. However, by all appearances, Tijuana remains a hub of this sort of activity. As the Zeta report says, there are approximately three hundred currency exchange centers in Tijuana , a fourth of all exchange houses in all of Mexico. SEE MORE: Sinaloa Cartel News and Profiles Mexico's weak legislation facilitates this practice. By exchanging money in sums smaller than $500, drug trafficking organizations are able to move financial resources without governmental oversight. The second surprise in the report was the way in which Ayon Diaz and Contreras Arriagas operated seemingly independently. While the report says they managed some of the Sinaloa Cartel 's drug trafficking proceeds, it also says they had a relationship with the Lira Sotelo family, which was an affiliate of the Tijuana Cartel. The Tijuana and Sinaloa Cartels battled for control of that border city for years. Sinaloa was thought to have won that fight, but it appears to have accommodated at least some of its vanquished foes."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Peru Takes on Big Apple Transnational Drug Money Laundering Ring. Police in Peru are targeting a transnational money laundering network they claim could be linked to cartels in Mexico, in a rare move against a multi-billion dollar criminal industry that is firmly established in the country. Peruvian authorities have frozen 50 bank accounts and seized 37 properties and 24 vehicles, together worth around $7 million, in an operation targeting a money laundering network dubbed ""La Gran Manzana"" (the Big Apple) -- a reference to the names of the front companies they allegedly used to launder drug money, reported the Associated Press. Police have identified a Peruvian couple believed to head the network and three Colombian associates, who remain at large. According to investigators, the group used front companies that imported computer games and equipment from Spain and the United States to move cash and launder proceeds (see police chart below). Authorities have connected the ring to several Peruvian drug trafficking operations broken up in recent years -- including one in which an uncle of one of the Peruvian leaders was arrested for alleged involvement in an attempt to export nearly four tons of cocaine to Spain. Police also said they may be linked to Mexican groups the Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas, reported La Republica. While the Peruvian police are keen to portray ""La Gran Manzana"" as part of a major coordinated criminal structure involved in transnational drug trafficking, it is more likely they are a specialist operation offering financial services to drug traffickers. In Peru, drug trafficking remains for the most part in the hands of small criminal clans who act as suppliers for transnational operations, such as the Mexican cartels. Given the size of the seizures -- which, while not insignificant, pale in comparison to other operations seen around the region -- it is likely the network repatriated drug profits in Peru on behalf of these clans, rather than working directly with Mexican groups or other major transnational operations. The police operation is a rare success against money laundering in Peru. However, it represents a minor blow against an industry that launders around $8 billion of illegal funds a year, according to the estimates of Peru's anti-drug prosecutor, Sonia Medina. Within the country, there is very little resistance to the laundering of money from the drug trade and other illegal activities -- such as illegal mining and extortion. The money often passes through poorly regulated small businesses such as hotels and casinos."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Jamaican Police Target $300 Million of Drug Trade Assets. Jamaican authorities are targeting over $300 million dollars worth of alleged narco-properties in the western part of the island, reportedly linked to a resurgent cocaine trade. The Jamaican Financial Investigations Division (FID) is targeting high-end properties they believe were acquired through an international drug trafficking and money laundering network that connects Central and North America with the Caribbean, reported the Gleaner. The investigation began in the United States with the arrest of two Jamaican brothers caught attempting to smuggle in six kilos of cocaine. Authorities believe the assets are linked to operations capitalizing on a resurgent cocaine trade in Jamaica, especially along the western coast. As well as being the largest marijuana supplier country in the Caribbean, Jamaica is also a transit point for cocaine trafficked from South America to North America or Europe. While only an estimated five percent of cocaine destined for the United States passes through the Caribbean region, there have been increased fears that trafficking is again on the rise due to a clampdown on popular routes in Central America. Additionally, the CIA has identified ""substantial"" money laundering activity in Jamaica , and have described the island as a favored spot for Colombian drug traffickers to carry out illegal financial transactions. There has been a dramatic increase in asset seizures in Jamaica since 2007, when the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) was enacted, giving the state powers to seize property and finances obtained through drug trafficking and/or money laundering."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Guatemalas Top Prosecutor Talks Successful Tactics. Guatemala's widely-praised attorney general says her office is now focused on breaking up criminal networks rather than just solving individual crimes, and that the strategy is paying off. Claudia Paz y Paz spoke to elPeriodico at the midpoint of her four-year term. She said that as head of the Public Ministry, she helped implement a new investigative approach which has saved some 500 lives. According to Paz, in 2012 the ministry began emphasizing the investigation of wider criminal networks, instead of focusing on individual criminals. This led the ministry to target neighborhoods where street gangs the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 are active, resulting in the capture of some 300 alleged members of these two groups, Paz said. Paz also praised several attempts to attack the finances of Guatemala's criminal organizations. She pointed to the Asset Confiscation Law, passed the day before she came to office in December 2010, which has allowed her office to seize some 150 million quetzales ($19 million). She said that the law not only facilitates the seizure of assets from criminals, but allows these assets to be funnelled back into the fight against crime, specifically into the units which prosecute organized crime, trafficking, and money laundering. Guatemala has seen some significant improvements. Its murder rate is on the decline, with 2012 the least violent year since 2004, according to official figures , giving it a rate of some 35 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. Paz's tactics have been given substantial credit for this decrease in violence, and indeed she recently announced that the rate of impunity in murder cases had gone dropped to 70 percent, compared to 95 percent in 2009. The efforts to battle the finances of organized criminal groups may prove crucial for further security improvements as Guatemala moves forward, as Paz highlighted in her interview. The country's anti-money laundering measures have been criticized for their weakness , with no state body having the legal tools to fully investigate suspicious transactions. In order to intensify Guatemala's fight against money laundering, Paz said that the Public Ministry would quadruple the number of financial auditors who work for the office. Another success cited by Paz, the Law Against Illicit Enrichment, may also prove crucial for Guatemala's future improvements in security, if it is indeed enforced. The anti-corruption measure, passed by Congress in October, imposes tougher punishments for corrupt politicians.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Colombia Seizes $5 Million in Fake US Bills. Officials seized some $5.7 million in fake dollars in central Colombia, calling attention to the country's counterfeit currency trade. The seizure took place in Pereira, capital of Risaralda province, reported EFE. The cash, printed in 100-dollar bills, was reportedly meant for distribution in Colombian cities. No arrests were reported. Authorities also recently dismantled a factory in Medellin, Antioquia, that produced some $85,000 in fake bills , as well as pirated books. Colombia was once the world's top producer of fake dollars, responsible for some 43 percent of the world's counterfeit supply. However, Colombia was surpassed by Peru circa 2009. Much of the counterfeit business was once based in the southwest city of Cali, where forgers worked in sophisticated factories and workshops. Recent seizures in Colombia's coffee-growing heartland, including Risaralda and Medellin, are an indication that the business may have been displaced from its traditional home in the southwest Pacific. While the business of counterfeiting money usually benefits organized criminal groups, who use the fake currency to fund their business activities, the forgery rings themselves are usually independent operations made up of experts, who do not work exclusively for any single organization. The industry is not restricted to dollars and Colombian pesos. On Friday, authorities announced the dismantling of two counterfeit currency production centers in Bogota which also produced euros and British pounds. The operation was carried out in collaboration with Interpol, and 14 people were arrested. 	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Colombian Kingpin to Reveal Details of Ties with Mexican Cartels. Julio Alberto Lozano, alias ""Patricia,"" accused by Colombian authorities of being one of the hemisphere's most important drug traffickers, has agreed to face charges in the United States. After Lozano's legal team reached a negotiation with the US Justice Department, he was brought to the country on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering, reported El Tiempo. Lozano first came under police scrutiny after a dozen suitcases full of money, allegedly belonging to him, were found in the Colombian cities of Bogota and Buenaventura in an apparent money laundering scheme involving a Bogota soccer club. Since then, Colombian police have launched an offensive against Lazano's business network, arresting seven people in Miami, Panama, Mexico, and Argentina, including Luis Agustin Caicedo, his personal associate. According to authorities, Lozano is a leader of an international drug-trafficking network in charge of collecting money from different criminal organizations around the continent and turning it over to Daniel Barrera Barrera, alias ""El Loco,"" one of Colombia's top drug kingpins. Barrera in turn used the money to purchase cocaine from the FARC guerrillas. Because of his role as ""middle man,"" Lozano's testimony could be a key piece of intelligence for US officials seeking to understand the connections between cocaine producers in Colombia and cartels in Mexico.

"Showtimes The Trade Explores Criminal Networks Tied to Migration. The second season of Showtime's The Trade comes out March 6, and this time around the award-winning documentary series is doing a deep-dive into the criminal activities surrounding Central American migration to the United States. The four-part series jumps around to various families facing the different challenges that occur at each step of the migration process, whether that be escaping the violence of the Northern Triangle, walking thousands of miles through Mexico or making a new life in the US. ""I hope people understand a little more about what migrants have to go through,"" producer Monica Villamizar told InSight Crime. ""There are all these people showing up to the US border and you ask, 'Why?' 'What's going on?' This will really tell you in a way that's never been done before."" At first, some of the footage might feel similar to the many other migration documentaries and news stories that have come out over the years. The first episode opens on the US-Mexico border wall in dramatic light. Later there's the out-of-breath border agents chasing down migrants, the tattooed MS13 gang members in handcuffs, and of course, the wide-angle shots of people atop ""the beast"" train as it pushes through dangerous parts of Mexico. However, the series quickly pivots to more unique subject matter, placing all of these experiences in the context of organized crime--and with access most documentaries would salivate at. One of the central figures of this season is Magda. For years, her husband worked as a ""trigger man"" for MS13 in San Pedro Sula, the murder capital of Honduras. When her husband decided to leave the gang and straighten out his life, they killed him and issued near-constant threats against Magda. ""Justice?"" She asks, in reference to her husband's killer, who everyone in the community knows. ""That doesn't exist here."" The show follows her on the long, arduous journey to the United States, showing some of the smaller, moment-to-moment challenges that it entails. What roads will best avoid Mexican drug cartels? Where is there access to a doctor? Can the other migrants traveling nearby be trusted? Much of the series takes place in McAllen, Texas, a popular crossing-point for Central American migrants. Ramirez, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, is looking into a small-scale smuggling operation. He stakes out a ""stash house"" near the border, where migrants hide out until smugglers can move them to their next destination. While searching the premises, Ramirez finds condom wrappers strewn about the floor, suggesting that the stash house is being used for sex trafficking. He tracks down the caretaker of the house, and then after some investigation, Gerardo Naranjo-Chavez, alias ""Express,"" the leader. But Express is not the only one investigated for human trafficking in this series. Almost every episode makes a point of showing how the vulnerability of migrants can put them at risk of sex work and other forms of exploitation. Later in the series, a woman named Sochil discusses her childhood experience with Luz del Mundo, a Mexican megachurch whose leaders molested and raped her. ""My aunt made it seem like it was normal,"" Sochil says, ""that it was a blessing, because they instill it in your brain. They engrave it in your brain."" The storyline feels a bit extraneous considering that it has little to do with migration, but that can be forgiven considering the gravity of the topic. Luz del Mundo has millions of followers despite the leaders' numerous charges of extortion, forcible rape of a minor, production of child pornography and human trafficking. At the very least, the storyline shows how easily vulnerable demographics of Latin America can be coerced into situations of exploitation, many of which go unchecked because the culprits hold positions of power. The series does an excellent job of explaining the various criminal activities that both fuel, and develop out of, the wave of migrants heading toward the United States from Central America. Its footage of gang violence in Honduras accurately depicts how a lack of economic opportunity in the country continues to drive young men to join gangs like MS13. ""The gang gives them three meals a day,"" one pastor in Honduras says. ""They provide them love and respect. But once they are inside they realize this is not what they signed up for."" Magda's story, the constant fear in which she lived following her husband's death, may provide some viewers with a deeper understanding of how a person can arrive at the decision to leave home and embark on such a perilous journey. That journey, the series shows, is much more complex than making it safely from point A to point B. Coyotes charge thousands of dollars so they can bribe law enforcement and cartels, as well as pay truck drivers who in one episode receive $1,000 for every migrant they transport in their trailers. For viewers who only understand migration through annual statistics and hot-button political talking points, these kinds of details may prove revelatory. The show's focus on human trafficking specifically, however, may leave the most lasting impact. There are nearly 25 million victims of human trafficking worldwide , many of them migrants who will never receive justice, and ""The Trade"" makes the rare effort of showing just how many different forms the crime can take. In every storyline, the series highlights the ineffectiveness and, in some cases, unfairness built into the legal systems fighting all of these criminal activities. Whether waiting for the return of a nephew's body caught in bureaucratic limbo, a man facing deportation due to a tree he cut down in his yard, or officials rescinding police protection for a trafficking victim, the series offers more than enough to leave viewers feeling as frustrated about the situation as they are distraught."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Leader of Colombias FARC Announces Halt to Extortion. The leader of Colombia's FARC guerrillas has ordered members to stop charging its ""revolutionary tax,"" a symbolic end to the group's extortion practices that may prove difficult to enforce. Timoleon Jimenez, alias ""Timochenko,"" leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), made the announcement during an interview with Agencia de Prensa Rural. (See video below) ""I have just given the order to all FARC structures to stop the collection of taxes on all legal economic activity,"" Timochenko said. Timochenko justified the past imposition of these ""taxes,"" which were levied on ranchers and local businesses, as necessary to feed the FARC's thousands of fighters. The FARC and Colombian government are nearing the conclusion of a historic peace deal, and recently agreed to a bilateral ceasefire. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos hopes to have a final peace agreement signed by July 20. ""We believe we're nearing the end. We can live off what we have until we reach a final deal,"" Timochenko explained as the reasoning for the order to cease charging fees. Timochenko also told Prensa Rural the FARC stopped recruiting new members three months ago. He called on current members to study the peace accords agreed to thus far ahead of an internal FARC conference to discuss and approve the agreement. Timochenko's announcement that FARC members have been ordered to cease extorting local businesses and residents raises several questions. One is if he considers coca production a ""legal economic activity,"" and whether or not the FARC will continue collecting protection money from coca farmers and drug traffickers in areas it controls. Perhaps more importantly, however, is the dilemma of enforcing such a command. For instance, the FARC's militias -- estimated at 8,500, on top of the FARC's roughly 7,000 active fighters -- play a role in collecting the ""war tax"" from locals. Given their clandestine nature, there has been some concern over the full demobilization of such structures and their incorporation into agreed upon concentration zones for FARC fighters. As with drug trafficking, it is likely some dissident FARC elements will continue to seek profit by extorting local populaces after a final peace deal is signed. Nonetheless, the symbolic significance of Timochenko announcing an end to the FARC's taxing of locals should not be understated. The extortion of ranchers in particular has played a key role in Colombia's cyclical violence, being a main motivator for the formation and growth of Colombia's right-wing paramilitaries.

Massive Avocado Farm Extortion Highlights Mexico Vigilantes Cause. The Knights Templar and La Familia Michoacana took nearly 13 percent of profits from Mexico's national avocado production over the course of five years, demonstrating the type of criminal incursion into the local economy that spurred the rise of self-defense groups. Avocado producers in the municipality of Tancitaro, Michoacan, calculated that from 2009 to 2013 organized crime made around $770 million from the region's avocado business, or $154 million annually reported El Universal. Mexico's Ministry of Agricultural Development (Sagarpa) estimates national avocado production over the past five years has risen to a value of over $5.86 billion. Michoacan is the number one avocado producer in the world, supplying 85 percent of avocados consumed domestically and around 52 percent of the global supply. Tancitaro alone provides 25 percent of the international market's avocados, while, according to the Wall Street Journal , Michoacan is the source of four of every five avocados sold in the US. Criminal groups began to cash in on this market in 2009, according to El Universal, when La Familia Michoacana started extorting local avocado growers, killing farm hands and displacing farmers, and appropriating their property. By 2011 the Knights Templar had replaced La Familia in Michoacan, reportedly stealing 30 percent of avocado profits that year as exports exploded thanks to the inclusion of guacamole on the menus of Burger King and Subway in the United States. The vast quantity of money stolen from Michoacan's avocado growers through violence and extortion is a mark of how deeply involved in all aspects of society La Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar became. Instead of participating only in drug trafficking, these groups diversified their revenue streams , and began engaging in kidnapping , extorting, theft and the general harassment of local communities. It was this type of criminal activity affecting the economic and community life of residents, and not international drug trafficking or cartel turf wars, that was behind the rise of self-defense militias in Michoacan. These groups have now broken the stranglehold of the Knights Templar in much of the state, and have started to redistribute farmland stolen by the Knights. However, with reports surfacing of vigilante leaders failing to return properties confiscated from the Knights, and of them extorting other business sectors such as mining, avocado growers and others like them may find the demise of the Knights Templar only leaves them in the hands of a different armed power.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Kidnapped Costa Rican Diplomat Released in Caracas. A diplomat at the Costa Rican Embassy in Caracas has been found safe two days after he was kidnapped by gunmen, in the latest in a rash of attacks on high-profile individuals in Venezuela. Guillermo Cholele, trade attache at the Costa Rican Embassy in Caracas, was found with minor injuries after being released by his kidnappers on Tuesday morning. Enrique Castillo, Costa Rica's foreign minister, said the kidnappers' ransom demand had not been paid, according to El Nacional , while Venezuela's Interior Minister posted on his Twitter account , ""Through investigative work and political pressure we have liberated the Costa Rican diplomat."" Cholele was abducted Sunday in front of his home in the La Urbina neighborhood of Caracas. Cholele's kidnapping follows a series of attacks on high-profile individuals. The Mexican ambassador and his wife were held for several hours in an ""express kidnapping"" in Caracas in January , Chile's consul general was abducted and shot in the city in November 2011, while Major League Baseball catcher Wilson Ramos was kidnapped the same month. In March, the daughter of another Chilean diplomat was shot dead by police officers after her car drove through an unmarked security checkpoint in Maracaibo, Venezuela's second city. These incidents suggest that insecurity in Venezuela, which saw its most violent year on record in 2011, has reached the point where not even high-profile officials and sports stars, with access to private security, can avoid assault and abduction. Kidnapping is a serious problem in Venezuela for more than just diplomats. More than 1,000 kidnappings for ransom were registered in 2011. "	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Kidnappers: Diego Cevallos is an Operator of the Neoliberal Oligarchy. InSight Crime brings you part of statement issued Sunday by the Network for Global Transformation, a clandestine group that claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, a political operative of the National Action Party (PAN), who was released earlier this week. Fernandez de Cevallos refused to give any details about the group, other than to say that he'd been treated with ""warmth."" In earlier statements, the group identified itself as ""the ex-mysterious disappeared [ones]."" From the beginning, speculation was the group had more to do with organized crime than guerrillas. But the mystery of who the group is continues. The document, titled ""Epilogue of a Disappearance,"" gives some clues as to the group's thinking, if not its ideology. It is in three parts. This is part of the third part. See El Milenio newspaper's account for the full version in Spanish. Epilogue of a Disappearance : National sovereignty resides essentially and originally in the people. All power emanates from the people and is instituted for their benefit. At all times, the people have the inalienable right to alter or modify their form of government Diego Fernandez de Cevallos seemed untouchable until that night when his own dark past caught up to him. And, much to his regret, [he] had to answer [for] some of his actions and look in the mirror To make him a prisoner was our way of making him look in a mirror that reflected his own ways of being corrupt, arrogant, greedy and selfish, and demonstrating a fundamental fact: That if we as a people dare to fight against injustice, no felony will go unpunished. Diego Fernandez de Cevallos Ramos (DFCR) is one of the politicians who is most responsible for the sustained process of economic, political and social calamity the ruling elite has imposed and deployed in our country from 1982 to today, through a mafia network that operates inside and outside the state institutions; this process got worse under the criminal, neoliberal banner, making our already deteriorating living conditions of men and women living in Mexico even worse, [and] creating the largest and the biggest drop in social welfare in our country's history. DFCR is one of the politicians that is most characterized by abuse of power, influence peddling and enrichment at the public's expense and property of the nation, based on his pro big monopolies stance (financial, communications, food, construction, transport, etc.), advising the power brokers and litigating in favor of the big drug lords. He is one of the main accomplices and operators of the electoral fraud that has been systematically perpetrated in our country, from the concealment of fraud that prevailed in the 1988 [election of ] Salinas de Gortari as President when they burned ballots, to the 2006 elections of Felipe Calderon Hinojosa. He is one of the main accomplices of the dirty war and counterinsurgency waged by the PRI regime and now by the PAN against social movements, armed or not, making him another of the many accomplices that have left countless politically persecuted, tortured, murdered, imprisoned or disappeared people. He is directly responsible for Mexico becoming subordinate to the block of capitalist countries in our continent, led by the U.S. imperialists, and, by extension, the dismantling of our industry, the death of our rural areas, the mass migration of the poor and the plundering of our natural resources. In short, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos Ramos is an operator of the neoliberal oligarchy and the far right fundamentalists; a power broker, a mercenary of the courts, a legislature for hire, a financier of the crisis and a defender of the great drug lords. Thus his detention was a way for him to say sorry. Taking him prisoner, display him and making him return a thousandth of what he's stolen was also a political blow to the plutocracy and its institutions, a demonstration of the will to fight and operational capacity of the ""underwearless"" as he called us; a demonstration that no one, however powerful, is untouchable; a demonstration of unity of action that can break the will of the enemy and fight impunity. There has seldom been the fear, confusion and anger that the internet image of 'Jefe' Diego generated in the powerful ruling elite, and that the media were forced to divulge. That image did not have the arrogance and cynicism of those who have partied night and day their whole personal and political lives with our earnings, but rather total helplessness, almost like how we Mexicans have been living our whole lives, and one notable difference: Diego was not injured, and [we didn't show] any contempt for human life, which demonstrates our power.

"FARC Entrance to Colombias Political Arena Haunted by Guerrillas Past. Colombia's demobilized FARC guerrilla group recently launched a new political party, but internal divisions have left the future of the new organization uncertain. On September 1, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarios de Colombia - FARC), who signed a historic peace agreement with the Colombian government in 2016, officially debuted their new political party, the Common Alternative Revolutionary Force (Fuerza Alternativa Revolucionaria del Comun - FARC). The party's leadership is composed of 111 members, all of whom were in charge of selecting the party's 15-member National Political Council, the party president and the former guerrillas who will occupy the 10 congressional seats they will be awarded in the Senate and House of Representatives in 2018 as part of the peace agreement. On September 4, the FARC leadership named Rodrigo Londono Echeverri, alias ""Timochenko"" -- the former guerrilla commander-in-chief -- as party president, in addition to appointing Luciano Marin Arango, alias ""Ivan Marquez,"" as the party's political advisor and Jorge Torres Victoria, alias ""Pablo Catatumbo,"" as the organizational advisor. Both of the latter men are former members of the FARC guerrilla group's Secretariat. After his appointment, Timochenko addressed the FARC's rank and file in a September 12 letter , acknowledging some of the difficulties and fractures that are taking place within the party. Among other things, he recognized questions regarding his leadership capabilities, what direction the party will take ideologically and how ongoing problems with the peace process may also affect the party. Timochenko concluded by calling on those who ""do not believe in"" the peace process to ""step aside and let us work."" The FARC's transition to politics has not been smooth , and the road ahead is expected to be equally rocky. As Timochenko has affirmed, the FARC are entering politics with disagreements among the organization's leaders. This may weaken the ability of the new political party to convince former fighters to join the movement. Even during the years of peace negotiations hosted in Havana, Cuba, the FARC's leadership was apparently split along two ideological routes: A more open and less dogmatic faction led by Timochenko, or a more conservative and rigid faction led by Ivan Marquez. On top of this split are the obvious challenges the former guerrillas will face in running a political party for the first time, especially under the questionable leadership of Timochenko, who is apparently facing significant internal opposition. The party's political capital is already being jeopardized by the formation of criminal cells composed of former FARC fighters, lingering questions regarding the total wealth of the former guerrilla organization, and attempts by drug traffickers to pass themselves off as demobilizing FARC members in order to improperly take advantage of judicial benefits under the peace deal. At the same time, the FARC base is having doubts on whether or not the government is going to fulfill the promises it made under the agreement. The former guerrillas are reportedly worried about what productive projects they will be provided, and whether or not they will receive enough land to help them reintegrate into civilian life. This shaky start may further incentivize former guerrillas to abandon the accords, making them more vulnerable to recruitment by criminal actors. Indeed, many of the FARC's members were recruited as youths rather than joining the group organically or for ideological reasons, and may have little interest in joining the political party."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Colombias Largest-Ever Manhunt Hasnt Caught Its Top Target. Heres Why.Colombia's dense jungle on the Caribbean coast is the heartland of the Urabenos, one of the most powerful criminal organizations in the Americas. This is where its top leaders are hiding, and it is also where the government is rebooting its largest-ever police operation to try, once again, to force them out. But so far the massive effort has failed to achieve its main objective: capturing Colombia's most wanted criminal suspect. Flanked by the Panamanian border and the Caribbean Sea, the towering trees and remote cays of Colombia's Uraba region are the perfect natural fortress for the most wanted man in the country, Dairo Antonio Usuga, alias ""Otoniel,"" head of Colombia's most powerful crime group, the Urabenos. More than two years ago, the Colombian government launched what was to become a prolonged hunt for Otoniel and his inner circle: ""Operation Agamemnon,"" led by the police's infamous Search Bloc (Bloque de Busqueda), which was formed in the early 1990s to hunt down Medellin Cartel kingpin Pablo Escobar. Escobar was gunned down on a Medellin rooftop in December 1993, although there are conflicting reports about whether it was actually a police officer who pulled the trigger. But while Operation Agamemnon has far greater numbers of officers, resources and funding than the Medellin Search Bloc, its agents have blundered through the Urabenos heartland without netting any of the group's top leaders, despite hundreds of lower-level arrests. Now, Colombia is calling in the army for ""Agamemnon II."" The essential characteristics of the first iteration of Agamemnon will not change, but will be ""reengineered"" in this just-inaugurated second phase, according to a justice official directly involved in the operation who spoke to InSight Crime on condition of anonymity. However, the most significant change in strategy -- the direct involvement of the army -- may be a largely political move. Politics at Play? According to the government source, there had been a lot of ""jealousy"" within the military regarding the well-funded police operation. Agamemnon initially deployed around 1,200 police agents, supported by Black Hawk helicopters, with occasional collaboration from the army. However, the military argued that the police-led operation would be much stronger if the armed forces could bring their expertise in rural terrain to the table, which they will now do, the source explained. But bringing the army more fully on board is unlikely to break down bureaucratic jockeying within the government's security apparatus. The institutions involved in Agamemnon -- the attorney general's office, the army and different police units -- each have separate investigations into Otoniel and his inner circle. And all of them apparently are in competition, fiercely guarding their intelligence in order to be the first to capture the most wanted man in Colombia. While full collaboration would most likely bring the government closer to pinning down Urabenos leaders like Otoniel, this is a key opportunity for the military to prove that it is indispensable to citizen security. As Colombia moves forward with implementing a peace deal with country's main guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), the army is seeking to carve out a role for itself in this new scenario, including propping up the police's fight against organized crime. Tough Terrain As well as these political stumbling blocks, Agamemnon has faced extreme physical and strategic challenges. The geography of Otoniel's hideout is a huge obstacle. The barely navigable jungle of Uraba is home turf to the Urabenos' leaders, some of whom have an insurgent background and are equipped to handle the rough conditions. For the police, this is more difficult. Just six months into the operation, a helicopter crashed due to bad weather in pursuit of Urabenos boss Luis Orlando Padierna Pena, alias ""Inglaterra,"" killing 17 agents. In some areas, access by air is almost impossible given the tall rainforest canopy, and other locations can only be reached by sea. The Urabenos use these factors to their advantage, but they also have another key asset: the local community. Many residents allegedly protect the criminal bosses, acting as lookouts and informants that assist their permanent protection rings. Collaborators apparently include local indigenous people, whose reserves cannot be bombed nor freely accessed by security forces. Apparently, the police have not even attempted requesting entry to indigenous reserves -- which must be done through the reserve's governor -- as they know that this would immediately tip off their target. Two years of Agamemnon have achieved the following results : 1,284 arrests (1,001 members of the Urabenos) 52 suspects killed in combat 444 operations 94 metric tons of cocaine seized 81 laboratories seized 2 clandestine landing strips destroyed 517 assets seized (valued at $115 million) $9 million more seized 409 weapons seized Source: Colombia National Police The police have therefore sought to get these same communities on their own side. Their outreach and engagement in social programs has been difficult, but it has paid off; civilian informants have helped them get within meters of their objectives. In one case a few months ago, a police sniper narrowly missed Urabenos number-two Roberto Vargas Gutierrez, alias ""Gavilan,"" 500 meters away from them in the municipality of Necocli. Under such pressure, the Urabenos leaders have become increasingly paranoid about security and have given up their lavish lifestyles. They kill any associates that raise their suspicions, they move around constantly, and have started using human couriers rather than phones. How to Win Agamemnon is now twice as old as the Search Bloc was when it took down Pablo Escobar. The hunt for Escobar ate up around 50 million Colombian pesos a month ($17,000 at current value) for a year and two months, while Agamemnon -- now more than two years old -- is rumored to cost almost 90 times that ($1.4 million a month). However, the operation to get Escobar's had something Agamemnon does not and likely will never have: the collaboration of its target's most vicious enemies, which in Escobar's case included the powerful Cali Cartel. That operation also unfolded in the streets of Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city, in stark contrast to Uraba's harsh jungle terrain. Ultimately, though, one key moment facilitated Escobar's downfall: He made a call to his family, which was promptly intercepted. And this lesson has held fast -- the best way to hasten the hunt is to keep a close watch on family members, the judicial official told InSight Crime. The official argued that a successful Operation Agamemnon would ""destroy"" everything around the Urabenos leaders, which includes intercepting and infiltrating people close to them. So far, authorities appear to have followed that strategy, capturing Otoniel's wife and other relatives. But authorities also have to cripple these bosses financially, which does not only mean seizing cocaine but also sweeping up laundered assets, the source said. A new section of the Attorney General's Office created by the recent peace accords will apparently have a specific unit for this purpose. On the ground, the army may prove to be a valuable asset to anti-Urabenos operations. But even so, their deepened involvement may increase the likelihood of human rights abuses. Agamemnon has admittedly put pressure on the crime group, wh ich according to intelligence officials has be en forced to shift its trafficking operations further towards the Pacific, altering international drug routes in the process. Should the government be successful in bringing down the Urabenos' top bosses, they would take down decades worth of drug trafficking know-how with important international connections. Despite this, there are few signs that the Urabenos organization is buckling. Since 2009, thousands of its members have been captured by authorities , yet it seems that at least as many have been recruited. Indeed, the organization appears to be in expansion mode , seeking to take over territory once controlled by the now demobilizing FARC, which signed a peace agreement with the government last year."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Venezuela Coastal State Could Be Hot New Drug Trafficking Route. Venezuelan authorities seized six major drug shipments during the month of November in the eastern state of Anzoategui, potentially indicating an increase in drug flow through the coastal area due to gangs seeking alternate routes to export substances coming from Colombia. On November 25, agents seized 1,020 kilograms of cocaine and arrested five people, including three Colombians. ""927 packages were transported in a truck, from the city of Machiques in the state of Zulia to the Caribbean islands, with their final destination being the United States,"" said official Jhonny Salazar, according to a statement from the National Anti-Drug Office, as reported by the newspaper Panorama. Four days prior, the Anzoategui state police reported the seizure of 236 packages of marijuana, hidden in a passenger bus traveling between Caracas and Carupano, in the state of Sucre. The three staff on board the vehicle were arrested. The third seizure of 839 packages of marijuana and 62 of cocaine was made on November 10, also in Anzoategui. The Bolivarian National Guard (Guardia Nacional Boliviariana -- GNB) detained two men, including a retired army sergeant, transporting the drugs in the Moja Casabe area of the municipality of Miranda. SEE ALSO : Venezuela Institutional Weaknesses Facilitating Cocaine Trafficking: Report In mid-November, Admiral William Serantes Pinto, commander of the Eastern Integral Defense Strategic Region (Redior), which covers Anzoategui, reported a fourth seizure and that three blows were dealt to drug trafficking efforts in less than ten days. He added that more than two tons of drugs had been seized in the state in 2018 so far. Additionally, police sources revealed to InSight Crime that during November 2018, at least one more ton of drugs had passed through Anzoategui in two other drug trafficking operations, which the authorities were unable to prevent. The coastal nature of Anzoategui state is likely to have caught the interest of drug trafficking organizations, which may be searching for new routes to ship out the large quantities of drugs being produced in Colombia and sent to Venezuela. In this context, the director of the National Anti-Drug Office, Jose Grillo, reported that seizures in Anzoategui have increased 67 percent in 2018 compared to 2017. Furthermore, anti-narcotics authorities are all too aware that not all drugs passing through the state of Anzoategui and through eastern Venezuela, in general, are being seized. A police official told InSight Crime that traffickers also favor using the state's roads due to the lack of surveillance in some rural areas. On the other hand, these seizures also coincide with the discovery of clandestine airstrips in November in a rural area of Guarico state (bordering Anzoategui and Apure) and the seizure of two aircraft. This suggests a network that includes air connections air, with the aim of sending drugs from Colombia to Caribbean islands and on to the rest of the globe, including Honduras and Mexico, as authorities have specified. Sources within the scientific police consulted by InSight Crime also revealed an investigation into GNB officials aiding drug trafficking operations in Anzoategui. Evidence points to certain controls being avoided on key shipments, or bribes being paid to soldiers for routes to be cleared for drug transports. Finally, it should be remembered that Anzoategui is one of the states where the presence of the National Liberation Army (Ejercito Nacional de Liberacion - ELN) of Colombia has recently been detected.

"US Blacklists Chapo Guzmans Sons. The United States has imposed sanctions against two sons of Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman in the latest effort to clamp down on the drug cartel - but Mexican authorities claim that there are no investigations on the Guzman brothers. The US Treasury Department announced on Tuesday that it would freeze any US assets held by Ivan Archivaldo Guzman Salazar or Ovidio Guzman Lopez and prohibit Americans from conducting business with them under the Foreign Narcotic Kingpin Designation Act. Adam Szubin, director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control said that the US ""will aggressively target those individuals who facilitate Chapo Guzman's drug trafficking operations, including family members."" The US also blacklisted Noel Salgueiro Nevarez , alias ""El Flaco,"" and Ovidio Limon Sanchez , two other high-ranking Sinaloa figures who were detained in Mexico last year and remain in custody there. Following the recent indictment of El Chapo and his associate Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias "" El Mayo ,"" the sanctions brought against the sons of the most wanted man in Mexico are yet another effort by the US to put pressure on the powerful Sinaloa Cartel. But contrary to the US Treasury, authorities with Mexico's Attorney General stated that there are no open organized crime investigations against the Guzman brothers in their country. The Treasury Department noted that Ovidio Guzman has an important role in El Chapo's drug trafficking business, and that his brother Ivan was arrested in Mexico in 2005 on money laundering charges, and later released. El Universal reports that Ivan Guzman Salazar had been accused for making large deposits in two bank accounts and acquiring a BMW, without proof that the money or vehicle were legally obtained. However, Guzman Salazar was released when a magistrate claimed that the financial resources in question were indeed legal, and his relation to the Sinaloa head was inadequate reason to assume that he was involved in drug trafficking operations. The overturning of the sentence could represent El Chapo's influence in the country's judicial system, but it is also possible that Ivan Guzman may simply be uninvolved in the cartel's operations. Either way, while blacklisting the Sinaloa head's family members does signal the US administration's resolution to bring the organization down, it may not have the intended impact unless Ivan and Ovidio Guzman are actually investigated and charged by Mexican authorities, or the US requests their extradition.

"Human Rights Watch Praises, Criticizes Rio Govt. Washington DC-based Human Rights Watch has praised Rio de Janeiro's favela pacification scheme for cutting violence and potentially reducing abuse by police, but it also said that the state must do more to investigate extrajudicial killings by its security officers. In an open letter addressed to Rio de Janeiro state Governor Sergio Cabral, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the Pacifying Police Units (UPPs) were an innovative policy. The UPP units are meant to be composed of elite officers, trained in community policing techniques, working with local people to win their trust in the state. It added that these units, sent to assert state presence in areas controlled by drug traffickers and militias, had the potential to promote more effective policing and reduce abuse, and that they seemed to have cut violence in the areas where they operate. The non-governmental watchdog group noted that there was significant drop in killings by police last year, from 855 cases in 2010 down to 524 in 2011. It attributed this drop in part to the System of Goals and Results Tracking, a scheme that gives bonuses to officers in districts that meet crime reduction targets. One of the things measured is homicide, including killings by police, giving officers an extra incentive not to kill, said HRW. However, the letter added that, while there had been a drop in killings by police, not enough had been done to stop impunity for human rights abuse, internal cover-ups, and deficient investigations. The letter documents several cases in the last two years in which police killed or wounded civilians, and misreported events around the case, claiming, for example, that a victim had been hit in a shootout, when no such confrontation took place. HRW's praise for the scheme as helping to cut abuse by the police is a good indication that the UPP strategy is working. The letter does note that there have been allegations of excessive force on the part of the pacifying units, as well as cases where they have been accused of corruption. However, the fact that this has resulted in action against officers is a sign of strength. As HRW points out, the UPPs seem to have been effective at cutting crime. According to Rio Real , the murder rate has dropped from 40 per 100,000 before the scheme began to 24 per 100,000. A study published in November found that homicides had dropped by half in 17 ""pacified"" favelas. The letter also touches on one of the most persistent criticisms of the program -- that it only covers limited, strategic areas of the city, particularly those close to Olympic and World Cup sites, leaving other crime-ridden areas untouched. Twenty-three UPP units have been installed in Rio since the scheme's inauguration in 2008, and there are plans to have at least 40 by 2014. But according to HRW, the 23 units cover only around 100 of Rio's more than 1,000 low-income communities. Still, as InSight Crime has noted , the fact that the scheme is being criticised for focusing on priority areas is itself a sign of the very high expectations it has raised. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Assessing El Salvadors Gangs in a Post-Truce Context. Violence in El Salvador has skyrocketed during 2015. Although it is unclear to just what extent they are responsible for the bloodshed, an undeniable driver of this violence has been the country's two main street gangs: the MS13 and Barrio 18. This analysis seeks to understand El Salvador's security dynamics following the breakdown of a 2012 gang truce, and if the MS13 and Barrio 18 are evolving into more sophisticated entities. Violence Peaks During 2015, violence in El Salvador surged to critical levels, and began to accelerate in January when MS13 and Barrio 18 gang leaders were transferred back to maximum-security prisons. 1 In February, Ricardo Salvador Martinez -- head of police internal affairs -- declared that ""we're at war"" with the gangs. 2 March then set a record as the most violent month since the end of El Salvador's Civil War in 1992, with 481 murders -- only to be surpassed by May (622 murders), June (677), and then August (907) as the bloodiest month of the past two decades. 3 This is an excerpt from a paper originally published in the Georgetown Security Studies Review. It was presented by the author at the Georgetown University Center for Security Studies' symposium entitled, ""The Changing Calculus of Security and Violence."" See the full PDF version of the paper here. Driving the spike in violence has been the MS13 and Barrio 18, whose leaders are demanding the government revive the 2012 truce and curtail anti-gang legislation and security efforts. 4 Gang-driven violence and threats have thus been viewed as a means of pressuring the government into negotiations. For instance, in late July there was a gang-enforced transportation ""boycott,"" when gang members (believed to be from the Barrio 18's Revolucionarios faction) ordered bus drivers to go on strike or else suffer the consequences. 5 Attacks against security forces have also increased, with gang members allegedly attacking security personnel over 250 times in 2015 through May -- an average of two confrontations per day. 6 Police intelligence reports in April asserted the MS13 ordered cliques in the province of La Libertad to kill two police officers each, and that the MS13 and Barrio 18 were planning a combined offensive against the government. 7 In June, police officers discovered a stolen car that had been booby-trapped with a grenade, an apparent attempt at killing police (members of the MS13 were the suspected culprits). 8 Then, in August, Salvadoran authorities announced the MS13 and Barrio 18 were discussing a potential merger to form a unified gang structure and focus their aggression on state security forces. 9 In response to increasing violence, the Salvadoran government has been ratcheting up security measures and hardening its rhetoric towards the gangs. In response to increasing violence, the Salvadoran government has been ratcheting up security measures and hardening its rhetoric towards the gangs. For instance, in January 2015 the director of the National Civil Police (PNC) said police should use their weapons against criminals ""with complete confidence."" 10 President Salvador Sanchez Ceren then announced in May three battalions of Special Forces soldiers would be deployed to combat the gangs. 11 Salvadoran judicial officials have also invoked the country's anti-terrorism laws to prosecute gang members, and in August the Supreme Court declared the MS13 and Barrio 18 to be terrorist groups. 12 Accordingly, the experience of the gang truce, and the nature of gang-directed violence in its wake, raises the question as to how current conditions in El Salvador are to be interpreted. Namely, is the truce, and the gangs' continued violent outbursts, indicative of the gangs' collective evolution into more sophisticated actors? Or, is rising violence more an attempt at self-preservation by gang factions in the face of intensified pressure from rivals and security forces? In an effort to reach an answer, the concept of ""Third Generation Gangs"" will be examined, exploring if its precepts hold sufficient explanatory power for understanding El Salvador's gangs in the context of recent developments in the country. Third Generation Gangs Originally put forward by John P. Sullivan in the 1990s, the field of third generation gang studies seeks to understand the gang phenomenon and characteristics of contemporary criminal street gangs. 13 It has since become one of the primary models for explaining gang behavior and development. The basic tenet is that some gangs evolve through three generations, transitioning from a traditional turf gang to a market-oriented drug gang, before becoming a third generation gang that mixes political and mercenary elements. 14 Three factors are identified as determining the evolutionary potential of gangs: politicization, internationalization, and sophistication. What follows is a brief description of the characteristics defining each gang generation. First Generation First Generation gangs are localized and relatively unsophisticated. 15 They operate under loose leadership, with ill-defined roles and a focus on loyalty and turf protection (neighborhood or street). When they engage in criminal enterprise, it is largely opportunistic and individual in scope, and tends to be local in nature. First generation gangs operate at the low end of societal violence, and primarily engage in inter-gang rivalry. 16 They are limited in political scope. Second Generation Second generation gangs are more entrepreneurial and drug-centered, and are organized for business and commercial gain. As such, they are more interested in market than turf protection, tending to focus their criminal endeavors on local drug distribution as a business. 17 These gangs are also more cohesive, with greater centralization of leadership. They may embrace a broader political agenda -- albeit focused on improving market share and revenue -- and operate in a broader, sometimes multi-national context. 18 Violence is typically a means to control competition, but may also be used as political interference to negate enforcement efforts directed against them by police and other security organizations. As they seek to control or incapacitate state security organizations, they may begin to dominate vulnerable communities. 19 Third Generation A third generation gang is a mercenary-type group with goals of power or financial acquisition. As they evolve, they develop into more sophisticated organizations with broader drug-related markets -- operating at the global end of the spectrum -- with ambitious political and economic agendas. Political action is intended to provide security and freedom of movement for gang activities, although quasi-terrorism or true terrorism may be embraced to advance influence and objectives. 20 As a consequence, a third generation gang challenges the legitimate state monopoly on the use of violence within a given political territory. 21 Typically, third generation gangs are the result of gangs maturing due to exposure to more sophisticated criminal enterprises, combined with access to an opportunity space conducive to enhanced sophistication and expanded reach. 22 In short, third generation gangs are in a state of transition from street gang to sophisticated, networked criminal enterprises. They may, however, continue first and second generation actions as they expand their geographical presence and seek to further their commercial and political goals. 23 *** To determine if El Salvador's MS13 and Barrio 18 gangs are evolving into more sophisticated, internationalized, and politicized entities -- transitioning from their first generation origins into full-blown third generation gangs -- the effects of the truce on the gangs will be examined. Overall, while there are some signs the truce may have resulted in a reconfiguration of the gangs' self-perception as political entities, there are reasons to believe the gangs' post-truce behavior does not represent their collective maturation into third generation gangs, suggesting instead that the increase in violence is more indicative of autonomous manifestations of rebellion and self-preservation by gang factions. The Post-Truce Context: Collective Maturation or Self-Preservation? A persistent concern surrounding the gang truce is that it allowed the MS13 and Barrio 18 to become more sophisticated. Namely, there have been some indications the truce strengthened gang hierarchy by forcing the leadership to exert greater control in order to ensure the truce was respected. Indeed, the significant drop in homicides following the truce's implementation would suggest a certain degree of command and control on the part of gang leaders over members -- although the increase in disappearances during the truce does call this into question. A factor possibly enabling the gangs to become more powerful and organized during the truce was that MS13 and Barrio 18 leaders were transferred to less restrictive prisons with greater access to the outside world. 24 Isolated signs of the gangs' possible evolution are offset by other occurrences suggesting otherwise, which indicate the MS13 and Barrio 18 are not undergoing a collective maturation process. Increasing gang organization may in turn have fostered more transnational cooperation and coordination. Even during the truce, there was evidence of imprisoned leaders in El Salvador coordinating with members in the United States. 25 There have also been some indications that the MS13 sought to establish a presence in Europe and South America, allegedly attempting to have members deported to countries where the gang was hoping to expand (although the extent of this to date appears limited). 26 There were also suggestions the gangs (particularly the MS13) used the truce to become more integrated into the structures of regional transnational criminal organizations, solidifying ties to transportista (drug transit) networks and establishing connections with Mexican cartels. 27 Notably, in October 2012, seven months after the truce began, the United States placed the MS13 on a list of transnational drug trafficking organizations -- alongside powerful groups like Mexico's Zetas -- and later put economic sanctions on six MS13 leaders. 28 In July 2013, Salvadoran Security Minister Ricardo Perdomo said that, over the course of the truce, ""there are groups that have increased their drug trafficking activities,""and in June 2014, Alejandro Vila -- a special prosecutor for the migrant unit in Chiapas, Mexico -- said the MS13 was deepening its hold on illegal migration routes in Mexico. 29 Additionally, the gangs' behavior during the truce suggests a degree of political identity and self-awareness. For instance, the rhetoric of the gangs took on a distinct political quality, with a number of press releases issued exhibiting a diplomatic tone and formality. 30 This -- combined with images of gang leaders holding discussions and negotiations with official intermediaries, in essence a de facto recognition by the government of the gangs as political actors -- indicates (or gives the impression) of a new level of political awareness. Indeed, it is possible MS13 and Barrio 18 leaders began to understand that territorial control and cohesion made it possible for them to extract concessions from the state. 31 For example, the gangs have declared they have the power to influence elections. These statements were backed up by truce mediator Raul Mijango, who in October 2013 stated representatives of at least two of El Salvador's top political parties had met with Barrio 18 and MS13 leaders, adding that the gangs are ""an elector that can define the result"" of presidential elections. 32 In February 2014, Barrio 18 and MS13 leaders issued a statement claiming the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) political party almost lost the 2014 elections because it did not have the gangs' backing. 33 Douglas Farah has explained the possibility of the gangs becoming increasingly active in politics, not as political parties, but essentially as ""votes for rent,"" whereby the gangs deliver votes from areas under their control in exchange for political favors. 34 Nonetheless, these isolated signs of the gangs' possible evolution are offset by other occurrences suggesting otherwise, which indicate the MS13 and Barrio 18 are not undergoing a collective maturation process. The cohesion of the MS13 and Barrio 18 should not be overestimated. While the MS13 and Barrio 18 obviously have a transnational presence -- and, to a degree, can link their international network to conduct cross-border crimes -- there is little evidence they operate as transnational criminal organizations. And despite the effects of the truce, it remains that the gangs are large, fundamentally loose-knit networks, and are better understood as a franchise of affiliated cliques than as coherent third generation gang entities. For instance, during the truce, certain cliques and factions were difficult to control, being either uncooperative or unwilling to abide by the truce. 35 There was also evidence of tensions between the gangs' top leadership -- who drove the truce process -- and rank and file members. The cliques were largely excluded from the truce process, and there were rumblings of discontent among certain cliques that perceived gang leaders as disproportionally benefitting from the truce. 36 There have been other signs of disagreement and turmoil within the gangs as well. In August 2015, 14 members of the Barrio 18's Revolucionarios faction were murdered at the Quezaltepeque prison. While the motive is unknown, authorities believed the killings were part of an ""internal purge"" within the Barrio 18. Indeed, there have been reports that rising violence in 2015 is due to intra-gang competition, with Salvadoran Security and Justice Minister Benito Lara attributing high homicide levels in August to ""an internal rivalry between gangs and confrontations by criminals against the police."" 37 During and following the truce, the MS13 and Barrio 18 did not demonstrate a developed political agenda. Nor has violence and gang members' participation in more sophisticated -- or transnational -- criminal activities since the truce been a collective advancement. For instance, it was the Barrio 18's Revolucionarios faction that allegedly enforced the gang-ordered transportation strike in July. 38 Similarly, in June 2015 there were indications the gangs were involved in an arms trafficking network that smuggled weapons into El Salvador from Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Yet the network only involved 16 of the MS13's roughly 250 cliques, and of the 90 suspects arrested in connection to the case only 21 were MS13 members. It appears these MS13 members were primarily involved in buying and distributing guns within El Salvador, not coordinating the transnational sale of weapons themselves. 39 Additionally, during and following the truce, the MS13 and Barrio 18 did not demonstrate a developed political agenda or coherent political action. Instead, violence appears to be more a reaction to the transfer of gang leaders back to maximum-security prisons, and a natural response in self-preservation against the government's increasingly hard-line anti-gang stance -- and perhaps against internal gang rivals as well -- than an attempt to advance a significant political transformation. Consequently, the truce, and rising violence in its wake, has not given way to the collective maturation of the MS13 and Barrio 18 into third generation gangs. Rather, violence appears to be more indicative of intra-gang rivalries and autonomous attempts at self-preservation during the ongoing fallout of the failed truce. Nonetheless, this does not mean certain segments of the gangs are not demonstrating the potential for evolving into more sophisticated actors. Instead, the third generation gang paradigm may offer only limited explanatory power to understanding El Salvador's gangs in a post-truce context, calling for a reconfiguration in how the gangs are assessed. Third Generation Gangs: Assessing the Paradigm Third generation gang studies offers a useful guide for broadly understanding and characterizing the different stages of gang evolution in a variety of different contexts. Yet the paradigm is deficient in several respects, especially its lack of interpretation into how gang structure affects evolution processes and outcomes. That is, the paradigm offers little guidance for understanding internal gang dynamics and behavior, and the factors that may promote or lessen a gang's movement towards increasing politicization, internationalization, and sophistication -- beyond simply having an opportunity space afforded by weak institutions or exposure to more sophisticated criminal organizations. Perhaps it is incorrect to ask if the MS13 and Barrio 18 are experiencing a collective maturation, and instead ask what elements of the gangs are evolving, and why. In the context of El Salvador, it is inappropriate to think of the MS13 and Barrio 18 as monolithic organizations. Instead, we should try to understand them as franchised, disperse networks consisting of numerous cliques and factions. As such, perhaps it is incorrect to ask if the MS13 and Barrio 18 are experiencing a collective maturation, and instead ask what elements of the gangs are evolving, and why. More specifically, while the truce may not be a sign of the collective evolution of the gangs, it may be a sign of the evolution of certain segments of the gang structure. For instance, it was imprisoned MS13 and Barrio 18 leaders that formulated, implemented, and oversaw the truce. Nonetheless, gang leaders had trouble keeping the cliques and violence in check as the truce unraveled -- even though they reaffirmed the gangs' commitment to the truce on multiple occasions -- with some cliques expressing contempt for the truce and the lack of benefits it brought them. 40 This leads to speculation that the gangs' hierarchy is being stretched, with opposite ends of the gang structure moving in different directions given competing interests and agendas. The gangs' older imprisoned leadership, for example, may be attempting to become more sophisticated political actors, negotiating with the government, while younger members on the street are more prone to violence, recklessness, and opportunistic crime -- perhaps an indication of a generational split within the gangs. Or, it may be that, given the large membership of the Barrio 18 and MS13 and the territorial expanse of their networks, a separation within the ranks is inevitable, with gang factions that have competing agendas beginning to diverge from one another. Refining the Paradigm This leads to the need to incorporate new elements into the third generation gang paradigm to expand both its predictive and explanatory power. Greater tools are needed for assessing how, when, and if a gang -- or elements of a gang -- is evolving into a more sophisticated entity. This entails several areas in need of further study and development to assess their relevance in determining a gang's evolutionary potential, as well as their potential inclusion into the third generation gang paradigm in order to enhance its ability to present a more refined understanding of gang evolution. Pulling from the current case regarding El Salvador's MS13 and Barrio 18 gangs, there are several areas where inquiry should begin. First, we can look at the effects of gang membership: are larger gangs more prone to evolve into third generation gangs than smaller gangs? Or is there a threshold where a gang becomes so large it fractures, with some gang elements evolving while others do not? Second, related to this are questions over what holds a gang structure or network together, be it incentives of loyalty, financial, or fear. Additionally, what role does the age of a gang play? This pertains not only to a gang's age from the time of its formation, but also the age of key leaders. It is possible that older, seasoned leaders become more strategic and sophisticated over time, and seek to make the gang more internationalized, politicized, and sophisticated, having the connections from a lifetime of criminal activity to do so. In contrast, younger, less-educated gang members are more prone to excessive acts of violence and localized opportunistic crime. Moreover, we need to consider how incarceration impacts gang development. For instance, the prison system has played a key role in the ability of the MS13 and Barrio 18 to organize and consolidate, serving as a ""safe haven"" from which to direct and conduct criminal activities. 41 It may be prisons are an important, if not crucial factor allowing gangs to evolve into more sophisticated entities (and providing them with the necessary contacts to do so). Tied in with this is the role government security strategies play in driving gang maturation, as evidenced by El Salvador's Mano Dura policies encouraging the adaptation of gang members to avoid detection. Further exploring these questions and incorporating their findings into third generation theory may serve to better understand and predict gang evolution, and therefore aid policymakers and security officials in formulating strategy and efforts to prevent gangs from transitioning into more powerful and menacing entities.

The natural resources of South and Central America make rich pickings for savvy criminals with the right contacts. The rainforests of the Amazon and Central America contain a wealth of valuable timber, while the region's array of exotic wildlife supplies goods for both local markets and wealthy foreign collectors. According to a recent report on environmental crime by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime ( pdf ), the illegal timber trade alone brings in estimated annual profits of $100 billion, while the global wildlife trade is worth an estimated $19 billion annually, with approximately 350 million plants and animals sold on the black market every year. This is the first part of a two part series on eco-trafficking in Latin America. See part two here. The profits on offer have seen eco-trafficking emerge as one of the most lucrative forms of organized crime, both in Latin America and around the world. ""Sometimes it is known as an emerging crime, but for us, wildlife and timber crime is no longer emerging,"" Jorge Rios, head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's (UNODC) new Global Programme for Combating Wildlife and Forest Crime (GP), told InSight Crime. ""It falls into the same category as drug trafficking, arms trafficking and human trafficking because it is clear from the patterns of transit and seizures and the amount of resources that are involved, that it is transnational organized crime."" Big Profits, Big Crime Networks Compared to the criminal poster boys of the drug cartels, little is known about the networks behind eco-trafficking, but the UNODC is convinced many of them maintain a broad portfolio of criminal activities. ""These are organized criminal networks that also deal with drugs and other illicit commodities -- they're as good as anyone else, they diversify,"" said Rios. The Global Initiative report breaks down the eco-trafficking chain into three links; source, transit, and destination. The first group involved is the bottom of the chain, those that fell the trees and hunt the animals. The second is the smugglers that move the product, either illicitly or by turning it into a legal product through fraud or by manufacturing. The last is the vendors, collectors, consumers and businesses that sell or use the final product, and the criminal ""controllers"" that oversee the whole chain. According to Bernardo Ortiz, head of the South America office of wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic, it is at the second stage that eco-trafficking commonly intersects with established organized crime groups. ""You have the people who have invested money in buying and putting all these things together and then you start seeing how the experts on illegality start facilitating the flow of these commodities through controls,"" he told InSight Crime. ""These are the same guys who know how to bring any illegal stuff through these corridors."" In Colombia, where organized crime's roots run deep, the overlap between eco-trafficking and the trafficking of drugs, arms, cash and people is substantial, according to Ortiz. But even in countries with less developed trafficking networks, the two will likely interact. ""Once you get into dirty business, you are always going to end up bumping into those that control whatever illegal activities,"" he said. In Colombia and Peru, eco-trafficking is also linked to illegal armed groups. In Colombia, guerrilla and narco-paramilitary groups charge ""taxes"" on any illicit shipments passing through the remote territories they control, while in Peru, the Shining Path guerrillas also profit from the illegal logging trade, according to the authorities. In other areas, organized crime groups dedicated to eco-trafficking -- in particular the timber trade -- appear to have evolved. In Nicaragua, communities and the authorities have complained of a growing ""wood mafia"" and the presence of Honduran armed groups seeking to profit from timber illegally logged in remote border regions. However, in the country that has seen the most violence around eco-trafficking -- Brazil -- it is lawlessness and impunity rather than organized crime that is driving the killing. A recent investigation by Global Witness revealed at least 448 environmental and land activists were murdered between 2002 and 2013, the majority of the killings linked to logging. While only 1 percent of cases resulted in a conviction, according to Global Witness, loggers and landowners rather than armed groups are widely believed to be behind the murders. Market Diversity for Biodiversity Timber and wildlife trafficking in Latin America serve both the high volume, low price domestic market, and the low volume but sky-high price of foreign export markets. But the routes to market are very different. Wildlife trafficking for the domestic market commonly involves the sale of restricted products, such as the turtles and iguanas traditionally devoured over Lent in Colombia, or crocodile meat destined for the insatiable market in northern Brazil. Illegal timber is also easily disposed of in the local market, waved through by corrupt officials and snapped up by construction companies that pay scant attention to the forged paperwork, according to Ortiz's investigations with Traffic. However, as in the drug trade, while national markets make quick and easy profits, the big money is made abroad. For wildlife traffickers, that means either smuggling animals and plants out of the country, or laundering them into a ""legal"" product before export. Much of the demand is driven by private collectors in the United States and Europe seeking rare plants and animals. It is met by Latin American traders who have contacts in remote regions to source and traffic what the collectors order, and a trusted sales and distribution network. According to Ortiz, these networks commonly conduct their business in both the legal and illegal worlds, and deals are often struck and contacts made on the fringes of gatherings such as trade fairs. ""On the sides of the meeting, in the hotels nearby, you have the collectors selling the stuff you cannot showcase in these fairs,"" he said. After deals have been struck, traffickers commonly move the animals and plants by air using similar methods to those used to send small quantities of drugs. Animals are drugged and stashed in luggage, or strapped to the smuggler, and eggs are carefully hidden about the person. Living contraband is also often hidden among legal wildlife shipments. When the product is no longer alive then there is sometimes the opportunity to merge it with the legal market before it hits customs. One of the most notorious examples of this is the caiman farms of Colombia, which provide skins for luxury clothing items. The farms legally export caiman skins, but they sell far more than they could feasibly produce -- because, according to Ortiz, they illegally source eggs, hatchlings and young caiman from the wild. Trafficking timber abroad requires a similar laundering into the legal market, but demands different skills from smugglers. ""Timber is more difficult because it is harder to hide logs than birds, so it requires more subtle illegality from people who know how to use the system and make use of documents,"" said Ortiz. As a result, traffickers rely on maintaining a network of corrupt officials that will let shipments pass and false documents slide. ""We know that timber crime is basically corruption; false permits, using supposedly legal permits, it's just putting it on a container and paying someone off,"" said Rios. According to Rios, the biggest foreign market for illegal Latin American timber is Asia. Traffickers slip through shipments using falsified permits and bills of landing, received by processing companies that avoid questions about the wood's origins or the legitimacy of the documents that accompany it. ""They know very well,"" he said. ""They have a legal export permit and that's what they use to say 'look, I'm complying with my obligation, here's the permit.' But they don't check the company that sends it to them."" While some of the freshly legalized timber is sold in Asia, much of it is shipped on to the United States, Europe, or even back to Latin America. Despite this array of products, sources and destinations, all eco-trafficking relies on some level of coordination from the classic trinity of illegality; organized crime, corrupt businesses and corrupt officials. Currently in Latin America, all three operate with almost complete impunity. ""It flows as they want, no matter what country you're in,"" said Ortiz. This is the first in a two-part series on eco-trafficking in Latin America. See the second part here ."	0	0	0	1	0	1	0
"A Blast from the Past: The Duque Security Plan for Colombia. When Colombian President Ivan Duque announced his new security plan, he told the media that security ""shouldn't be confused with war."" In his actual plan, however, that distinction seems to be of little importance. The plan, released this month, says the Colombian government will not negotiate ""bilateral ceasefires"" when taking on what it calls Organized Armed Groups (Grupos Armados Organizados - GAO). These groups include guerrillas, like the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional -- ELN); former paramilitaries, like the Urabenos, or Gulf Clan; and vestiges of these groups. The one common factor among them is that they are all involved in drug trafficking and other crimes. Security forces will seek the ""disarticulation"" of these groups to prevent them from being able to form new criminal structures, according to the document called the Politics of Defense and Security ( Politica de Defensa y Seguridad - PDS ). A second principle stated in the plan is the recovery of institutional presence throughout the country. To do this, security forces will be focused on what are described as Strategic Zones of Integral Intervention (Zonas Estrategicas de Intervencion Integral - ZEII). These zones are high in crime and violence, as well as located in poor, remote stretches of the country that are rich in natural resources. The government will also bring social services to these territories, though the plan mostly describes military and police interventions. Citizen security networks, which will ""give support to the armed forces,"" are included in this strategy to retake zones under the control of criminal groups. Rafael Guarin, Duque's security minister, was quick to explain that these citizen networks will merely provide information to authorities, adding that their weapon ""is a cellphone."" More than 800,000 Colombians have already registered with these networks, El Tiempo reported. To combat transnational organized crime, the plan calls for security collaborations with neighboring countries and increased intelligence capabilities, such as satellite technology to control Colombia's borders. Duque's security plan is bellicose, short on details and a rehash of controversial strategies implemented by his predecessors -- notably his political mentor, Alvaro Uribe. Uribe, president from 2002 to 2010 and currently a senator, was the first to designate areas that were the focus of armed forces. Uribe's successor Juan Manuel Santos, president from 2010 to 2018, also went after red zones. Their administrations used funding from Plan Colombia, a two-decade-long $10 billion US assistance program , to combat the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), dubbed a narco-terrorist organization. Plan Colombia provided the military new weapons and improved their intelligence capabilities. The forces made important security gains , restoring military presence in neglected areas of the country and driving out illegal armed groups. But security forces also drew fire for the killing of civilians. In the early 2000s, young men were kidnapped, killed, then dressed in army uniforms and reported as enemy combatants in a scandal known as the false positives. In 2015, prosecutors said that they were investigating cases involving nearly 5,000 false-positive victims. At the same time, Duque's citizen security network harkens back to Uribe's Convivir, citizen security groups launched in the mid-1990s ostensibly to bolster the state's fight against violence and crime. InSight Crime reported in 2015 that these groups went on to become shadow criminal organizations and fronts for the right-wing paramilitary movement. The notorious legacy of the Convivir squads, which were armed with the blessing of the government, is likely the reason Duque's security minister immediately made clear that those involved in the new citizen security network will not be armed, and will merely act as intermediaries with authorities. Yet the quick enlistment of hundreds of thousands of Colombians shows that the idea remains popular. Such a large number of informants could provide authorities with vital information about zones under gang control, as in Medellin's hillside districts where the so-called combos have recently stepped up killings. The plan also acknowledges past shortcomings in protecting natural resources from criminal groups, which are increasingly involved in land trafficking , the clear-cutting of forests to make room for coca-cultivation and illegal gold mining , both of which have devastating effects on the environment. It also says that the government will increase its efforts to protect social and community leaders, who have been killed with chilling regularity in recent years. Other valid priorities in the plan include focusing intelligence resources on Colombia's borders, and increasing security cooperation with neighboring countries. Criminal groups of all stripes -- the ELN, FARC dissidents, and drug traffickers like the Urabenos -- are using Ecuador and Venezuela as staging grounds for Colombian drug shipments, illegal gold mining and other illicit economies, such as contraband cattle and other goods. The Duque plan also attempts to take on Colombia's record-high coca cultivation , increasing its annual goal to 100,000 hectares destroyed. But it concentrates on forced eradication efforts , such as aerial fumigation, seemingly at the expense of the crop substitution program implemented as part of the peace agreement with the FARC. Duque's plan hews so closely to his mentor's vision, which Uribe outlined in a plan in 2003, that El Espectador found similar wording in both documents. Both studiously avoid the phrase ""armed conflict."" Tellingly, Duque's security strategy veers from that of his predecessor Santos in an obvious and glaring way. Santos negotiated a peace deal with the FARC, and he was willing to consider such an accord with the ELN. Duque's plan leaves little doubt that no such negotiations will occur under his watch, by making ""bilateral ceasefires"" illegal and stating that armed groups have only one way out: the total ""dissolution"" of their organizations. Meanwhile, a tenuous peace hangs in the balance as the number of FARC dissidents increases. And the ELN continues to expand its presence , grow its criminal economies, and confront the state head-on. The rebel group's recent car bombing of a Bogota police academy calls back to the worst of Colombia's bloody past -- Pablo Escobar's bombing campaigns and M19 guerrillas storming the Palace of Justice. With peace negotiations called off , the ELN's attacks are only likely to increase. To confront Colombia's current threats, however, what is needed is not a return to the past, but new ideas."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"US Troops Tempted by Fast Money from Migrant Smuggling. The arrest of two US Marines on migrant smuggling charges raises concerns that criminal groups along the US-Mexico border are targeting the country's troops, promising them fast money to take part in smuggling operations. The Marines were arrested on July 3 after Border Patrol agents stopped their vehicle on a California highway near the US-Mexico border. Sitting in the car's back seat were three migrants who had illegally entered the United States, according to a federal criminal complaint obtained by the New York Times. Information gleaned from the two Marines -- who were stationed at Camp Pendleton, just 90 kilometers north of the Mexican border -- subsequently led to the arrest of 18 marines and a sailor at the military base. They are accused of a number of crimes, ranging from migrant smuggling to drug violations, according to the Associated Press (AP). This is not the first case where US military personnel have been involved in migrant smuggling rings. SEE ALSO : Coverage of the US-Mexico Border Last year, four active duty soldiers stationed in Fort Hood, Texas, were convicted for smuggling migrants through a border checkpoint. The migrants were hidden under military equipment. Also in 2018, a National Guardsman in California was caught ferrying Mexican migrants trying to enter the United States illegally near San Diego. Before that, two soldiers pleaded guilty in 2016 to transporting a pair of undocumented migrants in the back of their vehicle across a border checkpoint in Falfurrias, along the Texas-Mexico border. In most cases, the troops were not actively involved in patrolling the US border with Mexico. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which includes the Border Patrol, is the force that secures all US borders, though National Guardsmen and Marines have also been deployed to the US-Mexico border in the past. The recent arrests show that troops and other US authorities along the border make attractive partners for criminal groups involved in migrant smuggling. A US Border Patrol spokesman told the AP that ""smuggling rings have been luring US troops, police officers, Border Patrol agents and others to work for them as drivers."" A military figure driving a truck is less likely to be stopped and interrogated. SEE ALSO : Cartels Reopen Old Migrant Routes Through Arizona, New Mexico The quick money to be made may be difficult for some to resist. One of the Marines charged with human smuggling said that he was offered $1,000 for the migrant pick up, according to the federal complaint. Most of those arrested at Camp Pendleton, a base located on a known migrant smuggling route, were reportedly junior enlisted Marines whose monthly salary typically falls between $2,000 and $3,000 per month. But even this scheme may backfire, as smugglers often promise more money for more rides but never pay out, according to the AP. There are also concerns that US immigration policy is exacerbating the issue. The crackdown on the border by the administration of President Donald Trump has led to a jump in smuggling fees and journeys across riskier terrain for migrants. As a result, criminal groups are likely looking to find any edge they can. The complicity of a US official would be a prized asset."	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
"Guatemala Eradicates $300 Mn Heroin Poppy. Guatemala reported eradicating more than $300 million worth of heroin poppy crops this week in San Marcos province, which borders on Mexico, in an indication of the growing value of this crop to the country's traffickers. Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez said that 2.4 billion quetzales ($308 million) of poppy was destroyed in the municipalities of Tajumulco and Ixchiguan, reports Prensa Libre. The 800 agents involved in the operation, which took place between Monday and Wednesday, also eradicated more than Q80 million ($10 million) of marijuana plants. The minister said that the government had destroyed drug crops worth more than $1.3 billion so far in 2012. The US State Department says that Guatemala is a minor, but growing, producer and exporter of opium poppy, estimating that it has more than 1,000 hectares under cultivation. It is now thought to be the second biggest poppy producer in the region, with Mexico in first place and Colombia in third. Guatemala's eradication of the plant increased more than three-fold over the last few years, up from 489 hectares in 2005 to 1,490 in just the first nine months of 2011. As InSight Crime has pointed out , this rise in eradication is likely a sign that more poppy is being grown, not that the government is getting better at removing it. San Marcos is the location of most of the country's poppy production, and was the stronghold of Juan Alberto Ortiz Lopez, alias "" Juan Chamale ,"" who was known as Guatemala's ""heroin king"" until his arrest in March last year. The poppy is usually shipped to Mexico for processing, using San Marcos' loosely guarded sea ports and land border crossings, before being sent to the United States. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Death Toll Rises in Guatemala With Candidates Murder. A candidate running for city council was killed June 23 in Guatemala, bringing the total of campaign-related attacks this year to 30. City council candidate Rony Rodriguez was killed by unknown gumen Thursday in a town near the El Salvador border. He was running on the ticket of ruling party the National Union for Hope (Unidad Nacional de Esperanza - UNE). His campaign aide, Darwin Mendoza, and Mendoza's 7-year-old son were also reportedly kidnapped, in what appears to have been a coordinated attack against Rodriguez and his associates, reports national newspaper La Prensa. So far this year more than 20 political candidates have been murdered in Guatemala. National and municipal elections are due to take place in September. The last election year, in 2007, saw at least 60 attacks and 40 murders. All major parties were affected, although the party of President Alvaro Colom, UNE, suffered the most attacks. Mayoral candidates have been heavily targeted this year , with two killed in June alone. As a recent report by think-tank the International Crisis Group notes , regional politicians may be more at risk than national candidates when it comes to intimidation by armed groups, who may be seeking political capital in rural, municipal governments, where rule of law is weak. Rodriguez's murder comes as Guatemala is wrapping up an international conference about security issues in Central America. 	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
"Mexico President Trumpets Lower Murder Rates But Problems Persist. A pair of new statistical releases has Mexico celebrating its security improvements, though the depth of the changes remains uncertain. Earlier this summer, Mexico's statistical agency, Inegi, released its final tally of murders in 2013 , finding a figure of 22,732, compared to 26,037 in 2012. Then last week, President Enrique Pena Nieto told a class of graduating naval officers that the murder rate through mid-2014 was 27 percent below the first six months of 2012. ""Although there is more work to do, we are making progress on the commitment I took on before the Mexican people to reduce the violence and recover the tranquility for our population,"" the president told the graduating class. It's not clear what statistical agency the president was using to make his claim since he did not cite a source. Inegi is one of two official homicide counters and only releases its data once a year. The other, the National Public Security System, typically has a lower count than Inegi and releases monthly data. Still, the Inegi statistic represents a significant improvement in the murder rate since the end of the tenure of former president Felipe Calderon. The nearly 23,000 murders last year, which equates to murder rate of 19 per 100,000 residents, dropped 13 percent from 2012 and 16 percent from 2011, the high-water mark of the Calderon era. The rate of 19 is also well below the average of some of Mexico's neighbors in Central and South America. The murder rate of 19 per 100,000 is likewise a significant drop from the worst figure of the Calderon era -- 24 per 100,000 -- and it seems poised to drop further. Mexico's National Public Security System registered 8,101 murders over the first six months of 2014, which puts Mexico on pace for a further 12 percent drop in murders this year compared to last year. All of this serves as evidence that the Pena Nieto's basic bet on security -- reducing both the attention paid to insecurity and the violence itself -- is paying dividends. In addition to the litany of statistics like those mentioned above, the international narrative on Mexico has changed dramatically. Stories of economic liberalization and reform are now as common as tales of beheadings. However, the rosy picture glosses over a number of lingering challenges. First, the declines in murders do not account for killings when the body is not found. The several hundred bodies have been discovered in clandestine graves in Tamaulipas and Durango in recent years demonstrates that hiding the evidence of a murder is a favored tactic of certain criminal groups, and is likely significantly more widespread than is appreciated. Over the first year of Pena Nieto's presidency, the National Registry of Disappeared Persons counted 2,618 missing Mexicans , many of whom may have been murdered. The fact that gangs often have a natural incentive to hide their dead bodies -- the greater the public outcry, the more likely a robust federal intervention will force a given gang to alter its modes of operation -- adds further credence to this theory. Furthermore, Pena Nieto's positive stats ignore the fact that extortion and kidnapping , two violent crimes whose recent upsurge has eroded Mexico's social stability, do not to appear to have dropped. On the contrary, both have continued to rise since Pena Nieto ascended to the presidency in December 2012. The persistently high levels of these crimes perhaps explain why perceptions of security have not improved despite the marked decline in the murder rate. Pena Nieto's Mexico also retains pockets of severe violence, which have resisted the overall positive trend. While there have been some high profile successes -- Juarez and Monterrey being two of the most prominent -- many areas in Mexico remain under the heel of criminal groups. Guerrero, Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Mexico State are all on pace for more than 1,000 murders, with both Guerrero and Sinaloa on pace to roughly triple the national murder rate. Furthermore, while many of the specific rivalries that have driven violence in recent years have subsided, large and aggressive criminal gangs with conflicting interests remains scattered around Mexico. The rapid disappearence of Sinaloa Cartel leaders like Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman also promises a potentially destabilizing reorganization of the nation's most powerful trafficking organization, an event that could cause a spike in violence that reverses recent gains. Such facts open a substantial hole in the happy narrative emanating from Mexico's presidency."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Anti-Gang Op Highlights Puerto Ricos Micro-Trafficking Troubles. Authorities in Puerto Rico are targeting a sophisticated gang accused of supplying the local drug market, in a case that demonstrates how rising cocaine transit through the island could fuel the growth of micro-trafficking and the evolution of local gangs. Following a joint investigation by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Puerto Rican police, arrest warrants were issued for seventy-two individuals charged with drug trafficking in Puerto Rico's capital city of San Juan. So far 44 people have been arrested, reported the Puerto Rico Metro. The gang allegedly distributed cocaine, crack, marijuana, heroin and prescription medications like Percocet and Xanax in San Juan, reported El Nuevo Dia. Prosecutors say they believe the gang earned around $15 million over the last few years. US Attorney for Puerto Rico Rosa Emilia Rodriguez said the gang had been linked to at least six homicides committed between 2007 and 2014. Members have also been accused of participating in drive-by shootings and reportedly possessed high caliber weapons including AK-47s and AR-15s. Authorities have identified six leaders of the organization, some of whom allegedly operate from prison. In recent years, an apparent resurgence of the Caribbean cocaine trafficking route has seen Puerto Rico emerge as an increasingly important transshipment point for cocaine headed to the mainland United States. Part of the island's appeal to drug traffickers is due to its status as a US territory, which means that shipments from Puerto Rico do not have to pass through customs on their way to the mainland. By the end of May this year, over 17 tons of cocaine had been seized in Puerto Rico by a task force comprised of the US Coast Guard and other security forces, compared to under six tons in all of 2011. Although officials estimate that 80 percent of drugs that reach Puerto Rico are shipped on to the mainland United States, the remaining 20 percent are sold on the domestic market. Fighting among local gangs for control of domestic distribution has already led to significant violent conflict, with an estimated 70 to 80 percent of murders linked to drugs, and it is likely more gangs will grow in strength and numbers as transit through Puerto Rico increases. While the recently dismantled drug gang appears to have only distributed locally, other Puerto Rican criminal groups have been involved in sending cocaine shipments from the island to the mainland US. In addition to fueling a growth in micro-trafficking, increased drug transit through Puerto Rico may also facilitate the evolution of domestic gangs by allowing them to form ties with transnational criminal organizations operating on the island.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador Prosecutors Reveal Use of Anti-Gang Law During Truce. Prosecutors in El Salvador have revealed that 180 people were convicted under the country's controversial anti-gang law during ten of the 13 months the gang truce has been in place, highlighting a potential pitfall for the peace deal. In response to a freedom of information request by the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development (FUSADES) for total convictions under the law, which came into force in September 2010, the Attorney General's Office only provided details of convictions between June 2012 and April 2013, reported La Prensa Grafica. Negotiators of the truce between the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 street gangs, which began in March 2012, have previously called for a repeal of the law as part of negotiations. The Gang Prohibition Act doubled the maximum prison sentence for minors, declared gang membership illegal, and gives the authorities permission to freeze bank accounts and seize the assets of gang members. The last Salvadoran Attorney General, Romeo Barahona, had previously gone on record saying prosecutors were not implementing the anti-gang law as they had not been presented with enough evidence to charge arrested gang members. His position reflected that of critics of the law, including truce negotiators former congressman Raul Mijango and Bishop Fabio Colindres, who say police have used the law to round up gang members in mass arrests, but that these arrests rarely result in successful prosecutions. Although it is impossible to compare the number of convictions before and after the truce, due to the limited statistics released, the available numbers raises the possibility that the law may now be being implemented more vigorously than before the government-gang negotiations began. One possible reason for this is the current Attorney General, Luis Martinez, who openly opposes the truce, labelling it ""false and hypocritical. "" If this is the case, then the law has the potential to be a sticking point in future talks, as supporters of the truce call for its repeal, while opponents use it as a tool to increase persecution of gang members."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
WikiLeaks on the Chavez-Correa-FARC connection. According to a new cable released by WikiLeaks via El Espectador, the government of former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe planned to leak compromising material that linked both Venezuelan President Chavez and Ecuadorean President Correa to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ). The cable says that then-defense minister and current President Juan Manuel Santos told then-U.S. Ambassador William Brownfield in 2008 that the government planned to selectively release the information to various international media outlets. The material allegedly came from hard drives that belonged to Luis Edgar Devia, alias 'Raul Reyes,' the FARC's second-in-command. The hard drives were seized after Raul Reyes was killed during a raid in early 2008 by the Colombian security forces on Ecuadorean soil. This incident led to a break in relations between the countries which lasted almost two years. The latest report from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), an initiative set up by the Norwegian Refugee Council ( NRC ) upon the request of the United Nations (UN), states that over 27 million people have become internal refugees worldwide in 2010. Colombia shares first place with Sudan, with some 3.6-5.2 million internally displaced people, due to the complexity of its internal conflict and the issues with organized crime. Mexico , while having relatively low figures compared to the South American country, still registers a bigger number than Afghanistan for 2010. Mexico's Zetas cartel has increased its presence in Central America, according to Excelsior. The criminal group is reportedly moving its drug trafficking operations into the region in the face of harassment in Mexico, both from the legal security forces (U.S. and Mexican authorities) and by the illegal armies of the rival Sinaloa and Gulf Cartels. The Zetas' modus operandi involves taking coca base shipments from Colombia to Honduras and Central America, and processing it there, as exemplified by the Honduras authorities' dismantling of a coca base processing laboratory last week. 	1	1	0	0	0	0	1
Bolivia Turns to Venezuela for Anti-Drug Aid. Bolivia has turned to Venezuela as it continues its search for partners to replace the United States in providing anti-drug aid, in what may prove an unwise choice given that corruption is rife in the Venezuelan security forces. The Bolivian government's first request of its political ally was for helicopters, which will be used to strengthen Bolivia's anti-drug forces by allowing the rapid deployment of troops. According to the country's top anti-drug official Felipe Caceres, aerial support is key for the manual eradication of illegal coca crops, which are often in remote locations with no road access, reported the Prensa Latina. The plea for support comes shortly after the US announced the closure of its anti-drug office in Bolivia , bringing a tempestuous era of anti-narcotics cooperation to a close. The US-Bolivia relationship was highly strained since President Evo Morales threw out the US Drug Enforcement Agency in 2008 after accusing the agency of spying. It is unsurprising that Morales has turned away from US anti-narcotics assistance due to the political tensions between the two countries. However, while Morales may now be free of any political strings attached to that aid, Bolivia will struggle to find a partner that will provide the same levels of funds, technology, and expertise. In recent times, Morales has turned to Brazil , Russia, and even Iran in his search for partners in anti-narcotics operations. However, the decision to increase cooperation with Venezuela is a worrying sign. Venezuela has taken on an increasingly important role in drug trafficking over the last decade. This is partly due to the presence of Colombian narco-paramilitary groups such as the Rastrojos, and guerrilla groups the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). However, the biggest contributing factor has been institutional corruption. From the low-level members of the military that wave through drug shipments along the border, to the Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns) -- a drug trafficking network made up of high-ranking military officials -- the Venezuelan security forces are far from ideal partners in tackling drug trafficking.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"The Routes and Methods of Perus Cocaine Traffickers. In the fourth part of its series on drug trafficking in Peru, IDL-Reporteros looks at the methods used to move some 200 tons of cocaine a year out of the VRAE region, and maps out the routes employed by traffickers. The Apurimac and Ene River Valley (VRAE) is Peru's biggest drug-producing region -- about a third of the country's coca is cultivated there -- and much of its output is transported to Bolivia as less refined cocaine paste for processing. The Shining Path guerrilla group are active there, though the extent of their involvement with the cocaine trade is unclear. This report shows that although they play an important role, they are not the only players in the valley's cocaine business. Instead, the group is employed to protect cocaine shipments on the routes it controls. The trafficking clans of the VRAE hide their shipments in the bodies of trucks, some of which are chosen to blend in with the vehicles of the local mining and construction companies. The following is InSight Crime's translation of extracts from the fourth installment in IDL-Reporteros' series on Peru's drug trade, "" The Cocaine Clans "": A caravan of seven four-door pickup trucks leaves Kimbiri, in Cusco, headed for Desaguadero, in Puno. Hidden in the bodies of the vehicles is about half a ton of washed cocaine paste, which in the valley is worth about $400,000. Some of the drug is hidden in stashes inside the beds of the trucks, and some in the gas tanks, in plastic bottles. Each truck can carry a hidden load of up to 150 kilograms of drugs: 100 in the bed and 50 in the tank. Five of the seven trucks entered Cielo Punku in the morning, after passing through Lobo. Soon after, the drivers had to stop short in a blocked section of the road. Nine anti-drug agents, who were hiding behind a bush, surrounded the trucks and captured the drivers. While they searched the trucks, the two remaining vehicles that had been delayed got past the roadblock before they could be stopped. They were heading to Cusco. The agents followed the vehicles and stopped them in Cusco. It was April of 2010, and the Anti-Drug Squad (Dirandro) seized about half a ton of drugs in this operation. As sources familiar with the issue confirmed to IDL-Reporteros, more than 80 percent of the drugsthat leave the VRAE through Cusco go in pickup trucks, cargo trucks and transport vehicles. Double-cab pickup trucks, especially Toyota Hiluxes, make a good disguise because this is the type of vehicle used by mining and construction companies. Heavy cargo trucks are also in high demand. They transport an average of half a ton of drugs, hidden in stashes in the bed, in sacks or cases of fruits and vegetables, and groceries. Union Mantaro, Llochegua. A group of 20 backpackers or ""cargachos"" prepare their backpacks and supplies. Between them they will carry around 200 kilograms of washed cocaine paste. The ""cargachos"" had been recruited in Puerto Cocos and Puerto Ene, where drug trafficking trade fairs are held on weekends. In greatest supply are precursor chemicals, washed and simple cocaine paste, gasoline, and (one has to eat) groceries. The backpackers are used in the ""ant trafficking"" method, which is one of the most common and secure forms of taking drugs out of the valley. If the ""cargachos"" are ambushed or captured by the police, the loss is not great. But if an important shipment of drugs is going to be transported, more than a half a ton, some traffickers contract the services of the Shining Path's VRAE faction so they can take charge of the transport, using routes they control. As we also saw in the first installment: "" The Shining Path and Drug Trafficking in the VRAE ,"" the Quispe Palomino brothers charge between $50 and $60 per kilo, whether it is cocaine paste or hydrochloride. At four in the morning, while the ""cargachos"" were sleeping in two large rooms in a house in the center of Union Mantaro, a group of 30 police officers entered in silence and suprised them before they could wake up. They were caught in their underwear, with backpacks of cocaine close at hand. As often happens, the people of Union Mantaro tried to stop the arrest, but ultimately they could not do so. Since the operation, in 2008, there has not been any other such large capture of backpackers. The fact that a detention of such magnitude has not been repeated indicates the limitations of interdiction operations in the VRAE. But the methods are changing. According to well-placed sources, the shipment of drugs by cargachos has been reduced significantly, while the smuggling of drugs hidden in vehicles has increased in the valley. Through these routes -- in backpacks and stashes in the bodies of vehicles -- around 200 tons of cocaine is exported from the VRAE each year, the majority washed cocaine paste, and a smaller proportion cocaine hydrochloride. [See IDL-Reporteros' maps of the land and river routes for trafficking drugs out of the VRAE, below.] When it starts its journey to the consumer markets, cocaine in the VRAE (using quantities and prices from 2010) is worth about $200 million. This is a small sum compared to what the same amount of drugs, partially adulterated, would cost at its destination. But it is sufficient to mobilize the energies and the cunning of thousands of people who work in the drug trafficking chain in the VRAE, and to disrupt lives and corrupt people and institutions in the valley.

"Drug Flights Down by 99% in Colombia. The number of drug flights detected in Colombia has dropped by 99 percent in the last decade, indicating that the country's intensive aerial interdiction program has paid off, while air trafficking flourishes in the two other cocaine producers, Peru and Bolivia. Authorities in Colombia have identified just six drug flights moving through the country's air space so far in 2014, compared to 700 detected in 2004, reported RCN. The Colombian Air Force press office confirmed these figures to InSight Crime. According to RCN, authorities attributed the reduction in drug flights to increased aerial surveillance within the country, as well as to aerial interdiction agreements with other countries in the region. Meanwhile, river and sea routes have become the principal way Colombian traffickers move drugs out of the country, reported RCN. The dramatic reduction in drug flights from Colombia points to an unfavorable environment for traffickers to move drugs by air -- a method traffickers prefer when possible because it is cheaper and less risky than land or water transport. This stands in stark contrast to the 1980s, when the Medellin Cartel smuggled massive quantities of cocaine out of Colombia by air to the Caribbean, and on to the United States. The use of radars to detect drug planes has been coupled with a shoot-down policy for planes suspected of drug smuggling. Colombia has also signed agreements with other countries in the region, like Panama and Honduras, to combat aerial drug trafficking. The region's two other primary cocaine producers -- Peru and Bolivia -- have been slow to adopt radar technology, and this has helped facilitate the emergence of an air bridge used to traffic at least 200 tons of coca base from Peru to Bolivia each year. A lack of radar technology has also been a problem for other regional drug hubs like Honduras and Paraguay. While Colombia's aerial interdiction program has been a success within the country, there is evidence that it has helped push aerial drug trafficking operations to Venezuela -- a ""cockroach effect"" of the sort commonly seen in the drug trade, in which the problem is displaced rather than resolved. Furthermore, Colombia could be underestimating its continued air traffic: in 2012, Guatemala's interior minister said that more than 70 drug planes of Colombian origin entered the country each year."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Are the Urabenos Expanding Their Presence in Eastern Colombia?One of Colombia's most powerful criminal organizations could be moving into new territory in the eastern part of the country in an attempt to fill the vacuum left by the death of a top regional crime boss. An army general told El Tiempo that the September 2015 death of Martin Farfan Diaz Gonzalez, alias "" Pijarbey ,"" has led to a ""reconfiguration"" of the criminal landscape in Colombia's Eastern Plains region, which includes the departments of Meta and Vichada. Until his recent killing during a police raid, Pijarbey headed the dominant regional drug trafficking organization, known as the Libertadores del Vichada. Several weeks after Pijarbey's demise, police captured Dario Andres Leon Humanez, alias ""Jonathan,"" the leader of the Libertadores' main local rival, the Meta Bloc. Now, military intelligence sources say that for several months they have detected the presence of members of the Urabenos, also known as ""Clan Usuga,"" in the department of Meta. The Urabenos are believed to maintain an alliance with the Libertadores del Vichada. The sources consulted by El Tiempo said Urabenos leader Dairo Antonio Usuga, alias ""Otoniel,"" instructed his regional lieutenant, alias ""Monar,"" to consolidate the group's position in the eastern region in order to take advantage of potential revenues from extorting the local agricultural industry. Although it is difficult to draw solid conclusions from this preliminary information, it would be little surprise if the Urabenos attempt to establish a greater presence in the Eastern Plains region. In addition to potential extortion revenues from the agricultural sector, the area also has the attraction of being a hub for cocaine production and transshipment to nearby Venezuela and Brazil. The cocaine business in Colombia's Eastern Plains used to be dominated by a right-wing paramilitary group known as the Popular Revolutionary Anti-Terrorist Army of Colombia (Ejercito Revolucionario Popular Antiterrorista Colombiano - ERPAC ), which morphed into a drug trafficking organization in the mid-2000s. After partially demobilizing in 2011, the ERPAC split into the two factions mentioned above -- the Meta Bloc and the Libertadores del Vichada, both of which have been significantly weakened by the recent loss of their top leadership. Nevertheless, the Urabenos would face a number of challenges should they attempt to expand their operations in Colombia's Eastern Plains. For one, the organization is already under significant pressure from the Colombian government, which is conducting a massive manhunt for ""Otoniel"" and has promised to continue an aerial bombing campaign against the group. And aside from their links to the Libertadores, the Urabenos have little in the way of established networks or criminal infrastructure in the region, which is separated from their traditional coastal strongholds by the Andes mountain range. Given these conditions, it is possible that a move to deepen involvement in the Eastern Plains could spread the Urabenos too thin. On the other hand, the region's criminal landscape is clearly in a period of transition, which could facilitate the creation of new alliances. In the event of a peace agreement between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), the Urabenos may try to partner with criminalized elements of the FARC's Eastern Bloc in order to consolidate control of the region's lucrative drug trade.

"Under the Gaze of Police, Residents Flee El Salvador Gangs. More than ten families abandon their homes, fleeing the threat of massacre from Barrio 18. A man cries furiously as he will have to sleep in the flophouse room of a family member with his three children. The head of the National Civil Police's anti-gang unit arrives on the scene and asks people to pray. This is the flight of many families from the San Valentin condominiums in Mejicanos, located in San Salvador's Metropolitan Area. This is happening today, Tuesday 20 January. In fact many people are watching from their homes as they eat lunch, as if it were a soccer game being broadcast live on TV. This is how, live and direct, more than ten families are fleeing their homes in San Valentin condominium in Mejicanos. The cameras are recording them and the police are protecting them. The police are protecting people believed to be threatened by the Barrio 18 gang. The gang said it would do something last week. The people did nothing. The gang said it would kill them. Many people believe them, so they are leaving. They are fleeing live on national television. Here, the condominium's heat is suffocating. It's noon. People began emptying their apartments around ten in the morning because the 24-hour period the gang warned them about ends at seven tonight. Afterwards comes the massacre, the gang has promised. The people are exhausted from moving beds, refrigerators, televisions, chairs They sweat but keep working because they truly believe seven tonight is the time limit for anyone who doesn't want to be massacred to get away from here. *This article originally appeared in El Faro 's Sala Negra and has been translated and reprinted with permission. See original here. The San Valentin condominium is in the Delicias del Norte suburb, in the Mejicanos municipality. You find it before arriving at the Finca Argentina, a few blocks from the route 2-C bus stop. Although perhaps two other facts would be better references. The San Valentin condominium complex is four blocks from where assassins killed Giovanni Morales, known as ""El Destino"" (Destiny) and a member of the Mara Salvatrucha gang, on March 6, 2013. Morales was a veteran of the Mara clique Guanacos Criminal Salvatruchos, which has its headquarters further up in the high part of the suburb of Montreal. Afterwards comes the massacre, the gang has promised. Morales' killing was famous because he was an aide to Father Antonio Rodriguez, who was accused of abetting gangs and forced by the Attorney General to leave the country for his native Spain last year. But if someone doesn't remember Father Tono or El Destino, they'll surely remember another reference. The San Valentin condominium is six blocks from where, on June 20, 2010, Barrio 18 members alongside members of the Columbia Locos Surenos crew, from the Jardin suburb, set fire to a route 47 bus with the passengers aboard. 17 people died. Some burned to death while others were riddled with bullets as they tried to escape through the windows. The route ends in the suburb of Buenos Aires, part of Mejicanos and controlled by the Mara Salvatrucha. However, to get there the route runs through a large section of territory controlled by Barrio 18. Dispute over the area's control led to this insane event which turned the world upside down. Here, in the middle of all this death, are the San Valentin condominiums. Some 46 families live here. They are condominiums without any specific architectural style. A cement walkway is the backbone between gates which give access to the surrounding streets. Perpendicular to this concrete pathway, passages open to rows of small houses, below and above. Three passageways and the central column, where there are also houses. Tiny houses. An all-in-one bedroom-dining room-kitchen-living room. A single space and a bathroom. People here are experts in converting rooms into multipurpose areas. At night blankets lay on the ground and chairs are stacked on the table. During the day blankets are stored on tiny clotheslines and chairs are moved back to ground at the dinner table or in front of the TV. It is in these San Valentin condominiums where families are dismantling their homes while we journalists ask them why, and the police guard their escape. On the lower part of a walkway a family sweats and cries. Since ten in the morning they have been moving couches, appliances and blankets. They pack what little fits onto a pickup truck. The truck goes and returns to take a little more. Only the adults of the family are here. Two men in their 20s, a woman over 50, a pregnant woman over 40 and a 20-year-old woman. The two men's wives and their four children have all left to a sister-in-law's house. They didn't stay for the hurried move. The kids are just babies. The oldest child is six years old. The whole family rents three tiny houses in the San Valentin complex. Each house costs $100 a month to rent. Most of it was paid through their work as car window washers at a stoplight in San Salvador. The pickup truck has just left and is headed to a cousin's house, in a complex very much like this one. Some of the family will sleep there until they find a new place. Others will go to flophouse room of one of the men's parents, and hope they are not all kicked out if the owners find out they are putting more people in the room than they are supposed to. Although the complex they are being evicted from is surrounded by daily violence, the family insists it was not a housing area known for gang activity. That said, it's all relative. For the working class of this country, the gangs are never far away. It can only ever be a problem a little further away. A few months ago ""four gang girls"" moved into the second condominium house -- reached by the primary gate. Condominium residents took notice. At night, tattooed young men from the Jardin suburb, gang members of Barrio 18, would visit them. They drank and laughed. No one from the condominium messed with them. The men of the family I'm talking to tell the story. The women intermittently cry as they watch their house becoming no longer their house On Tuesday at least five families awoke with a clear thought: flee. Last Saturday, January 17, police raided the ""gang girls'"" house. As it was an illegally occupied house, the police took everything inside, but the girls were not there, neighbors said. The police did their job. They responded to a complaint. They dismantled an illegally occupied house, took what was inside and left. This is the problem. The gangs don't leave. They're part of the social framework. They live here, they are children of some of the women who live here and siblings to men and women who live here. They are parents, uncles and friends to some people who live in these areas. The gangs are part of El Salvador. The gangs are as rooted to their neighborhood, their suburb, as the local corner store. The girls returned. Seven condominium residents - who are currently fleeing their homes - confirmed with me that on Sunday the girls returned, accompanied by two gang members armed with pistols. The group turned to one of the neighbors and told them, among other things, to inform the community that the girls wanted their house refurnished, that ""the rat"" -- as they said -- who had informed the police of their presence was part of the community, therefore the community had to replace their door, refrigerator, television, stove, kitchen table and chairs, sofas Additionally, they wanted the community to sign a letter saying the girls were rightful inhabitants of San Valentin. Or there was plan B -- they asked for a new apartment in the complex, paid for and refurnished by the community. According to one resident, the girls told them if neither option was carried out, the gang would kill several people in San Valentin. The neighbor who received the message began to pack. He was the first to believe the threat. On Monday, after having passed on the message to many neighbors, the man received another message via telephone. It was the same threat with something extra: ""you have 24 hours to comply or there will be a massacre."" The man showed the message to many people, including a member of the family I'm currently watching take apart their house. Panic in the condominium began on Monday night. He cries profoundly humiliated. Looking down at the floor with his head turned, despite his efforts. Someone told the police they were being threatened and some arrived to stay the night at the condominium and dissuade people who were already murmuring about leaving. On Tuesday at least five families awoke with a clear thought: flee. These five scared five more and by noon 17 families packed their stuff in trucks, pickups, old cars, where ever they could, and escaped to another area, controlled by the same or a different gang. Each knew what their strategy would be. ""This is one of the key things"" - a member of one of the families of windows washers told me. ""Now where do we go? There are gangs in any place we might live. There are gangs in any place below 300 dollars a month. Where do we go? What are we going to say if gang members there ask us where we are coming from? If they're from Barrio 18 they won't be happy with what happened here. If they're of a different gang, they won't want us there. Right now we only know we're leaving, afterwards we'll see what we will do."" The man finishes speaking -- a tough man, whose life has led him to window washing. The man is silent. The man tries to hold back his tears. He doesn't cry with abandon like his aunt at his side. She is crying continuously and constantly drying her eyes with a handkerchief. The man cries without wanting to cry, or at least without wanting others to see his tears. He tries not to cry but does and turns his head. He cries deeply. His stomach wracked by spasms. He cries, humiliated. ""Humiliated,"" he says. He, who cleans car windows all damn day on a corner in this hot and sunny country, has to move his home that he furnished and rented through window cleaning, because girls caked in makeup threatened the whole community. He, who after all day begging, lowered his gaze when he saw them pass. He, who lived in these condominiums under the motto ""don't mess with those girls."" He, who always thought, ""from work to the house to shut myself in."" He now has to leave because the girls have backing from a gang. The other man sees him crying and begins to cry as well. He cries like his brother-in-law. He cries profoundly humiliated. Looking down at the floor with his head turned, despite his efforts. Today they and their children will sleep crowded together in another condominium or in a flophouse room. They'll sleep crowded together, and tomorrow will go back to cleaning windows. It's one in the afternoon and the fleeing families are being guarded by seven public security police. Suddenly, 15 police in ski-masks enter the complex. They are accompanied by their boss, the assistant director of the police in charge of the anti-gang unit, Pedro Gonzalez. The flight was televised. The nation can eat lunch while watching people flee. Something has to be done. The anti-gang police kick all media out of the apartment complex. I was at the end of one of the passages and am able to stay. Gonzalez calls out to the people, ""Gather around please, call everybody and come. There's no cameras, we've removed the media for a minute to give you this message."" A few residents gather. Some 12 people. The rest continue hurriedly fleeing or stay in their homes. A woman leaves her home and says, ""I'm coming myself because my husband suffers from a heart condition."" Gonzalez asks people to wash their clothes, cook their lunch, watch TV and return to their homes. He says he's brought police officers with him. He tells them to carry on with life. That his people will capture ""all the gang members."" He tells them: ""We're going to take away all the gang members in these areas."" He shouts out a strange order into the air: ""Comb the area!"" Before his orders, the police officers are motionless. He asks, finally, for the people to pray. He tells them: ""It doesn't matter who here is Catholic or Evangelical. Raise a prayer, that is what's important, ask God."" He asks someone to volunteer to lead the prayer. The people just watch. The police commissioner insists, please, that someone offers to lead the prayer. No one. He asks a woman in front of him, a 70 year old woman ""who looks devoted,"" to pray. She doesn't, but a woman by her side finally does. In between prayers I write in my notebook: ""God, put an angel at each door."" The families of window washers continue their flight. Some ten families continue to leave their homes as the nation's biggest anti-gang police head asks them to stay and promises to protect them. In between prayers I write in my notebook: ""God, put an angel at each door."" These roughly 50 people don't believe he can protect them. Minutes later, Gonzalez tells me something his boss, the head of the police, as well as the head of the Ministry of Security and Justice, has told him on many occasions: ""It's also a question of perception of the situation."" Yes, it's possible that the threats were just a bluff. In fact, some families have decided to stay. They believed it was more talk than action. However, who can call the people who left cowards? The gangs have killed four blocks south of here. The gangs have massacred, burned and shot people six blocks north of here. Just ten days ago the gangs killed the child of the pupusa vendor of this complex. They kidnaped him, right outside, while he was carrying a cylinder of gas, and they dropped his body off a day later nearby in the Panama neighborhood. Yes, this does have to do with perceptions, but perceptions of a threat both real and fatal. This is not like someone's perception of the weather and deciding to bring a jacket or a T-shirt. This is not the perception of someone thinking robbers might steal their car. This is the perception of someone who has to decide whether or not to believe that tonight, this very night, they will come to slaughter your family. Yes or no? Should I take the gamble? The prayer proposed by police director Gonzalez is over. Hours later they will present the arrest of six people from nearby neighborhood, believed to be part of Barrio 18. Here in the San Valentin condominiums a woman asks: ""So will the police stay?"" Gonzalez says: ""They'll stay here until you feel safer."" The woman responds: ""And after that? When they leave? And when we get on the bus to take the kids to school? When we're coming back from work?"" The woman leaves to continue packing to escape. Another woman asks: ""Could you leave police at each gate permanently?"" The gathering has already broken up and no one is responding. *This article originally appeared in El Faro 's Sala Negra and has been translated and reprinted with permission.

"Extent of Mexico Human Trafficking Obscured by Lack of Info. A four-year analysis of human trafficking in Mexico by the National Citizen Observatory has found persistently high levels of impunity for the crime, demonstrating how incomplete and contradictory official information helps bury the true scope of the problem. The study ( pdf ), which examines the period January 2010 through July 2013, collates statistics from departments focused on human trafficking in the 31 Mexican states, the Federal District, and the federal government. Over the time period, 16 states reported a total of 846 victims, while the rest failed to provide information. Jalisco had the highest number of victims, with 283, representing about a third of the total. This was followed by Baja California, with 136, and Puebla, with 122. The national Attorney General's Office (PGR) registered 347 victims during this time period, and the Ministerial Federal Police (PFM) registered 121. Information regarding sex, age and nationality was provided for only a portion of the total victims reported by these states. Of these, around 87 percent were women and approximately the same percent were victims of sex trafficking. Over 90 percent of victims were single. The PGR's numbers reflected a similar tendency, with females representing around 80 percent of total victims. According to state information, slightly over half of victims of a determined age were under 18. The highest number of both minors and women was reported in Baja California. States reported that 95 percent of total victims were Mexican nationals, while federal figures showed a different pattern. The PFM indicated a large number of victims were undocumented migrants, and the PGR reported around 48 percent of 276 victims were foreign. Of these, the majority were Guatemalan, followed by Hondurans, Haitians and Salvadorans. The number of arrests during the period was small compared with the total number of victims, and the number of convictions much smaller. According to information from 16 states, a total of 275 arrests were made, with Puebla and Baja California together responsible for half of these. In nine states, 94 judicial processes were opened over the period, led by Tlaxcala and Baja California, with 31 each. Puebla failed to provide information on judicial processes. Between all responding states, just 17 convictions occurred between 2010 and mid-2013, with seven of these in Tlaxcala and four in Baja California. The Federal District's Superior Court of Justice (TSJDF) reported 89 judicial processes opened for human trafficking between 2011 and June 2013, and 24 more processes for the trafficking of children and others incapable of resistance, but did not provide information on sentencing. On a national level, the PGR's special anti-trafficking unit, FEVIMTRA, opened just 30 judicial processes over the period, according to the information provided to the National Citizen Observatory (ONC). Regarding the results, the ONC expressed concern not only over the extremely low percentage of sentences compared to victims -- just two convictions per hundred victims, based on state figures -- but also the failure of both state and national authorities to provide adequate, accurate or timely responses. Supplying this information is, the ONC noted, a legal obligation of these various authorities, and ""doing so is not only necessary but indispensable for the generation and objective evaluation of public policies that could integrally address the phenomenon of human trafficking in our country."" The study is limited in its ability to illustrate human trafficking trends and patterns due to the large gaps in information collected, with many states and national bodies failing to provide adequate figures. It does, however, highlight the current impunity enjoyed by traffickers, which helps to facilitate the crime. The number of victims listed in the ONC report is tiny compared to the estimated scope of the problem. A former Mexican congresswoman said in 2012 the country sees 800,000 adults and 20,000 children trafficked for sexual exploitation each year. The regional NGO, the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women and Girls in Latin America and the Caribbean (CATWLAC), reported in 2010 that around 1.2 million people in Mexico were victims of human trafficking. The two states the ONC lists as having the highest number of victims are home to three cities that have been identified among 13 human trafficking hotspots : Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara in Jalisco, and Tijuana in Baja California. Tlaxcala, which led the way for convictions, was the site of a major sex trafficking bust in 2011. However, the study fails to reflect the importance of other routes, such as Nuevo Laredo in Tamaulipas. Mexico is considered a Tier 2 (out of three levels) country by the US State Department as a source, transit point and destination for human trafficking. It is the second most prominent country of origin for victims trafficked to the United States after Thailand, according to the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH). Echoing the ONC information, the State Department indicates the majority of foreign victims in Mexico are from its Central American neighbors -- Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- while victims from the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa have also been identified. The country's trade is evolving: formerly dominated by small networks, it is now a major source of profits for criminal organizations once dedicated to drug trafficking. Teresa Ulloa, the regional head of CATWLAC, says the trade is a $10 billion a year industry for Mexico's cartels, with the Zetas one of the groups most heavily involved in recent years. In 2013, a Salvadoran trafficker testified he sold migrants to the group for $800 each. Methodology is also changing. Many women and children are lured into the sex trade with false promises of better livelihoods or through romantic relationships, but pimps have also reportedly begun using young female victims to recruit other underage girls. Victims of sex trafficking continue getting younger , says Ulloa. Mexico has not been blind to the problem. The country passed its first federal law targeting human trafficking in November 2007 , and legislation has since continued to emerge. By 2012, 23 states had laws specifically targeting trafficking and in June 2012, the country passed a new, more comprehensive law to combat the crime. This general law requires compliance from all levels of government, widens the scope of crimes considered human trafficking, establishes prison sentences up to 40 years for related crimes and provides for increased inter-agency coordination, says the ONC. Further revisions to the 2012 law are currently under review. Nonetheless, these legal measures have not stopped Mexico's human traffickers from enjoying widespread impunity, as the conspicuous lack of prosecutions over the past four years demonstrates. This is a common problem in countries around the region, including Argentina and Brazil : human trafficking legislation advances, but the situation changes little for the victims. The nature of human trafficking makes prosecution difficult -- the chain of exploitation can involve numerous groups and participants, and victims of sex trafficking are often reluctant to testify. However, as the ONC states regarding Mexico, it is also a problem of ""capacity, will and awareness."" The region's judicial systems are notoriously inefficient and overloaded, and officials are often complicit in the crime. Cases of bribery, extortion, falsification of victims' identity documents, and abuses of victims have been reported among Mexican officials, according to the State Department. The shortages in information provided to the ONC by the federal and state governments, while damaging to the study, serve to further highlight the current inefficiencies in the system -- a lack of transparent or accessible figures reduces Mexico's capacity to combat human trafficking. As noted by the ONC, the collection of human trafficking statistics is complicated by the unwillingness of many victims to report, out of fear or humiliation. However, the inadequacy of the figures also demonstrates a clear failure to address a massive and growing problem."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"WikiLeaks: US Gave Intel that Led to Cartel Leaders Death. A U.S. government cable, reprinted in full here, from the U.S. Embassy in Mexico and various Washington government agencies says an ""Embassy interagency"" gave Mexican Marines (SEMAR) the location of Arturo Beltran Leyva, so marines could move in and raid the safe house, killing Beltan Leyva and four of his associates on December 16, 2009. The intel was originally given to the Mexican army (SEDENA), whose ""refusal to move quickly reflected a risk aversion ,"" the cable obtained via WikiLeaks adds. The revelation takes something away from what was President Felipe Calderon's biggest victory to date. Arturo was the head of the Beltran Leyva Organization, a massive criminal enterprise. And while U.S. officials have long whispered how much intelligence they were passing the Mexicans, little is said publicly about matters of inter-governmental operations. Highlights from the cable dated 17 December 2009 : [SEMAR]'s success puts the Army (SEDENA) in the difficult position of explaining why it has been reluctant to act on good intelligence and conduct operations against high-level targets. The U.S. interagency originally provided the information to SEDENA, whose refusal to move quickly reflected a risk aversion that cost the institution a major counternarcotics victory Public Security Secretary (SSP) Genaro Garcia Luna can also be counted as a net loser in the Mexican interagency following the ABL [Arturo Beltran Leyva] operation.

Reason: 1.4 (b),(d). 1. (S) Summary. Mexican Navy forces acting on U.S. information killed Arturo Beltran Leyva in an operation on December 16, the highest-level takedown of a cartel figure under the Calderon administration. The operation is a clear victory for the Mexican Government and an example of excellent USG-GOM cooperation. The unit that conducted the operation had recieved extensive U.S. training. Arturo Beltran Leyva's death will not solve Mexico's drug problem, but it will hopefully generate the momentum necessary to make sustained progress against other drug trafficking organizations. End Summary. The Operation --------- 2. (S) Mexican Navy (SEMAR) sources revealed on the night of December 17 that SEMAR forces killed Arturo Beltran Leyva (ABL), head of the Beltran Leyva Organization, during a shoot-out in Cuernavaca (approximately 50 miles south of Mexico City) that afternoon. At least three other cartel operatives were killed during the raid, with a fourth committing suicide. While it still has not been confirmed, Embassy officials believe the latter to be ABL's brother, Hector, which would mean that all Beltran Leyva brothers are either dead or in prison. Arturo Beltran Leyva has a long history of involvement in the Mexican drug trade, and worked with Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman and his Sinaloa Cartel before splitting in 2008. The rivalry between the Sinaloa and Beltran Leyva organizations has been a key factor driving the escalating levels of narcotics-related violence in recent years. Born in Sinaloa, ABL has been key to the importation and distribution of cocaine and heroin in the United States, and also has extensive money laundering capabilities, corruption networks, and international contacts in Colombia and the U.S. 3. (C) Embassy law enforcement officials say that the arrest operation targeting ABL began about a week prior to his death when the Embassy relayed detailed information on his location to SEMAR. The SEMAR unit has been trained extensively by NORTHCOM over the past several years. SEMAR raided an identified location, where they killed several ABL bodyguards and arrested over 23 associates, while ABL and Hector escaped. On Monday, the Embassy interagency linked ABL to an apartment building located in Cuernavaca (about an hour south of Mexico City), where ABL was in hiding. SEMAR initiated an arrest operation on Wednesday afternoon, surrounding the identified apartment complex, and establishing a security perimeter. ABL's forces fired on the SEMAR operatives and engaged in a sustained firefight that wounded three SEMAR marines and possibly killed one. SEMAR forces evacuated residents of the apartment complex to the gym, according to press accounts, and no civilian casualties have so far been reported. The Mexican Interagency --------------- 4. (S) The successful operation against ABL comes on the heels of an aggressive SEMAR effort in Monterrey against Zeta forces (ref a) and highlights its emerging role as a key player in the counternarcotics fight. SEMAR is well-trained, well-equipped, and has shown itself capable of responding quickly to actionable intelligence. Its success puts the Army (SEDENA) in the difficult position of explaining why it has been reluctant to act on good intelligence and conduct operations against high-level targets. The U.S. interagency originally provided the information to SEDENA, whose refusal to move quickly reflected a risk aversion that cost the institution a major counternarcotics victory. SEDENA did provide backup to SEMAR during the firefight with ABL forces, but can take little credit for the operation. Public Security Secretary (SSP) Genaro Garcia Luna can also be counted as a net loser in the Mexican interagency following the ABL operation. SSP considers high-level Beltran Leyva targets to be its responsibility, and Garcia Luna has already MEXICO 00003573 002 OF 003 said privately that the operation should have been his. The Impact on Violence --------------- 5. (S) It is early to say with a great degree of confidence what kind of effect ABL's death will have on levels of narco-related violence in Mexico. A spike is probably likely in the short term as inter- and intra-cartel battles are intensified by the sudden leadership gap in one of the country's most important cartels. With all the Beltran Leyva brothers likely dead or in prison, there are a number of other cartel functionaries likely to vie for the leadership slot. Moreover, rival organizations may intensify efforts to expand their influence in the disarray likely to follow ABL's death. At the very least, efforts to clean the Beltran Leyva house and rout out suspected informers will be bloody, and retaliation by the organization against Mexican law enforcement or military officials is not out of the cards. 6. (C) In the medium to longer term, ABL's death could have the potential to lower the level of narco-violence rates. ABL himself was a particularly violent leader with numerous effective assassin teams. Moreover, the Sinaloa-Beltran Leyva rivalry has been responsible for a large number of narcotics-related homicides in Mexico, and also largely personally driven by the Beltran Leyva brothers themselves. Emboffs speculate that Beltran Leyva associates, under pressure and perhaps more vulnerable due to leadership deficiencies, could move to align more closely again with Sinaloa, which they might think offers a more natural protection than the Zetas. The Boost for Calderon --------------- 7. (C) SEMAR's successful operation against ABL is a major victory for President Calderon and his war against organized crime. ABL is the highest ranking target taken down by the Calderon government, and his status as one of the most important and long-standing of Mexican drug traffickers makes his takedown even more symbolically important. President Calderon has openly admitted to having a tough year -- his party lost big in the midterm elections, he is confronting an economic crisis, and nationwide homicide rates continue to climb -- and contacts have told Poloff that he has seemed ""down"" in meetings. The SEMAR operation is undoubtedly a huge boost for him, both in terms of bolstering public support for his security efforts and in reassuring himself that important security accomplishments in this area are possible. Calderon's political opponents will also find it far less useful to accuse the President of hanging on to an ineffective anti-crime strategy that nets numerous mid- to low-level cartel figures but fails to rein in the major kingpins. The major Mexico City dailies have run front page Beltran Leyva stories, and President Calderon's remarks in a press conference from Copenhagen highlighting that the operation represents an ""important achievement for the Mexican people and government"" were widely covered. Comment ----- 8. (S) The operation against Arturo Beltran Leyva is a clear victory for the Mexican Government and an example of excellent USG-GOM cooperation. Seamless Embassy interagency collaboration combined with a willing, capable, and ready SEMAR produced one of the greatest successes to date in the counternarcotics fight. ABL's death will provide an important boost to Calderon and hopefully will cultivate a greater sense of confidence within Mexican security agencies that will encourage them to take greater advantage of similar opportunities. SEMAR's win in particular may encourage SEDENA to be more proactive and less risk averse in future operations. ABL's death will certainly not resolve Mexico's drug problem, but it will likely generate the momentum necessary within the GOM security apparatus to make sustained and real progress against the country's drug trafficking organizations.

"Iguala Massacre: Mexicos PR Message Goes Up in Flames. The stunning, dramatic blow-by-blow account of what most likely happened to the 43 missing students in Guerrero is an indication of just how desperately Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto and his team are trying to perform damage control on a terrifying story -- one that has not only unsettled his government, but has pushed them to admit that things are not as their public relations machine would have you believe. In the hour-long November 7 press conference (see video below), Attorney General Jose Murillo Karam announced that the recent capture of alleged members of the Guerreros Unidos led to confessions that the students were taken by police while en route to the town of Iguala. The police handed the students over to the Guerreros Unidos, who then killed them and burned their remains. Specifically, video testimonies from three recently captured ""masterminds"" of the attacks revealed that the students were carted like cattle to a landfill in Cocula. According to one suspect, approximately 15 students asphyxiated on the way to the dump site. The remaining students were interrogated by members of the Guerreros Unidos before being shot and killed. The bodies were then thrown into the landfill, arranged in a circle, covered in sticks, gasoline, and diesel, and burned. The fire reportedly lasted for 14 hours, from midnight on September 27, until mid-afternoon. According to the testimonies, a leader of the criminal group known as ""El Terco"" ordered the burned human remains to be collected and placed into eight black plastic bags. Members of the Guerreros Unidos then took the bags to the San Juan River in Cocula, where they dumped the contents into the water, while two bags were thrown directly into the river. Following the confessions, search teams found black bags, one of which was still closed. Mexican and Argentine forensic teams reportedly confirmed the bag contained human remains. However, due to the degree to which the bodies were burned, forensic experts have not yet determined when the remains will be able to be identified. Murillo began with a rare pledge of transparency in the investigation. ""Let's talk about developments [in the case] step-by-step,"" Murillo remarked before giving the full account -- complete with accompanying photos, videos, and maps -- of what allegedly happened to the missing students. For this government, which has prided itself on talking about everything but crime, this is an incredible, and telling, about-face. Pena Nieto entered office promising that this is ""Mexico's moment,"" and has done everything in his power -- including hiring a high-end lobbying firm in Washington DC -- to turn the narrative away from crime. This initially worked, particularly in the US, where Pena Nieto has been celebrated by a New York Times columnist , Time magazine , and many others. But inside Mexico, Iguala is not the beginning of the problem, it is the final straw for a country that remains saturated in organized crime despite numerous high-profile arrests. A June poll ranked ""public security"" as the country's number one problem, ahead of a slumping economy. The president's poll numbers have also tanked this year. The Iguala crisis really began at a local level. According to Murillo, it was the mayor of Iguala, Jose Luis Abarca, and his wife who ordered police to stop four trucks carrying the students traveling from the rural town Ayotzinapa to Iguala. Abarca and his wife have since been captured, as indicated below in InSight Crime's timeline of the Iguala crisis. Things then moved to the state level, when Guerrero's governor resigned. Now it has reached the national level, with regular protests and -- thanks to a Murillo gaffe at the end of the press conference in which he quipped, ""I'm tired"" (""Ya me canse"") -- now a hashtag. It is disingenuous to say that Pena Nieto has done nothing to combat crime. He has made different security agencies work more in concert, leading to the capture of the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, Beltran Leyva Organization, Juarez Cartel and the Zetas. But the next phase of combatting organized crime -- as Colombia is currently experiencing -- is more chaotic and more difficult to control. The blatant way in which Iguala's mayor-police-criminal alliance functioned was a result of this chaos, but also the result of a belief that such actions rarely result in real consequences in Mexico. None of Pena Nieto's policies -- as laudable as they may be -- have changed this dynamic. Until his government makes criminal groups realize that they can't capture, execute, and burn students with impunity, there is no PR or lobbying firm in the world that will be able to bury this story."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Brazil Corruption Investigations to Target More Top Politicians: Reports. Hundreds of new corruption investigations could stem from testimony provided by executives of Brazil's biggest construction firm, media reports suggest, raising questions about the potential impact of the South American country's long-running and expansive anti-graft drive. Carlos Lima, one of the leading prosecutors in Brazil's so-called ""Car Wash"" investigation, told Reuters on March 14 that ""there will be upward of 350 new investigations that will begin"" as a result of testimony obtained through plea deals with executives of the now-infamous Odebrecht construction giant. In December 2016, Odebrecht publicly admitted that a so-called ""Department of Bribery"" within the company paid hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes in a dozen countries over the course of more than a decade in order to obtain public works contracts, many of which were left unfinished. Brazilian authorities have made extensive use of plea bargain agreements to secure testimony from top suspects in the massive corruption scandal, which also involved the state-run oil firm Petrobras, among other companies. The information obtained through the plea deals has already implicated a number of political and economic elites , including current Brazilian President Michel Temer. Now, the investigation could ensnare ""almost everyone who has had any power over the past 10 to 20 years,"" the Guardian reports. ""Five members of the cabinet, two former presidents -- Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff -- the current and former heads of both houses of Congress and at least two former opposition leaders -- Aecio Neves and Jose Serra -- are among the 83 politicians whose accusations were referred on Tuesday to the supreme court, according to local media,"" the news outlet reported. The Guardian added that Attorney General Rodrigo Janot had also reportedly referred 211 other cases to lower courts on March 14. Temer is not among those whose accusations Janot referred, the news outlet reported, describing the omission of the president from the list as ""mysterious."" The judicial files are still officially under seal, so InSight Crime was not able to independently verify these reports. Media reports have circulated for weeks suggesting the files may soon be unsealed. Sources close to the Car Wash investigation have previously described contents of the testimonies obtained through the plea agreements as a ""time bomb,"" a ""tsunami,"" and ""the end of the world"" due to their potential to mar the reputations of so many in the highest echelons of Brazilian politics. But questions remain as to whether the revelations will lead to lasting changes in Brazil's notoriously corrupt political system. The New York Times reports that Congress is considering strategies for granting amnesty to those who could be targeted by the anti-graft investigations. This could shield some potential defendants from prosecution, but public opposition is likely to prove a major obstacle to such a move. Previous similar proposals have been met with widespread outrage in Brazil. However, even in the absence of an amnesty law, the significant expansion of the corruption probe could unite Brazil's typically fractious political landscape around the goal of derailing the investigations. Gil Castello Branco, the director of an anti-corruption watchdog group in Brazil, told the New York Times, ""We have a saying in Brazil: 'When the jungle is in flames, the beasts unite' Well, the fire has been lit, and all these politicians want to do is save their own skin."" Fernando Limongi, a professor at the University of Sao Paulo, made similar comments to the Guardian. ""All the politicians are now in the same boat,"" Limongi said. ""What will happen is that the political class as a whole will look for a way out."""	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Busts Zetas Luxury Narco-Ranch. Federal troops in north Mexico recently discovered a luxury ranch where 200 gunmen from the Zetas gang lived, trained, and launched attacks, offering a vivid illustration of the impunity with which such groups operate in much of the country. The authorities came across the property earlier this month, in the aftermath of a series of gun battles in a remote region in the state of Nuevo Leon, news agency EFE reports. Authorities said that the ranch, known as Las Aguilas and located on the outskirts of small town called Vallecillo, was the largest facility that the group operated, and served both as a training ground and a launching pad for attacks. The town is just 75 miles north of Monterrey, one of Mexico's largest cities and the site of an ongoing struggle for control between the Zetas and their rivals in the Gulf Cartel. Las Aguilas was reportedly filled with items like pool tables, expensive liquors, and stuffed heads of animals, and decorated with trendy furniture and accessories. Authorities also found more than a hundred livestock and other farm animals on the property, as well as various trucks and heavy machinery. The fighting between the government and the Zetas in Vallecillo began with an ambush of a federal police convoy on October 11, which precipitated a flood of federal troops -- both police and army -- into the area. A series of confrontations led to the death of 21 alleged Zetas and the arrest of 12 more, including the man authorities say served as the group's local leader: Marco Garza de Leon, alias ""El Chabelo."" Authorities say that some 150 Zetas managed to escape arrest, and have now fled the region. Two federal police and one soldier were killed in various shootouts. The Zetas began to put down roots in Vallecillo and its surrounding communities about a year ago, according to locals. In addition to establishing a base at Las Aguilas, the group began to extort local businesses and harass residents of Vallecillo, which caused many to flee the area. Only 2,000 or so residents remain today, and reporters from various media outlets said they found the streets virtually deserted. The group's operation in Vallecillo offers another demonstration of the extreme vulnerability of Mexico's rural areas. While bigger cities can often fall back on federal troop deployments in the event of an upsurge in violence, thousands of smaller cities typically lie far from the administration's radar screen. This, of course, encourages gangs like the Zetas to set up shop in smaller cities, where there is little impediment to them operating openly. Local governments have few resources, and are generally incapable of standing up to the larger criminal groups. In Vallecillo, for instance, there were just 11 municipal officers earlier this month, and nine of them resigned after the outbreak of violence. Today, is patrolled by just two local police, though federal troops remains in the area. Other examples of small cities' vulnerability are legion in northern Mexico. In Ciudad Mier , which lies along the Texas border in Tamaulipas, virtually all of the town's 5,000 residents fled in fall 2010 as a result of fighting between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. Many small towns in the state of Chihuahua, which has been Mexico's most violent for the past several years, have suffered a similar fate; according to a further report from EFE, Guadalupe's population has dropped by 30 percent from 2005 through 2010, while the number of residents in Praxedis G. Guerrero has declined by 43 percent. Ranches used by drug traffickers, labelled ""narcoranchos,"" have been uncovered with regularity during the past several years. The gangs' appropriation of property for criminal activities often leads to conflicts with their new neighbors. In one of the more famous episodes , the Zetas' attempts to wrest control of a ranch in Tamaulipas in November, 2010 led to a shootout between gunmen and the ranch's owner, who refused to cede ownership. The owner, 77-year-old Alejo Garza , killed four alleged Zetas and wounded another two before being killed himself. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
2011 Sees Over 300 Child Soldiers Demobilize in Colombia. Colombian authorities say 328 child soldiers have demobilized from illegal armed groups so far this year. Elvira Forero, director of the Colombian Family Welfare Institute ( Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar ) or ICBF, told Congress that 85 percent of the children who demobilized are boys and the remainder are girls. The agency is currently handling the cases of about 500 children once involved in the country's civil conflict. The majority are recruited to the ranks of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC ) and the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN ). According to the agency, child recruitment remains a particularly acute problem in Colombia's conflict zones, including the Pacific department of Choco and the southern border departments of Putumayo, Narino and Cauca. The FARC have also been known to recruit youths in Ecuador. According to the 2008 Child Soldiers Global Report, the FARC and ELN routinely recruit children to serve as soldiers, informants and as logistical support. Last year, the FARC were accused of paying a child 1,000 pesos (about 50 cents) to carry a bomb in El Charco, Narino which later detonated. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Data Highlights Police Violence in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The Brazilian state of Sao Paulo saw more police killings in 20 years than there were in 50 US states. In an interview with a Brazilian security expert, investigative news outlet Ponte analyzes the implications of these numbers. Sao Paulo's military police killed 11,358 people over the last 20 years, according to data from the Sao Paulo Military Police Intelligence Center obtained by Ponte. That number is greater than all the killings committed by US police during the same period. Another 1,248 military police officers were killed in Sao Paulo state during that time. All of the deaths, both civilian and military police, include crimes committed by on-duty and off-duty police officers, and include cases in which the military police were the victims. The data is taken from July 1995 -- when the state government began keeping track of police killings -- and August 2015. This article was originally published by Ponte. It was translated, edited for clarity, and republished by InSight Crime with permission. See the original here. Even though Sao Paulo's population is 7.5 times smaller than the United States -- where about 319 million people are served by approximately 17,000 members of law enforcement agencies -- Sao Paulo state (population 43 million) police are 53 times more violent than those in the entire US. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reports that US police kill an average of 369 people each year. In Sao Paulo state, data from military police intelligence shows that on average, 563 are killed annually by military police. ""There are many serious and extremely competent people in the military police. But military police culture prevents people from thinking independently."" While Sao Paulo's military police killed 11,358 people between 1995 and 2015, in the US, police killed 11,090 people over a 30-year period (1983 to 2012). According to Rafael Alcadipani, a professor at the Sao Paulo School of Business Administration and a Visiting Scholar at Boston College, ""many people are deliberately executed"" by the military police of Sao Paulo. Read Ponte's interview with Alcadipani below: Ponte: Data from the Sao Paulo Military Police Intelligence Center shows that between July 1995 and August of this year, military police killed 11,358 people in Sao Paulo state. What's behind this? The death toll includes deaths by military police on and off-duty. Rafael Alcadipani : There are numerous factors to consider and we need to distinguish those deaths that happened on-duty and those that happened off-duty. Killings committed by off-duty police may be related to ""bico"" [secondary police employment]. Police salaries are very low and almost everyone works while off-duty, often in private security. Then they get involved in incidents, and as they're doing their ""bico"" work, they are often outnumbered. There are cases of police officers who are involved in crime and commit murders related to crimes. There are also police who may interfere in police operations, without calling support and all that. For on-duty cops, there are two types of killings: legitimate resistance and illegitimate. There are cases in which in order to protect himself or others, the officer has to ""neutralize"" the criminal. There are also cases where the police kill out of pure wickedness or do not believe that the justice system will help solve anything. But without doubt, there are many people who are deliberately executed by the military police. Ponte: Between July 1995 and August this year, 1,248 military police were killed and were either not working or on vacation. How can this be analyzed within the context of public security? Rafael Alcadipani : Many police officers are working in their second job and may not have any support. They engage in events that generate confrontations and they end up getting killed. There are also cases of police officers who are killed because of their involvement in crime. The situation with Brazil's police is quite fragile. They are very close to crime, and they are also greatly weakened due to their work conditions. Ponte: Brazil is debating possibly implementing a series of reforms known as the ""full cycle"" for the military police [Currently, under Brazilian law, the state military police are charged with maintaining order and conducting patrols, while the civil police investigate crimes. The ""full cycle"" reforms would give the military police power to also investigate crimes]. How can military police violence be affected, if the military also begin to carry out investigative police duties? Rafael Alcadipani : The ""full cycle"" is a good idea that could turn into a huge disaster. A police force with almost 100,000 may not be able to implement these reforms, due to the simple fact that no one can control what they do. Today, state governments have a tough time in reigning in the military police. ""In many ways, the military police just want people to say they are the best, they shouldn't be questioned."" Look at what happened recently in the Federal District. The police acted very aggressively against protesting teachers and the district secretary of security was not informed about it. He asked to change the head of the military police and he ended up resigning. We cannot give ""full cycle"" reforms to a police force that is not controlled by anyone effectively. The military police commit a lot of killings because everyone turns a blind eye to it. For the police top command, everything is fine. Folha recently did a survey showing that 60 percent of respondents don't trust the military police. Instead of the military police wanting to understand this, the general commander wrote a response criticizing Folha and their research. In many ways, the military police just want people to say that they are the best, they shouldn't be questioned. The military police need to understand they belong to society, not to the [police] command. There are many serious and extremely competent people in the military police. There are many people who want to get closer, who want to help improve the police. But military police culture prevents people from thinking independently. It is urgent, fully urgent, for the military policy to stop distancing themselves from society and to begin to embrace society, to respect it and listen to it. In truth, everyone is afraid of the military police and a police force that people do not trust, and everyone is afraid of not having the ""full cycle"" reforms. Many people argue in favor of the ""full cycle"" reforms based on an ideal world, but this is the real world, where the poor and the marginalized are being killed. If you go to a lot of cool parties, there'll be drugs and sex. But will the military police be there? We live in an unjust society in which there is a violent military police pitted against the poor. This police force cannot undergo ""full cycle"" reforms due to the risk that they might make day-to-day life much worse for a lot of people. And why would things get worse? Because knowing that an officer will have to present an incident [before an investigative body outside the military police], that makes them more careful about what they present. If they are presenting before someone within the military police, they can present whatever version they want by manipulating the facts. ""Changes are needed and one of them is to reduce the power of the military police in public security, not increase."" Ponte: Many military police killings are justified by commanders as the result of a ""war"" against criminals. Can this war logic be applied to an analysis of military police killings in Sao Paulo? Rafael Alcadipani : Brazil police kill a lot, and police die a lot, that's a fact. It's the symptom of a public security model that is not working right now. It is not good for society and not good for most officers. So changes are needed and one of them is to reduce the power of the military police in public security, not increase. Municipal guards and civilian police need more investment and more training. In the ideal world, I believe we should have a single police force, but divided by territories. For example, a police force in Jundiai, one in Campinas [different neighborhoods within Sao Paulo] and so on, with a single command for all police internal affairs. Today, the military police dominates the scene and is doing a bad job at meeting the needs of citizens, especially those who are most in need of their help. In most cases, the police must act as a mediator in conflicts. There are only a few situations where the police need to be involved in confrontations. It is urgent to change the paradigm of how the police operate in Brazil. Ponte: What can the state of Sao Paulo do to try and reduce military police killings and also prevent officers from being killed? Rafael Alcadipani : Any police officer engaged in a confrontation that results in a death should be pulled off the streets for six months. The officer should go to do a program every day. [Former Sao Paulo governor Mario] Cobas did that and that's when police became less aggressive. It is urgent to improve wages and working conditions for police officers. Police die because they earn little and need secondary employment. Sao Paulo pays its police very badly. This article was originally published by Ponte.

"Uruguay, Colombia Put Inmates to Work to Fight Organized Crime. In contrast to most of the region, Uruguay's government and at least one prison in Colombia are taking steps to provide more opportunities and rehabilitation to their prison populations in an effort to reduce recidivism rates and combat organized crime. Uruguay's National Office for Former Convicts (Direccion Nacional de Apoyo al Liberado - DINALI), has agreed to create a foundation that will help former inmates find new jobs. The foundation will hire ex-convicts and put them to work in several projects , including dog grooming, car washes and the maintenance of police vehicles. Meanwhile in Colombia, a minimum security agricultural penal colony located in the department of Meta has turned into a model for other prisons across the country. Stretching over 4,200 hectares, the Acacias prison provides its 1,273 inmates the opportunity to take part in several work and education programs. The strategy seems to have paid off. No one has escaped during the past 15 years, and the penitentiary's recidivism rates are the lowest in the country: only 2 percent of the former inmates have been captured for committing another crime once out of prison. While both Uruguayan and Colombian authorities believe that the challenges to facilitate the inmates' reintegration into civilian life remain high , the programs can turn into a vital mechanism to reduce the influence of organized crime in the two countries. With their emphasis on rehabilitation and training, the programs developed in Colombia and Uruguay stand in contrast with the kind of treatment provided to inmates across Latin American prisons. The region's penitentiaries are suffering a severe crisis, in part due to repressive security measures and a lack of rehabilitation in jails. The skyrocketing inmate populations and poor facilities have turned them into prime incubators for organized crime. Studies by InSight Crime illustrate how criminal groups use prisons to fortify themselves on the inside and the outside of jail, to recruit new members and to train them, and to expand their criminal portfolios. Fortunately, other countries are also attempting to implement alternative measures. In Panama, President Juan Carlos Varela's administration implemented a program known as Secure Neighborhoods , (""Barrios Seguros""), designed to offer technical training to gang members. In 2015, El Salvador launched a program dubbed "" Yo Cambio "" (I Change), a combination of vocational training and building a culture of peace geared to reduce violence inside and outside prisons. In order to work, however, these alternative schemes require near constant private-sector backing and participation. A 2011 government-funded gang truce in Belize, which provided job opportunities to an estimated 200 gang members, came to an end after funds ran out, leading to a spike in violence ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Wealthy Fishermen Ran Major Drug Trafficking Rings in Costa Rica. Drug smuggling fishermen in Costa Rica owned large private properties and luxury vehicles -- riches gained from leading ""transportista"" groups, which are becoming increasingly common in the Central American nation. A Nicaragua national nicknamed ""Antorcha"" was arrested July 3 on charges he ran fleets of drug boats along the Pacific coast, CRHoy reported. The 44-year-old man, who was only identified as Sanchez , owned two docks in the port city of Puntarenas, from which the fishing boats loaded with cocaine docked and disembarked. Authorities said that Sanchez, his son and three other men recruited fishermen to transport the drugs. Walter Espinoza, the general director of Costa Rica's investigations department, described the group as ""well-organized"" and said that it had been in operation since 2017, bringing South American cocaine to Costa Rica and then ""re-exporting it"" to Guatemala, Mexico and the United States, La Nacion reported. Sanchez isn't the only fisherman to have recently been found running drugs in Costa Rica. In January, authorities arrested a 36-year-old man identified as Alfaro Bustamante, who owned two large homes and three cars, including a Mercedes Benz and a bulletproof Volkswagen truck. Authorities said Alfaro Bustamante led a ring that moved cocaine along the Atlantic coast in exchange for Jamaican marijuana, which the group then sold in Costa Rica. The arrests of wealthy fishermen indicate that so-called ""transportista"" organizations -- which receive, store and move drugs -- have dropped anchor in Costa Rica. In the last decade, such organizations had largely been based in the Northern Triangle nations of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, where large family clans dominated the smuggling business. Recently, however, smaller groups in Costa Rica have found ways to get into the game. For example, a Costa Rica gang known as Los Morecos controlled the movement of drugs along the country's crucial Atlantic provinces. The gang was independent from any other drug trafficking organization -- a rarity for Costa Rica-based groups. What makes Costa Rica ideal for transportista organizations is its location as a transshipment point. Its Pacific coast provides open water for the movement of go-fast boats and self-propelled semi-submersible vessels loaded with Colombian cocaine. Some 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled to the United States in 2016 was trafficked via the Pacific Ocean, according to the 2018 World Drug Report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Meanwhile, Costa Rica's Atlantic ports are feeding the European cocaine pipeline. Drugs concealed in shipments of produce have disembarked from the port of Limon to Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands. The amount of cocaine seized in Costa Rica has also spiked. Though seizures are not a perfect proxy for drug movements, Costa Rica took in a record 33.6 tons of cocaine in 2018. During a single week in March this year, authorities seized 6.4 tons of cocaine. The largest bust in that stretch came when authorities intercepted a Colombian submarine carrying 1.5 tons of drugs. The following month, another ton of cocaine was discovered aboard a boat disguised as a fishing vessel. It was 80 nautical miles off the coast of Puntarenas, where the drug smuggling fisherman had his docks."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Retired Mexican General Shot After Car Crash. A retired senior army general was shot dead near Mexico City moments after getting out of his car due to a traffic accident. General Jorge Juarez Loera retired earlier this month from the number three spot in the Mexican Army. He headed operations against violence in the north of the country, including in the key drug trafficking state of Chihuahua, until 2008. Dressed in civilian clothing and traveling in a private car, it is not clear yet whether or not the general was specifically targeted, reports the BBC. Federal prosecutors in Mexico say they will investigate the slaying because of suspicions that organized crime is involved. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Peru Arrests Alleged Head of VRAE Cocaine Clan. Peruvian police detained the suspected head of a major drug trafficking clan in the VRAE, the country's biggest cocaine-producing region, drawing attention to the changing tactics of traffickers in the zone. Peru's anti-drug police unit Dirando announced on August 12 that they had detained Luis Amarildo Montero Lopez, suspected of being the leader of a drug trafficking network operating in the Apurimac and Ene River Valley (VRAE). The authorities arrested two others who were travelling in the same truck as Montero, and seized 250 kilos of cocaine hidden beneath a false floor of the truck. The narcotics were reportedly due to be sent to Europe, where they would have fetched around $12.5 million. According to La Republica , Montero was the successor of Jose Manuel Lopez Quispe, alias ""Papitas,"" who was arrested on June 27. Papitas allegedly served as a major supplier of cocaine to Mexican gangs such as the Sinaloa, Juarez and Tijuana Cartels, operating as an "" acopiador ,"" a middle man who purchased coca leaf from local farmers before processing it into coca paste or cocaine hydrochloride (HCI). The head of Dirando, Walter Sanchez, described Montero's capture as ""a blow to international drug trafficking,"" adding, ""the fight against trafficking is relentless. We are intensifying operations along the coast, in the mountains and in the jungle."" Investigative news organization IDL-Reporteros recently released a series of reports on the VRAE's drug trade , identifying the region's biggest players and how their trafficking networks have evolved in recent years. One key trend they identified was the increased use of trucks and other vehicles to traffic cocaine, as opposed to using ""backpackers"" to move it on foot through the VRAE's rugged terrain. The capture of Montero with cocaine hidden in his vehicle supports this observation. However, the report also noted that traffickers were more often moving the drug in its less-refined paste form, preferring to traffic it south to Bolivia for processing. The fact Montero was found with cocaine hydrochloride shows that some traffickers who have international networks still prefer to process it before export. Indeed, Montero's alleged former boss Papitas was detained in June in a house that was being used to produce HCI. This form of the drug can fetch $950-$1100 per kilo compared to $600-$800 for coca paste. Montero's arrest draws attention to the make-up of Peru's drug trafficking organizations. Unlike 20 years ago when Colombian criminal groups such as the Medellin Cartel had a direct stake in coca paste and HCI coming from Peru, the trade is now mostly in the hands of family clans -- some 15 of which are believed to operate in the VRAE alone -- that produce anywhere between 300 and 500 kilos a month, according to IDL-Reporteros. Added to this mix is the Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) guerrilla group, which is estimated to control around 30 percent of the VRAE's cocaine exports. According to IDL-Reporteros, the group charges $50-$60 per kilo for protecting shipments owned by other groups or individuals. The seizure also highlights the importance of the VRAE, which has become Peru's biggest cocaine producing region. Based on the UN Office on Drugs and Crime 's most recent report on Peru coca cultivation, the VRAE (with 19,723 hectares) now accounts for almost one third of the 61,200 hectares of coca cultivated in Peru, producing around 80-90 tons of cocaine a year. In a recent interview with InSight Crime , Soberon added that around one third of the VRAE's cocaine is heading south to markets in Brazil and Argentina, the top two cocaine consumers in Latin America, and that if Peru continues its current drug policies the area of coca in the country could grow to 80,000 hectares by 2016, driven up growing demand in the Southern Cone.

"UN Report Highlights Regional Consequences of Mexicos Drug War. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's (UNODC) latest report on the state of organized crime in Central America and the Caribbean suggests Mexico's drug war is pushing organized crime towards her neighbours. The report, titled "" Transnational Organized Crime in Central America and the Caribbean: A Threat Assessment ,"" (pdf.), released 27 September, provides a comprehensive overview of criminal actors, their smuggling networks and trends in the region. Among the report's key findings was the assertion that cocaine trafficking, and the violence associated with it, are the main crime issues in the region. However, while violence is inextricably linked to drug networks, the problem is rooted in weak governance and rule of law, and the fact that powerful criminal networks compete for power in certain areas. One of the more interesting assertions is that security policies put in place in Mexico since 2006 have unintentionally shifted trafficking networks deeper into Central America. Increased pressure in Mexico has seen Central America's importance as a trafficking corridor for US-bound cocaine increase in the past six years, as the UNODC graph on cocaine seizures illustrates (see below). What's more, Mexican gangs have been ""displaced,"" with a registered presence in Guatemala and Honduras, where they are seeking to gain greater control of trafficking routes and escape pressure in their home country. The case of Mexico's displaced criminal groups and the spread of trafficking activity deeper into Central America reveals that a coordinated international strategy for tackling illicit flows in the region is required ""so that one country's success does not become another's problem."" The problem of violence is by no means solely related to Mexican criminal groups, the report acknowledges. Each of the Northern Triangle countries - El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras - have their own domestic gangs who drive violence levels and make the area one of the most dangerous in the world. To view any of the region's criminal actors as solely cocaine traffickers is a ""fundamental misconception. They are alternative forms of governance."" Given this, simply removing cocaine from the equation will do little to eliminate the gangs and may in fact increase violence in the short term as they fight for other revenue streams, the report argues. The greatest challenge for governments is therefore wresting territorial control back from these criminal actors. In light of endemic weak governance in the worst hit areas, namely the Northern Triangle, this will require significant institution building and a restoration of trust between populations and the state. Statistics published in the report underscore this, showing that all three Northern Triangle populations were more receptive to the idea of military rule than other countries in the region. This displacement of gangs from their home base is known as the ""cockroach effect."" When the light is shone on criminals in one area, they simply move to another. Both the Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel have a strong presence in Guatemala and reports have begun to circulate in the past two years that they are moving into Honduras. Indeed, the presence of Mexican gangs extends much farther than Central America, with cartels estimated to have a foothold in 16 countries in the Western Hemisphere. The international cooperation necessary to combat this spread is already in motion. Following April's Summit of the Americas, leaders unanimously backed the move to create a regional body to combat organized crime which could potentially lay the foundation for greater intelligence sharing between governments and law enforcement agencies. Though UNODC fully admits the report is not intended to make policy recommendations since such work ""would require a dedicated study,"" one topic it fails to address is the idea of alternative policies for combating drug trafficking. Prior to the document's release, the presidents of Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico all called on the United Nations to lead an open discussion on alternative approaches to the current war on drugs, with President Calderon declaring organized crime to be ""one of the greatest threats to democracy in the 21st century,"" reported the Associated Press. Emphasizing the need for institution building and strengthening governance is a vital step towards countering criminal gangs' control in the region, since endemic levels of corruption and impunity continue to provide fertile ground for organized crime. However, this will take an enormous amount of time and the propagation of the existing counternarcotics strategy -- one which Guatemalan President Otto Perez has openly characterized as a ""failure"" -- in the meantime criminal groups will continue to follow the path of least resistance, and that seems to be parts of Central America and the Caribbean."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Assessing the Who, How, Where of the ICE Attack. As more reports surface suggesting that the Zetas criminal syndicate is behind last week's murder of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) special agent Jaime Zapata in San Luis Potosi, InSight takes a closer look at the accusations and the Zetas' activity in that strategic state. It has been more than a week since unidentified gunmen killed Zapata and wounded another U.S. agent in the north-central Mexican state of San Luis Potosi. According to sources consulted by InSight, the agents were attacked while traveling on Highway 57, which connects San Luis Potosi to Mexico City. As InSight has learned, evidence suggests that the ICE agents rolled down the window of their armored SUV, reinforcing the theory that the assailants may have been wearing military uniforms, perhaps causing the agents to believe that they were being stopped at a security checkpoint. A perpetrator stuck an AK-47 in the window, shooting Zapata in the chest and another agent, Victor Avila, in the leg. Other media outlets have reported that the agents were run off the road, and were not held up at a roadblock. Both the New York Times and Mexico's El Universal have reported that the vehicle driven by the agents carried diplomatic license plates and indicated that the officers may have verbally identified themselves as American to their attackers. Still, it remains unclear if the agents were intentionally targeted by gunmen or if they were killed in a carjacking gone very wrong. Despite the apparent lack of motive for the killing, a possible suspect has emerged in the case. Brownsville, Texas' Brownsville Herald reports that it received a communique supposedly from the Gulf Cartel in which the cartel blamed Zapata's death on their rivals, the Zetas. The full communique, available at El Blog del Narco , alleges that the attack was committed by Zeta commander Jesus Rejon Aguilar, alias 'El Mamito.' Although it is common for cartels to wage propaganda wars against each other in the Mexican media, some in the U.S. believe the accusation holds water. As the Wall Street Journal reports, an unnamed U.S. official involved in the investigation believes Rejon could be behind the death. ""El Mamito and all the Zetas are being closely looked at by Mexican authorities, supported by the joint Department of Homeland Security - Department of Justice task force,"" said the official. ""He [Rejon] is very well-known to us. He is in the mix."" If the Zetas are indeed behind the killing, then it could herald a new wave of violence in San Luis de Potosi, a state that has long been considered a relatively safe tourist destination. As Mexican crime analyst Raymundo Riva Palacio writes in El Diario , the state is emerging as a battleground between the Zetas and Gulf Cartel. In just the last two weeks, the police chiefs of three municipalities in the state - Ebano, Tamuin and San Vicente - have been murdered. This is normally a precursor to any full-fledged battle as one rival attempts to ""heat up"" ('calentar') the area prior to entry by eliminating the ruling organization's contacts in the police. Although the Zetas are in control of most of the state, the Gulf Cartel reportedly controls Ciudad Valles, the state's second-largest city. According to Riva, the recent drug-related deaths in the state can be attributed to skirmishes between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel, along with Gulf Cartel's allies in the Sinaloa and Familia cartels. The violence, he argues, is a sign that San Luis Potosi is now, ""Fully infected, along with the rest of the blood-red national landscape."" A quick look at a map reveals why this state has become so important. It is easily accessible from Mexico City and the Caribbean coast and gives organized criminals access to routes pointing north, including through Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo, the Zetas' most important drug trafficking corridor. The Gulf Cartel is already locked in a fierce battle with the Zetas in Monterrey. This battle appears to have made its way south to San Luis Potosi. "	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Guatemalan Officials Identify 54 Drug Trafficking Groups. An investigation by Guatemala 's Interior Ministry has identified over 54 drug trafficking organizations within the country, including independent groups and those working as ""subsidiaries"" for larger transnational organizations. Authorities also investigated the operations of 40 cells of Barrio-18 and 30 cells of Mara Salvatrucha , reported the AFP. The information collected in the investigation allowed the Minister of the Interior, Mauricio Lopez, to present President Otto Perez with a ""crime map"" at a June 11 cabinet meeting. Lopez explained that the criminal groups have been identified according to their areas of operation, threat level, and structure, reported Univision. Some of the 54 groups function as ""branches"" of larger international organizations, while others operate independently. The majority of these drug trafficking groups also engage in criminal activity such as arms and human trafficking, assassination, extortion, carjacking, and/or robbery. It is unclear how, if at all, the ""crime map"" given to President Perez, which was produced using information collected by Guatemala's intelligence agencies over the past year, relates to the map released earlier this week using information from anti-narcotics investigators from the attorney general's office. While the Interior Ministry could not provide more details, such as the exact areas where groups operate or how many members they have, because the investigation is still ongoing, the remarks echo past reports that the more powerful foreign cartels, most notably the Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel , often ""contract"" local groups for their operations within Guatemala. The infighting between these two groups -- and between smaller gangs affiliated with each cartel -- within Guatemala for territorial control is one of the suspected reasons behind Guatemala's recent increase in homicides. In the past there have been indications that the increasingly sophisticated Maras street gangs , such as the 70 mara cells or ""clicas"" identified by the Interior Ministry, may also be working with transnational drug trafficking organizations such as the Zetas, although reports about the maras becoming ""integrated"" into the Zetas have proven unfounded ."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Brazil Indigenous Tribe Under Threat from Drug Traffickers. An isolated indigenous tribe in the Brazilian Amazon is coming under threat from drug traffickers, according to Brazil's National Indian Foundation. According to the head of Brazil's indigenous protection service, known by its acronym FUNAI, the tribe was first threatened in mid-July when drug traffickers from Peru launched an attack in their protected territory. The site is located in the southwest state of Acre, some 15 miles from the Peruvian border and over 200 kilometers from the nearest Brazilian city. After that attack, Brazilian police launched an operation resulting in the August 3 arrest of Joaquim Antonio Custodio Fadista, a Portuguese national whom police believe is a cocaine trafficker, operating along the Brazil-Peru border. On Saturday guards protecting the area discovered a camp , believed to have been used by to drug traffickers. At the camp they found mattresses, cartridge shells and a broken arrow, believed to have been taken from a member of the tribe. The armed gang who attacked the protected area in late July were allegedly attempting to smuggle drugs into Brazil, crossing the territory of the indigenous tribe. Other reports indicate that drug traffickers may have made attempts to clear the area to grow coca, to be used to produce cocaine. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"El Salvadors MS13: We Trust in God and Nayib Bukele. The El Salvador-based online magazine Revista Factum interviewed a Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) leader who spoke on behalf of the gang. The representative reveals that El Salvador's largest gang is looking at the possibility of talks with the government of new President Nayib Bukele. For the first time, the gang speaks about not only reducing homicides, but also eliminating extortion altogether. Yet these ideas remain vague and, as the spokesperson recognizes, would not happen at the onset. The MS13 representative denies the gang negotiated with Bukele when he was mayor of the capital, San Salvador, but accepts they have had agreements with political parties in the past. In June 2018, El Faro published an investigation that determined that there had been negotiations between the MS13 and Bukele envoys. *This story was originally published by Revista Factum and was translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission. See the Spanish original here. The MS13 has been declared a ""terrorist"" structure by El Salvador's Constitutional Court since 2015 and an international criminal organization by the US Treasury Department since 2012. A gang spokesman has not given interviews to the press for 13 months. Factum: How has the MS13 been restructured after the extraordinary measures (a package of hardline security laws which became permanent in August 2018)? MS13: We have never restructured because we have always been united to this day. Neither the authorities nor the government with its plans has been able to divide us. The extraordinary measures have only brought death, diseases, a lack of food and repression to the prison system and have not fixed the problem. Factum: You maintain that you are apolitical, even though you have negotiated with political parties and have shown that you can affect the results of the country's presidential elections. What does the MS13 think of President Nayib Bukele (who took office on June 1)? MS13: We as MS13 hope that this president will make the changes that every young person has always wanted for years. Decent employment, new job opportunities, reintegration of gangs Nayib Bukele is a young president who brings a fresh attitude. The young people have placed their trust in him, for the return of the rights that all Salvadorans have and that the previous government had denied us. Factum: Has the MS13 placed its trust in Nayib Bukele? MS13: We have faith in God and in him, that he can be the president who deals with problems from the root, and with these absurd extraordinary measures, with death squads and by wanting to arm people to kill gang members. That simply causes the deaths of more Salvadorans. Factum: What is that faith based on? You say that no previous president has known how to deal with the problem of violence and the gangs. Why do you believe Bukele can do so? MS13: Nayib is a person who, more than anyone else, has seen the problem from many points of view. He has seen that nothing is achieved with repression and absurd policies. Factum: Does the MS13 have faith in Nayib Bukele despite his leadership of the Grand Alliance for National Unity (Gran Alianza por la Unidad Nacional - GANA) party, which contains members like Guillermo Gallegos, who openly celebrates the extermination of gang members and is calling for the death penalty to be applied to you? MS13: We think, and hopefully we are not wrong, that Nayib has a mind of his own. We have never heard him say he is in favor of the death penalty. Guillermo Gallegos will not be left with anything other than what his president ordered him to do. He doesn't know what he's talking about. The only thing that interests Gallegos is to keep his pockets full. Factum: Politicians deny that they have needed to gain your permission to enter your territory. Why do you now deny that Bukele's municipal government [in San Salvador] needed you to rehabilitate the center of the city? MS13: We need to make something clear: politics is the dirtiest thing that can exist in a country. And the worst thing is that it is necessary. In the past, you said it yourself and people know it, we did have an agreement with certain political parties to improve the country. But governments know that if there are no deaths, there is no money and that happened with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional - FMLN). There were days when no one was dead and everything was fine, but they did not want a country at peace. Factum: Is MS13 ready to seek a solution to the problem of violence with the government of Nayib Bukele? MS13: We, as MS13, would agree to seek peace, whoever the president may be, as long as the human rights of Salvadorans are respected and the president offered sources of employment, reintegration, and many other things, clearly and transparently. We would do our part to be able to live in peace. Factum: You have mentioned the death squads and human rights violations in the prisons, but let's not forget that the MS13 kills, rapes, extorts every day, and has done so for years. Your gang has caused forced displacements. Over the last year, caravans have left with hundreds of people, including children and the elderly, fleeing from you and the threat you pose. What do the MS13 offer? MS13: We have much to offer our Salvadoran people and we have proven this by working hard so that there is peace in our communities. Even if we have to talk to the enemy, everything is done for the welfare of our people. We know that we have done damage to our country and we have asked for forgiveness for that. But we cannot do things well while there is repression from the authorities, from the government. Factum: How can the MS13 tell the women whose sons or husbands were killed, whose daughters were raped, or whose families were forced to leave everything behind that the government should now create more opportunities? MS13: We have caused harm, we know that well and we ask for forgiveness. We have done so, although we know that asking for forgiveness does not solve anything. But what about our beloved National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil - PNC)? How many of our relatives, who have nothing to do with gangs, have been raped, killed, tortured or had evidence fabricated against them? They should also apologize for the wrongs they have done. When we talk about opportunities, we do not just mean they should exist for us, but for everyone, including the people living in rural areas. We are part of the problem and part of the solution. We want to be the solution for our country and to stop the murders. Factum: But you also kill relatives of police officers, of soldiers, people who have nothing to do with the violence. MS13: If that was the case and we did not want peace in El Salvador, many families of police officers would not be there We know that many police families live in our neighborhoods and we respect them. We know that there are good people among the police and that they do their job well, we respect them. But there are others, most of them, that do bad things, like being part of extermination groups. What can someone walking that path expect? That one day, his time will come. Factum: At other times, the MS13 has told the government that it might disband as part of the solution [to the violence]? Do you reiterate that proposal to the government of President Bukele? Are you willing to disband as part of a peace process with the new government? MS13: Look, we have never offered anything of the sort to any government today. But if it meant El Salvador could live in peace, it could be done. We all long for peace and the right to life things that are being denied to us in prisons today. Factum: Is the MS13 ready to sit down and seek a solution to the violence through dialogue with the new government of Nayib Bukele? MS13 : The MS13 is open to dialogue if it is for a better El Salvador at peace and to be able to find a solution to the problems that the country is experiencing. Factum: Is the MS13 willing to negotiate a reduction of extortion with the government of Nayib Bukele? MS13: We are willing to do many things so that we can live better in our country, including a reduction in extortion or to see it disappear entirely. Factum: Extortion constitutes, I would say, 90 percent of the gang's income. To see it disappear would mean a hard blow for the gang. How will the MS13 face that? Do you think that all its members are willing to give up their only source of income? MS13: Look, as long as there are new mechanisms for work and reintegration and as long as the rights of each citizen are not ignored, us gang members can get ahead as working people. Factum: Let's solve this question before moving on to the next topic: giving up extortion, I repeat, is a difficult issue. Especially given that a lot of families of gang members depend on it. How would the gang survive if extortion stopped today, or even if it was only reduced? What would happen to people who refuse to give up their share? MS13: We are clear on this and nobody would oppose that. I repeat, if opportunities were created for all the gang members and civilians little by little the [extortion] fees would be withdrawn. With decent jobs and without discrimination, this could be done. Factum: But you are discussing a scenario which would already be well underway, at a stage where work is being created [for MS13 members]. Do you mean to say that extortion is one of the last things the MS13 would negotiate? MS13: Let me make one thing clear. We are not going to negotiate with anyone. If we could arrange for talks and reach an arrangement for the country to move forward, we will do our part. But not in the conditions that exist today and not with governments of repression and death. Factum: I understand that you would need certain conditions to be met before sitting down to talk. But the government and the people will also expect the same from you: to stop killing, extorting, displacing people. Are you going to take the first step? MS13: If necessary, we would do so, to allow people to see that we are not only about words, but about action, when it comes to securing peace in El Salvador. * This story was originally published by Revista Factum and was translated, edited for clarity, and reprinted with permission.

"Bolivia Seizes 2 Tons of Uranium in Downtown La Paz. Bolivian officials walked back initial claims that two tons of radioactive uranium were seized in La Paz, saying the find contains only traces of the substance; but the discovery renews earlier questions about Bolivia's relationship with Iran and speculations of Hezbollah influence in the area. On August 28, Deputy Interior Minister Jorge Perez said police uncovered two tons of uranium in a garage in an upscale neighborhood near the Brazilian, British, and United States embassies. He called the minerals ""radioactive"" and said they were ""used for building nuclear weapons,"" according to El Tiempo newspaper. Interior Minister Carlos Romero clarified Perez's claims at a press conference later that day, saying the material contained only unconcentrated uranium. The rocks had been moved to the outskirts of La Paz and would be examined by Bolivia's geological survey and the independent Institute for Nuclear Medicine, Romero said. Police arrested four Bolivian nationals as they transferred the material in jute and nylon sacks between vehicles-the result of a six-week investigation, Spanish news agency EFE reported. Officials would not say what groups were behind the alleged uranium transaction, but said the substance likely originate in Brazil or Chile. Bolivia's southwestern Andean region has large reserves of high-grade uranium on a scale comparable to those found in Canada and Australia. This has led to speculation that Bolivia could begin supplying the raw mineral to countries with nuclear plants. In 2009 the Israeli government even claimed that the South American country had begun to supply uranium to Iran for its nuclear program. The two countries did in fact sign a bilateral treaty in 2010 amounting to $1.2 billion in joint ventures, including mineral projects. Additionally, in June Bolivian President Evo Morales met with his Iranian counterpart to sign a new treaty in which Iran agreed to help Bolivia in its fight against drugs by providing military intelligence training and communications equipment. Though there is evidence to suggest that Bolivia has begun extracting uranium, government officials have denied claims they are supplying the raw materials for nuclear weapons to Iran. But some analysts worry that Iran's close ties to Latin American countries like Venezuela, Nicaragua, and now Bolivia, may have paved the way for Hezbollah influence in the area ."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"El Chapos Escape Puts Latin America on Alert. Multiple governments across Latin America have announced security measures in response to the escape of drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, indicative of the Sinaloa Cartel's broad reach in the region. El Chapo escaped from a federal prison for the second time in his criminal career on July 11. His recapture in 2014 was a milestone for Mexican authorities, making his recent getaway all the more embarrassing. The Mexican government has since doubled the bounty on Chapo's head, fired the head of police intelligence, and promised to identify the prison officials involved in the scheme. Meanwhile, international law enforcement organization Interpol issued a red notice for the Sinaloa Cartel leader. Given the extent to which the Sinaloa Cartel runs drug trafficking operations abroad -- which includes a reported presence in Australia and Asia -- other Latin American nations have reacted strongly to Chapo's escape. Guatemalan authorities announced they were reinforcing security along their borders to ensure that Chapo does not take refuge in the country. Honduras committed to a more intense monitoring of private flights crossing their airspace, while El Salvador's police also asserted they had increased vigilance over their frontiers and points of entry. South American nations have issued similar responses. Colombia's anti-narcotics head Ricardo Restrepo Londono told local media that authorities are looking out for increased activity between Mexican and Colombian drug traffickers. Meanwhile, Ecuador's Attorney General's Office confirmed that they have opened an investigation into three companies linked to the Sinaloa Cartel and blacklisted by the US Treasury Department. El Chapo and the Sinaloa Cartel have extensive contacts and resources outside of Mexico, meaning there is a distinct possibility the drug lord may flee abroad. Notably, prior to his first imprisonment, El Chapo fled to Guatemala, where he was captured and extradited to Mexico in 1993. Nevertheless, staying in Mexico may give El Chapo a greater advantage, as he may have better luck corrupting local authorities in what has long been his principle homebase. Latin American nations are doubtlessly hyper-aware of the embarrassment that El Chapo's escape has inflicted on Mexico, and will not want to risk being made to look like fools themselves. But while hunting for a top drug lord makes for good headlines, there are other ways that security agencies across the region can more effectively take action against El Chapo: dismantling the local criminal networks that aid the Sinaloa Cartel."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Ex-Governors Extradition Overshadows Other Important Cases. The extradition to the United States of Tomas Yarrington, a former Mexico governor whose name has become synonymous with corruption and narco politics, could now be imminent. But other recent corruption cases involving powerful, though less high-profile, elites could send bigger shockwaves through Mexico's institutions and criminal networks. The United States formally submitted the documentation for Yarrington's extradition on May 16 to Italian authorities, who arrested the former governor in Florence on April 9, Proceso reported. The request came after some wrangling between the United States and Mexico about where Yarrington would face trial. But US Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Mexican Attorney General Raul Cervantes agreed on April 19 to request that the ""Italian Minister of Justice grant precedence to the United States' [extradition] request,"" according to a joint statement , leaving the charges in Mexico for another day. Prior to his capture, Yarrington had been off the radar for nearly five years. The ex-governor of the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas went underground after the Mexican Attorney General's Office (Procuraduria General de la Republica - PGR) launched an investigation into his links to the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas. He was subsequently indicted in the United States for cooperating with both criminal groups, in addition to being charged with money laundering and receiving bribes. Yarrington also faces money laundering and organized crime charges in Mexico. Throughout his time in office, Yarrington is accused of allowing the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas to establish control over the state of Tamaulipas through initially accepting millions of dollars in bribes to finance political campaigns. He later allegedly became involved with the Gulf Cartel's drug trafficking activities, the accusations say. All the criminal charges against Yarrington relate to his time as governor, from 1999 to 2005, as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional - PRI). The PRI suspended Yarrington in 2012, when the investigation of him in Mexico began. Information that emerged in the Wall Street Journal after Yarrington's capture shows that despite being the subject of an international arrest warrant, he was assigned eight state police bodyguards during the final six months of 2016. The facts around his alleged partner in crime, Fernando Alejandro Cano Martinez, have received scant attention. (Yarrington's comparative fame is the most likely explanation.) But Cano Martinez is technically accused of more offenses than Yarrington, and was actually captured in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, a couple of months before Yarrington was nabbed in Italy. In the United States, Cano Martinez is charged with conspiring to violate the provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, in addition to conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy to defraud, and conspiracy to make false statements to federally insured US banks. In Mexico, he faces multimillion-dollar fraud charges. Despite this, just hours after his arrest, Cano Martinez was released after posting bail and granted an order of protection against any demand for his detention in Mexico by a federal judge. It is unclear how Cano Martinez qualified for bail when he is wanted on such serious charges in the United States and Mexico. However, it is fair to speculate, given his reported connections , that favorable treatment and corruption may have played a part in his release. All this points to further evidence of the long-lasting influence of political and business elites in Mexico, even when they are widely suspected of having abused their power. Yarrington may still have wielded significant influence until the day of his arrest, but the slow speed of the legal action taken by Mexico and the United States promises to weaken the impact of his prosecution. Both he and Cano Martinez were arrested -- and Cano Martinez subsequently released -- more than a decade after their crimes were committed. The PRI has also lost control over Tamaulipas to a rival party for the first time in its history. Francisco Javier Garcia Cabeza de Vaca assumed office in October of 2016 and is a member of the opposition National Action Party (Partido Accion Nacional - PAN). Now, ten years later, and with a new party governing the state, many of the power networks and players have shifted. That fact renders much of the information Yarrington may offer to US law enforcement -- should he choose to cooperate -- rather out of date, according to Jose Antonio Caballero Juarez, a professor at Mexico's Center for Economic Research and Training (Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas - CIDE). ""Surely his [Yarrington's] links can be traced back to people who are still active,"" Caballero told InSight Crime in an email. ""While he may be able to provide information on more recent issues, his impact here seems to be much less important."" Even if Cano Martinez is eventually re-arrested and prosecuted, the same logic applies to any information he may be persuaded to share with law enforcement. In contrast, other recent, high-profile cases of corrupt elites offer hopes for more potential impact in challenging Mexico's institutional corruption and disrupting today's criminal dynamics. In April 2017, Ivan Reyes Arzate, a former commander of a Mexican police unit that shared intelligence with US partners, was charged with ""conspiring with others to corruptly impede a U.S.-based narcotics investigation,"" according to a press release from the US Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Illinois. Reyes ""directly shared information with the targets of a US investigation in an effort to corruptly influence and warn the subjects of the investigation that they were being targeted,"" according to the criminal complaint. In a supposed pattern of collusion that dates back at least as far as 2009, Reyes allegedly ""used his powers as a law enforcement official to protect the Beltran Leyva Organization's interests and regularly received payments totalling millions of dollars."" Reyes had passed confidence tests in both the United States and Mexico, and the case against him shows the limits of such exams, says Caballero. Crucially, Reyes was fired in November 2016, and in February 2017 was confronted by US federal prosecutors and Mexican Federal Police in the US embassy in Mexico City, according to the Chicago Tribune. The criminal complaint against him was promptly filed in February, and the indictment followed in April. Reyes remained active in his alleged criminal collaborations up until the day he was fired, and was arrested soon after. Should Reyes, currently in custody in Chicago, choose to cooperate with law enforcement to lessen his sentence, he promises to shed much more light on contemporary organized crime dynamics and their political connections than Yarrington is likely to be able to do. The case of Edgar Veytia, the ex-attorney general of Mexico's state of Nayarit also has the potential to make a real impact. Veytia was arrested on March 27, in San Diego, California, on drug charges. According to a US federal indictment , between January 2013 and February 2017, Veytia conspired to smuggle at least one kilogram of heroin, at least five kilograms of cocaine, at least a half a kilogram of methamphetamine and at least one metric ton of marijuana into the United States. The allegation that Veytia was actively engaged in colluding with drug traffickers up until a few months ago suggests that he may have the most useful information at his disposal if he is to strike a deal with US authorities. Furthermore, as attorney general, Veytia allegedly started colluding with drug traffickers in 2013, the same year he became Nayarit's top law enforcement official. His state shares a northern border with the state of Sinaloa, the headquarters of the Sinaloa Cartel, which still retains significant control of operations to traffic drugs into the United States. Since the capture and extradition of its former leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman in January 2016, the Sinaloa Cartel has been weakened by an internal power struggle. The Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion - CJNG), which was formed in the states of Jalisco and Colima, has been expanding across the country. Anonymous military sources told Vanguardia in March 2017, that Veytia allowed the CJNG to make Nayarit its center of operations, and offered them protection in the process. Veytia allegedly allowed the CJNG to produce heroin and methamphetamine in clandestine laboratories in Nayarit, and to store cocaine shipments from Central and South America. All this information suggests that Veytia and Reyes, rather than Yarrington or potentially Cano Martinez, could provide the kind of information that law enforcement could actually use to dismantle criminal organizations operating today. This cross comparison shows the importance of timing, and how high-profile cases are not always the ones that can have the biggest impact on the ground. That said, the prosecution of Yarrington still sends a message. Corruption within Mexico's political and security institutions has long plagued the country. In 2016 alone, five former Mexican governors were among a total of 11 ex-governors to face corruption charges -- among them Eugenio Hernandez, another ex-governor of Tamaulipas (from 2005 to 2010 after Yarrington); Rodrigo Medina, governor of Nuevo Leon from 2009 to 2015; and Cesar Duarte, governor of Chihuahua from 2010 to 2016. All were at one time members of the PRI. Yarrington's prosecution -- and that of another ex-governor accused of corruption, Javier Duarte -- could be interpreted in one of two ways. It could signal that corruption in politics will not be tolerated, especially as the PRI focuses on improving its image, which has been ravaged by countless corruption scandals and human rights atrocities under the current administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto. Or it could be a warning to corrupt officials to keep a low profile, at least until after the presidential elections next year. Regardless of what the PRI is doing to try to clean house, it will take a much more systematic institutional overhaul to rid Mexico of the impunity that allows cases of such abuses of power to happen. Meanwhile, the timely arrest and prosecution of allegedly corrupt elites like Veytia and Reyes are much more useful in the dismantling of today's organized criminal networks and their narco-political nexus than those cases focused on corrupt actors long removed from power."	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"New York Indicts Drug Ring Linked to Mexicos Sinaloa Cartel. US prosecutors have brought charges against a drug ring linked to Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel that turned western New York into ""ground zero"" for narcotics trafficking in the state, providing further evidence of the Mexican criminal network's control of the US East Coast heroin trade. US Attorney William J. Hochul for the Western District of New York announced on August 9 the indictment of 17 individuals on federal drug trafficking and money laundering charges. Hochul said the drug ring, referred to as the Gil/Aguirre Drug Trafficking Organization, represented ""the largest drug trafficking organization ever dismantled"" in western New York. He said the group turned the city of Buffalo ""into ground zero for fentanyl/heroin trafficking"" in New York state. Between June 2013 and September 2015, the group is estimated to have distributed more than 2,260 kilograms of cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, and marijuana in western New York. During their investigations, officials seized over $2.5 million worth of illegal drugs, including 52.5 kilograms of cocaine, 17.5 kilograms of heroin, and 8.5 kilograms of fentanyl. The group laundered approximately $20 million in illicit proceeds from western New York to California banks over a one-year period, according to officials. The drug ring allegedly sourced their drugs from Mexico. According to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Special Agent in Charge James Hunt: ""The Sinaloa Cartel's reach from Mexico into US cities is most evident in this investigation."" US officials pinpointed Herman E. Aguirre, a leader of the organization, as the Sinaloa Cartel link, local media reported. The group established front companies in California and western New York, including a fake seafood business, and used them to disguise their trafficking operations. Drugs were concealed in containers labeled ""sea cucumbers"" and sealed with foam or spray insulation to avoid detection. Sea cucumbers are typically used in Chinese cuisine. The tentacles of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel are known to reach deep into the United States, with Chicago in particular serving as an important drug distribution hub for the criminal network. Indeed, the DEA's 2015 drug assessment emphasized the dominance of the US drug market by Mexican groups, with the Sinaloa Cartel appearing ""to be the most active supplier"" of wholesale quantities of illicit drugs. There have also been indications in recent years of the Sinaloa Cartel moving to control the heroin market along the US East Coast -- traditionally dominated by Colombian groups. This case appears to corroborate that trend. Nonetheless, the choice of packaging drugs as sea cucumbers -- which themselves have been trafficked by Mexican groups to Asia , where they can fetch up to $600 per kilo -- is peculiar, and may have been the group's downfall by drawing undue attention. ""Buffalo is a hot dog and chicken wing kind of town, so these money launderers could have picked any product to report to be selling here in western New York,"" said Assistant US Attorney Meghan Tokash. ""But they picked a sea cucumber."""	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
Guatemala Arrests, Charges Local Officials for Embezzlement. Guatemala prosecutors arrested a group of local officials who they say carried out a popular and juicy embezzlement scheme: the illegal attribution of government construction contracts in exchange for kickbacks. Authorities captured 15 individuals on October 25, in Huehuetenango and Totonicapan, two neighboring departments of northwest Guatemala, announced the Attorney General's Office via a press release. Among the arrested suspects are former local officials and employees from several municipalities spanning the two departments. Arrest warrants have been issued for another 11 individuals suspected of integrating the network. This includes Geronimo Martinez, the current mayor of Huehuetenango -- the capital city of the department bearing the same name. Authorities believe that several municipalities repeatedly fixed the attribution process of local government contracts to favor a particular construction company owned by Hector Leonel Castillo Gomez. In return, Gomez allegedly gave everyone, from mayors and municipal treasurers to unionists and municipal employees, kickbacks. Various tricks were used to conceal the scheme. The funds, for instance, were funneled through a non-lucrative association officially meant to carry out the bidding process, but whose function was in reality to serve as a screen between the municipalities and Castillo Gomez. Other construction company owners -- including the current Huehuetenango mayor -- appeared as bidding competitors, but were actually in on the scheme, authorities say. In certain cases, corrupt officials went so far as to tailor a public project so that Castillo Gomez's company would objectively be the best option to hire. The investigation, focused on 2008 and 2009 and carried out with the help of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG), found that Castillo Gomez's construction firm received more than 25 million quetzals (around $3.4 million) from the municipalities during the two-year period that was probed. Reports of local and national government contracts being wrongfully attributed have become so common in Guatemala that they appear to be the norm rather than the exception. The sums involved in local government contracts are considerable given that the works are often carried out in relatively remote areas. Due to this economic reality and thanks to the lack of efficient oversight, the illegal attribution of these contracts is more than just a means of illicit enrichment. It is also a powerful instrument to maintain local political control -- or wrestle it away from someone else, as InSight Crime detailed in an investigation into a construction company owner and alleged drug trafficker who became a mayor. SEE ALSO : Guatemala Mayor 'Tres Kiebres': The Art of Being '3 Times Broken' The same dynamics have also applied at a national level, as evidenced by the rise and fall of the previous administration. The illegal attribution of public contracts under former President Otto Perez Molina did not only serve to fill politicians' pockets. They were also the closing of a transaction that had started in the form of financial contributions to Perez Molina's campaign, which helped the candidate secure power .	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Nicaragua Discreetly Prosecutes Prominent Drug Trafficking Suspect. Authorities in Nicaragua are discreetly prosecuting a major underworld figure from the country's Caribbean coast, highlighting the area's important but often overlooked role in the international cocaine trafficking chain. Amauri Carmona Morelos, also known as Jose Alberto Ruiz Cano and Amaury Paudd, is currently being prosecuted on charges of international drug trafficking, homicide, illegal carrying of weapons, money laundering as well as damages to the Nicaraguan state and members of the military and national police, La Prensa reported on August 27. Captured in February earlier this year, the alleged trafficker is believed to have shipped Colombian cocaine via Colombia's San Andres island to points along Nicaragua's Caribbean Coast. Carmona is also thought to have participated in a deadly 2009 ambush against dozens of security forces with the help of the local community in Nicaragua's remote coastal Walpasiksa area, where Carmona had set up a base of operations. Nicaraguan authorities have provided little information on Carmona's case. As reported by La Prensa in February, his arrest was confirmed by his lawyer several weeks after the event, while police refused to publicly comment on the capture. Based on information from unnamed ""unofficial sources,"" the Nicaraguan news outlet reported that the trafficker may have been arrested in Honduras, where he also operated, and secretly handed over to Nicaraguan authorities without following due process. The secrecy around the prosecution, conducted behind closed doors, only adds to the mystery of this criminal figure, who operated with a national identity card in Nicaragua but was also reported to originate from Colombia, Honduras and even Peru. What is sure is that his links to Colombia's San Andres archipelago are longstanding. In 2000, Carmona was a crew member of a boat on which San Andres police found several kilograms of cocaine. However, he was cleared of all charges related to the incident the following year. The Carmona case is illustrative of the often overlooked but important role played by Nicaragua's Caribbean coast within the international cocaine trafficking chain. As InSight Crime chronicled in a special investigation , the coast has developed major logistical services in support of maritime cocaine shipments heading north. Local capos such as Carmona typically use remote areas with little to no land access to stock drugs and wait out naval operations, and to repair and refuel go-fast boats that traffic the cocaine. SEE ALSO : Nicaragua News and Profiles In addition to its natural characteristics, socioeconomic dynamics have turned Nicaragua's Caribbean coast into fertile ground for trafficking operations. Local impoverished indigenous populations live in areas largely devoid of state presence or services, and certain communities still lack trust in federal authorities, due to conflicts with the government of President Daniel Ortega dating back to the 1980s. This provides an ideal recruitment environment for organized crime groups, allowing them to conduct their operations in the area largely unchallenged."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Bolivia Ideal Place to Sell Peruvian Cocaine: Drug Trafficker. A drug trafficker's description of the economics of selling Peruvian cocaine inside Bolivia may feed speculation over just how much of Bolivia's cocaine is produced inside the country, and how much actually originates from abroad. According to a drug trafficker interviewed by Peruvian newspaper La Republica , purified cocaine paste can be bought for $850 a kilo in Monzon or Tingo Maria in central Peru, just north of the country's drug producing heartland. If the shipment makes it to La Paz, the cocaine can be resold for between $1,600 and $2,000 per kilo. The price of the kilo rises with the amount of risk involved and the length of the journey, according to the trafficker. A transporter charges $50 per kilo for drugs moved to the Peruvian coast, but $300 per kilo for drugs taken to Bolivia. Bolivia is also an attractive destination because the risk of being discovered by Bolivian authorities is low, he added. The majority of shipments taking this route belong to people linked to Mexican cartels, which only deal in quantities larger than one ton and pay $1,400 a kilo, the trafficker said. In addition to being a major producer of coca and cocaine, Bolivia is an important transit nation for Peruvian and Colombian-origin narcotics. There has been some speculation over how much of the cocaine seized inside Bolivia is actually produced abroad -- in 2011, one anti-drug official said that over half of the cocaine shipments seized in Bolivia originated in Peru. The question is whether increased amounts of cocaine are being seized inside Bolivia because internal cocaine production is on the rise ( as the White House has asserted ), or because more traffickers (like the one interviewed by La Republica) are selling Peruvian product on Bolivian ground. Peru and Bolivia recently announced plans to form a binational border police to tackle cross border trafficking. However, with traffickers increasingly relying on drug flights passing through Bolivia to create an ""air bridge"" between Peru and Brazil and Argentina, security forces face a stiff challenge in stemming the flow of drug shipments along this route."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Top Zeta Leader Captured in Oaxaca. Mexican police announced on Tuesday the capture of Flavio Mendez Santiago, alias ""El Amarillo,"" a top leader of the feared Zetas criminal syndicate, in the town of Villa Etla, in the southern state of Oaxaca. Authorities say Santiago is one of the Zetas founders and top leaders, in charge of drug and human trafficking in a region full of both, Mexico's El Universal newspaper reports. The capture comes as the Zetas rev up the violence and mayhem in the region. The Associated Press reports that the group, which began operating independently in 2007 and split from their progenitors the Gulf Cartel last year, has taken over the area along the Guatemalan border and could be responsible for the disappearance of up to 40 illegal immigrants who were traveling through the region on their way north. The Zetas, whose core remains ex-military from Mexico and Guatemala, are known for their violent and intractable positions concerning rivals. They have spread their presence geographically and have expanded their criminal portfolio beyond drug trafficking to include human trafficking, contraband, and pirated goods. The Guatemalan government cited their presence in December when it announced a 30-day state of siege in the Alta Verapaz province in central Guatemala. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Neo-Paramilitary Groups Divvy Up Colombias West. Three of Colombia's most powerful neo-paramilitary criminal bands have reportedly made a non-aggression pact and defined their respective territories in parts of the country's troubled north and west, marking a new chapter for drug trafficking. In early February, leaders of three Colombian criminal gangs (called by the government BACRIMs - ""bandas criminales""), the Rastrojos , the Urabenos and the Paisas -- reportedly met in Medellin to clarify the borders between their areas of control in the country. Colombian daily El Pais interviewed two anonymous sources familiar with the meeting, who said that it was attended by Fernando Varon, alias ""Martin Bala,"" a Rastrojos leader, the Urabenos' "" Mi Sangre ,"" and Julio Cesar Sanchez, alias ""El Politico,"" a leader of the once-powerful Paisas. Sanchez was captured just days after the meeting, in the northern province of Cordoba. The meeting ended with the three agreeing to clarify their zones of influence in the north and west of Colombia. In exchange for allowing the Urabenos to hold onto the Sucre and Choco departments along the Panamanian border, the Rastrojos were granted undisputed hegemony over the departments of Valle del Cauca, Cauca and Narino in the southwestern corner the country. One cell of the beleaguered Paisas, who have taken several hits to their command structure in recent years, was allowed to continue operating in the central northwestern department of Antioquia, although the leaders agreed to keep the majority of the province as disputed territory. Despite the agreement, these groups are still enmeshed in bloody turf wars across the northern region, as InSight Crime's map below illustrates. The Rastrojos and Urabenos are still competing for control in the northern departments of Magdalena, Santander and Guajira, and the Urabenos are still engaged with what is left of the Paisas in a bloody turf war over Cordoba. Colombian authorities have claimed not to have any knowledge of the supposed pact, and would neither confirm nor deny its existence to local media. According to Antioquia police chief Col. Jose Gerardo Acevedo Ossa, the reports of the meeting are being treated as ""rumors"" until officials see or hear evidence to the contrary. Acevedo also told reporters that any pact between authorities is likely to be temporary, and cautioned local media not to put too much stock into the reports. His caution is well-founded. InSight Crime believes that although the three organizations have a clear motive to form a non-aggression pact, there are bound to be points of tension in any agreement. For one thing, it is far from clear that Varon is truly allied with the Rastrojos. In 2005 the Rastrojos' leaders allegedly ordered a hit on Varon, and, although it failed, it is unlikely that the drug boss has forgotten the incident. There have been reports that Varon is currently fighting the Rastrojos. Additionally, last June police investigators reported that Victor Patino Fomeque, alias ""El Quimico,"" a former member of the Cali Cartel, had entered into an alliance with the Urabenos in the Valle del Cauca department. Patino was arrested in 1995 and extradited him to the US, but was returned to Colombia in 2010. It is believed that Patino worked under Varon in his days with the Cali Cartel, and still maintain links to his former boss. If this is true, it would indicate that Varon could be playing a double game, and has less loyalty to the Rastrojos as is currently believed. Another factor that poses a danger to any agreement is the issue of third parties. After the ERPAC agreed to demobilize in late December, their area of control in the eastern plains region represents an attractive source of potential funding for both the Rastrojos and Urabenos. It is currently unclear what is to become of the ERPAC's drug trafficking networks in the east , but if either group takes them over it could give them a financial edge over the other, making them less likely to honor any kind of agreements in other parts of the country. Colombia's rebel groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) and the National Liberation Army ( ELN ) should not be left out of the equation either. Both the Rastrojos and Urabenos are known to have local connections with rebel groups, largely based on the supply of unprocessed coca base. If security forces succeed in taking down either rebel group this year, it could create a significant power vacuum that would put a spoke in the wheel of any kind of inter-BACRIM agreement. A third variable which would affect the prospects of an agreement is the fact that a handful of major players in Colombia's criminal underworld are reportedly negotiating to surrender with US law enforcement. The Colombian government has acknowledged that Luis Enrique and Javier Antonio Calle Serna , the leaders of the Rastrojos, are in the middle of clandestine talks with US officials as a response to increasing pressure from security forces. Intelligence sources have informed InSight Crime that Daniel Barrera Barrera, alias "" El Loco Barrera ,"" is also considering turning himself in, and is similarly negotiating with US officials. If any of the above turn themselves in, it is likely that they will provide a wealth of intelligence to counternarcotics officials about other top drug trafficking figures, friend and foe alike. If this happens, it is unlikely that the Urabenos and Rastrojos will still be motivated to maintain a cease-fire. Ultimately, while the reports over the agreement may be true, it is unlikely to bring any kind of lasting peace to Colombia's embattled north and west departments. Even if none of the problematic factors above cause the agreement to fall apart, the structure of BACRIM groups surely will. Unlike their predecessors in the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia ( AUC ), the second generation of paramilitaries in Colombia lacks a centralized command structure. Talk of large-scale agreements between them is misleading, as the relationships between them generally have more to do with the regional dynamic of the cocaine trade than anything else.

"How a Good Soccer Team Gives Criminals Space to Operate. Local soccer teams give criminal groups in the Northern Triangle countries of Central America the ability to launder proceeds, evade taxes, and accumulate enough political and social capital to avoid scrutiny. These organizations center their criminal operations in small municipalities in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, but they are international traffickers. The soccer teams form part of their vast economic portfolio, and provide them with local support in their areas of operation, which they use to expand their business and political connections and protect their licit and illicit interests. (See response to article of one of the soccer team's sponsors.) Part of this protection comes from the fact that the fortunes of these soccer franchises rise with organized crime at the helm. In Guatemala, for instance, the Heredia Jaguars in the Peten province -- which are owned by the Mendoza clan, an infamous family that has made its fortune via contraband, drug smuggling and government corruption -- have been virtually unbeaten since 2010. In honor of the World Cup, InSight Crime is chronicling how soccer and organized crime intersect. See other stories here. In El Salvador, the Isidro Metapan club, from the municipality of the same name, has won eight titles in the last seven years. Their president, Wilfredo Guerra Umana, is the son of Juan Umana Samayoa, the mayor of Metapan. Their partner, Adan Salazar, alias "" Chepe Diablo ,"" is the head of the Texis Cartel, according to the Security Ministry. And in Honduras, Real Sociedad de Tocoa, from the Colon province, is reportedly owned by the Rivera Maradiaga family, also known as the Cachiros. Honduran and US authorities say the Cachiros are one of the most powerful criminal groups in Honduras, moving cocaine and other illegal substances for larger crime groups from Mexico. The US is pushing the Honduran government to capture and extradite the group's leaders, but if the local soccer fans have any say about this persecution, it may be a hard sell. After climbing to the premier division in 2012, Real Sociedad de Tocoa made it to the championship final two years in a row. The reasons criminal groups buy into local soccer teams are numerous. To begin with, the soccer teams give them a way to launder money. There are few regulations regarding the teams. The owners can invest in whatever infrastructure they want. Plaza Publica reported that the mayor of the municipality of San Juan (in Peten province), Julian Tesucun, spent close to $2 million on the Jaguars' stadium, a small fortune in that part of the world. It is not known how much money the Mendozas put into the construction, but Tesucun baptized it the ""Milton Mendoza Oswaldo Mendoza Matta"" stadium. (Its official name is the ""Julian Tesucun y Tesucun"" stadium.) ""[Mendoza] has contributed to the development of sports in the municipality,"" the municipality's website reported at the time, according to Plaza Publica. The stadium deal helped Tesucun firm up his relationship with the Mendoza family, which Plaza Publica suggests led the Mendoza family to contribute to his political campaign for Congress in 2011. Tesucun won a congressional seat that year. Soccer teams can also falsify contracts with employees and players, investigators say. They can set up ""friendlies"" with other teams for money. They can draw up papers showing earnings that do not exist, since there is so little regulation. And they can evade taxes. In April, Salvadoran authorities charged alleged members of the Texis Cartel for tax evasion. Although the Isidro Metapan club was not mentioned as part of that investigation, La Prensa Grafica raised questions about the owners' ability to make tax-deductible donations to the club. These ""donations"" are made via another cash-heavy business, the rice and granary complex the group manages, and result in an advertisement on the team jerseys (see photo below). (The owners of the club were so angry with La Prensa Grafica's coverage, they did not allow its reporters in the stadium following the publication of the article on tax evasion and the club.) The interconnected nature of these businesses illustrates an important aspect of the money laundering trade: the movement of money between and amongst businesses of the same conglomerate help mask earnings and camouflage illicit activities. Soccer clubs also help forge alliances with legitimate businesses and politicians. In Honduras, Real Sociedad de Tocoa is sponsored by one of the country's preeminent banks, Banco Continental , as well as a popular zoo owned by the Rivera Maradiaga family, which was taken over by the government last year as part of the investigation into the group. The Cachiros also have a mining business, and African Palm and cattle ranches. Like the Mendozas, they intersect with local and national politicians of various political parties, government investigators told InSight Crime. Despite the open connection between organized crime and soccer, there are no investigations into these clubs' finances, the movement of players, or the development of infrastructure. In essence, soccer is untouchable, especially when it relates to a perennial winner. The clubs' success also gives these dubious economic groups power in the municipalities in which they operate. Business and political figures want to be associated with a winner, even if that winner is on the United States' list of extraditables. In honor of the World Cup, InSight Crime is chronicling how soccer and organized crime intersect. See other stories here. Jaime Rosenthal, President of Banco Continental in Honduras, responds: Dear Mr. Dudley: We have read the article you published with the headline ""How a Good Soccer Team Gives Criminals Space to Operate"" in ""In SightCrime"". We believe your publication, besides being incorrect, makes dangerous assertions that are not true. In Honduras football teams are not corporations, they have no stockholders and football teams make no profits, they have losses only. Football or soccer is a passion in our country, people are interested in football (soccer) and in politics but they do not go to the stadiums because people do not have enough money to pay for the entrance. Football teams live on donations from the directors and sponsors ""patrocinio"" from companies that put their logo in the uniforms for advertising purposes. The other important income for the football teams is the TV rights to transmit the games; everybody sees the games on TV. We have a TV Station, Channel 11, and we have grown a lot because we buy the rights to transmit the games of 4 of the 10 teams in the Professional Football League. We also have a Sport Channel, the only one in Honduras. The country does not originate many live programs, except the news and football. Out of the 10 teams in the Professional League, one of them does not transmit the games in TV in order to get the people to go to the stadiums. One of them is transmitted by two other channels in Honduras. One of these is the main TV station in the country, and it has 4 teams. Our TV station has 4 teams also. There is no way we can hide money or laundry money in this business. All the sponsors that put their logo in the uniform are big companies and others since TV stations transmit all the games, putting the logo in the uniform is a very important advertising spot and very cheap because it has a large quantity of viewers. The different teams in the Professional League try to sell their advertising space in the uniform as much as they can because that produces its revenue to pay the players. The good players in Honduras that are now at the World Cup are owned by foreign football clubs such as the Soccer League in the United States, Clubs in Europe or China. This is the first time that somebody has mentioned the possibility that football can be used to laundry money, avoid paying taxes or other illegal activities, most clubs in Honduras are supported by important companies in different businesses whose owners or directors want to promote football and find that advertising on the football uniform is a good business. The different football clubs sell their logo space as many times as they can in different parts of the uniform. We do not choose the other advertisers in the uniforms of any team. We advertise in the following clubs: Marathon, which is our team, Vida in La Ceiba, Real Sociedad in Tocoa and Deportes Savio in Santa Rosa Copan. Certainly your article damages our image and it is causing problems to us. We have been in business in Honduras for more than 100 years. Our business was started by an American Citizen, the Barrett Family from New Orleans, my Father came from Europe and entered the business in 1929, the Barrett's had no children and therefore, we bought the participation and expanded the business into many different areas, we are a conglomerate. We have audited statements for more than 35 years and we can prove the origin of every penny we have. We believe that you should investigate and do your homework before publishing an article that damages the reputation of other people. Very truly yours, Jaime Rosenthal Oliva President Banco Continental, S. A.

"Honduras Uses Security Tax to Send Army to City Streets. The Honduran government launched a second operation to put troops on the streets of its most violent cities, paid for using funds from a newly imposed security tax. On February 8, the government deployed the military in the two cities worst affected by the country's violence, Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. Security Minister Pompeyo Bonilla said that there would be patrols 24 hours a day under ""Operation Libertad,"" which is intended to cut the cities' high crime rate. Some 600 soldiers were deployed in Tegucigalpa, rising to 800 over the weekend, while 400 were sent out in San Pedro Sula, rising to 500 over the weekend, reported La Prensa. Soldiers and police are operating under a combined command for the joint operation. The police, however, remain in charge of security in Tegucigalpa's twin city, Comyaguela. Roadblocks have been set up in other provinces of the country. The chief of the armed forces, Rene Osorio Canales, said that the operation would continue for the rest of the year, while President Lobo explained that it was being paid for by the new security tax, reported Proceso Digital. Despite the operation, 13 people were killed in Honduras' capital over the weekend, according to El Heraldo. This is the second time that the Porfirio Lobo government has deployed troops for domestic security. In November 2011, the armed forces were sent to troubled regions across the country under Operation Relampago (Lightning). The latest operation follows reports that gangs were imposing a curfew on some communities in Comyaguela. The security tax used to pay for the measure was approved in approved in 2011 and has been levied on companies to help fund the country's security forces. However by December 2012, it had only brought in about half the expected revenue -- at some $39 million, according to reports. In January this year, the funds from the security tax were put under the control of the National Defense and Security Council, and thereby under the control of the president. The same month, the government admitted that public security cameras in Tegucigalpa would have to be turned off, as the government could not pay an outstanding debt to the firm that runs them."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Haitians Smuggled into Brazil Via Drug Routes. Brazil's authorities are concerned about the increasing number of refugees from Haiti flooding into the country, traveling over routes more commonly used for drug trafficking. The Haitian immigrants often travel through the Amazon region, guided by ""coyotes"" who charge between two thousand and five thousand dollars, reports Deutsche Welle. The migrants travel through the neighboring Dominican Republic, to Panama, then through Ecuador, Colombia , Peru and Bolivia, crossing into Brazil in Tabatinga, Amazonas state, or Assis Brazil, Acre. Brazil has received more than 1,300 applications for asylum from Haitian nationals since the earthquake which hit the island nation in January 2010. None of these have been accepted, according to the report, as natural disasters do not qualify people for asylum status. "	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexican Soldiers Working with Drug Gangs Face 60 Years Prison. Mexican military personnel who collaborate with organized criminal groups will now face treason charges and up to 60 years imprisonment under an amendment to the Military Justice Code. The Mexican House of Representatives endorsed the proposal made by the Committee of National Defense to increase the maximum punishment for soldiers who commit the crime of ""treason against the armed forces."" The decree will now be sent to the Federal Executive to be signed and later published in the Official Journal of the Federation. Soldiers who provide information to organized crime groups, deliberately obstruct the work of the armed forces or use military resources for the benefit of organized crime groups will be charged with treason and will now face prison sentences of between 15 and 60 years. The new regulations will apply to the Army, Navy and Air Force. The House of Representatives approved the bill to amend the Military Code of Justice with an overwhelming majority; 358 votes in favor, eight against and four abstentions. The Secretary of the National Defense Commission, Bernardo Margarito, said those who threaten peace and harmony in the country are committing treason and deserve to be dealt harsh sentences. With much of Mexico's police forces viewed as ineffective due to penetration from criminal gangs, the administration of President Felipe Calderon has turned to the armed forces to combat organized drug gangs. However, allegations have also been made of corruption within the ranks of the military. "	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Investigation Reveals Workings of Wildlife Traffickers. Authorities in Colombia say they have dismantled the largest wildlife trafficking ring ever discovered in the country, lifting the veil on the shadowy networks behind a lucrative, but widely underreported transnational criminal activity. On July 7, Colombian police announced they had taken down a wildlife trafficking ring known as Los Pajareros (The Birders), which they accused of selling and distributing endangered wildlife across Colombia and internationally. In raids against the network, police arrested eight people and recovered 83 animals, among them parrots, turtles, flamingos, turkeys, toucans, gulls, storks, capybaras, canaries and parakeets. The arrests are the result of a yearlong investigation that began with a tip off that Heriberto Mateus, alias ""El Pajarero,"" was selling endangered species in a market in the city of Girardot, El Espectador reported. After putting Mateus under surveillance, police then traced his suppliers, the brothers Jairo and Jose Luis Algarra Gutierrez, who allegedly headed the gang. According to El Espectador, police believe vendors such as Mateus put in their specific requests with Jairo Gutierrez, who paid locals in rural areas between $10 and $17 to source the animals. The animals were then sedated and transported to farms or private houses that acted as distribution centers before being trafficked on to customers or sales points. The animals were kept at these wildlife warehouses in deplorable conditions, and subjected to cruel treatment such as birds having their feathers dyed to make them more attractive, the police stated. While many of the animals were then sold in Colombia, police say some were also moved on to Ecuador and Mexico. Police sources told El Espectador they believe the animals were trafficked internationally by sedating them and then concealing them on the person of ""mules"" or sending them directly to buyers by mail. Police estimate that 90 percent of the species trafficked by Los Pajareros were endangered and that their operations earned them between $27,000 and $48,000 a month. There are a variety of markets for illegally trafficked Colombian wildlife, both domestic and international. Within the country, there is large demand for turtles and iguanas, which are traditionally consumed over Lent. Internationally, Colombia has become a hub for illegally sourced reptile skins, with Colombian caimans sold on to be turned into clothing and accessories. However, seizures over the years suggest the largest markets, both domestically and internationally, are for birds, reptiles and fish that are sought after as exotic pets. Globally, wildlife trafficking is worth an estimated $19 billion a year, with 350 million plants and animals sold on the black market annually, according to the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. Aside from Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Bolivia and Brazil are also prominent sources of wildlife trafficked around the world, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) ( pdf ). Despite the huge sums of money on offer and the transnational nature of the crime, comparatively little is known about the criminal structures behind wildlife trafficking. And while Colombian police say that so far this year they have carried out 11,300 operations against wildlife trafficking, recovering 8,300 animals and arresting 1,553 people, these impressive sounding figures mask a broader failure to tackle these networks. The capture of Los Pajareros, therefore, is not only an unusually big win for the authorities, but it also offers a rare insight into the workings of these trafficking rings. The details revealed so far show how wildlife traffickers rely on residents in rural areas to source species. Such residents offer local expertise but their services come cheap and they may be unaware of the legal implications of capturing animals or the broader damage they are doing. The case also highlights the wide reach of traffickers' sale and distribution networks, which are essential for matching animals with buyers. According to the police, Los Pajareros maintained ""innumerous contacts"" in the urban centers of Bogota, Cucuta, Villavicencio and rural municipalities in the states of Cundinamarca and Tolima, as well as contacts abroad. In addition, the investigation illustrates the comparatively low tech smuggling techniques used, which rely on mules and standard postal services to transport sedated animals. While these methods have become steadily riskier over the years for drug traffickers, the comparative lack of awareness and resources to tackle wildlife trafficking mean they remain the easiest option for trafficking animals. Police sources talking to El Espectador admitted they were ill-equipped to detect animal trafficking in airports, although said they had begun training sniffer dogs for the purpose. Finally, the case highlights one of the main obstacles to tackling wildlife trafficking -- while the rewards are high the risks are low, even if you get caught. Sentences for wildlife trafficking range from four to nine years in Colombia. Under current sentencing guidelines, people convicted of sentences of five years or less are eligible for alternative penalties such as house arrest, meaning Los Pajareros may not even spend a day in prison, especially if they cut a deal and accept the charges against them."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
New Vigilante Force Rises in Michoacan, Mexico. A second vigilante force has announced its arrival in a rural region of Michoacan, south Mexico, pointing to the government's failure to provide security to the population in the remote area, which is threatened by drug gangs like the Knights Templar. The indigenous community of Urapicho, in Paracho municipality, released a statement declaring that they had taken up arms due to the threat from criminal groups in the area, reported Cambio de Michoacan on October 18. The community has recently suffered a string of kidnappings and disappearances, according to W Radio Mexico. The document contained five points outlining the group's intention to fight insecurity, to preserve their natural resources, and to win recognition as a community police force. A video released by the community (see below) says that they aim to secure their region against outside threats. It also shows masked and armed men guarding makeshift roadblocks into the community, which they say have been in place for the past month. This is the second vigilante force to have sprung up in Michoacan in the past 18 months. The indigenous community in Cheran, some 10 kilometers from Paracho, barricaded their town last year and took up arms against gangs -- such as the Familia Michoacana and their offshoot the Knights Templar (Caballeros Templarios) -- carrying out illegal logging in the area. These cases of vigilantism raise questions about the Mexican government's will and ability to address the security concerns of remote communities. The people of Urapicho called on President Felipe Calderon to secure the area so that they did not have to continue protecting themselves. The government is yet to release a statement on the matter. Taking security into their own hands leaves these populations vulnerable to retaliation from gangs. An August report by Proceso found that 15 people had been murdered in Cheran by gangs, and five have disappeared, since they took up arms.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Montesinos is Gone, But Perus Narco-Political Brokers Continue Tradition. Peru's drug trade was once highly centralized and facilitated by one powerful man: the government's former spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. Montesinos, and his system, are gone, but traffickers still need their political brokers. It has been more than a decade since Montesinos, commonly referred to as President Alberto Fujimori's ""Rasputin,"" received his first sentence in what would grow to be more than 30 convictions for crimes including embezzlement, influence peddling, death squad involvement and bribery. He has also been convicted of orchestrating a 1999 arms deal in which 10,000 assault rifles were sold to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels. Montesinos, the former head of Peru's National Intelligence Service (SIN) has never been convicted of drug trafficking. However, evidence suggests that he played a pivotal role in facilitating the drug trade in the Upper Huallaga Valley -- once the center of Peru's thriving cocaine industry -- charging protection fees from top drug traffickers and even dealing directly with Colombia's most infamous kingpin, Pablo Escobar. He was, in essence, the underworld's broker in Peru, a person who could help ensure that trafficking activities would not be uninterrupted by security and judicial forces in return for some very hefty sums of money. Since Montesinos' -- and Fujimori's -- fall from grace, the face of drug trafficking in Peru has changed dramatically. The geographic area of the drug trade has shifted, the major intermediaries who once supplied the Colombians have fallen, the Mexicans and Brazilians have moved in, and the air bridge that once linked to Colombia has been rerouted east towards Brazil. One thing that has remained constant, though, is that Peru's political system remains riddled with corruption, and there have been numerous accusations of politicians continuing to support drug traffickers. Fujimori's ""Rasputin"" and Peru's Drug Trade Formally speaking, Montesinos was the deputy head of Peru's SIN. But underneath this title, he was much more. ""There is no one who stands toe-to-toe with Montesinos in the Peruvian government, and nothing that the government does on intelligence, enforcement and security issues occurs without his blessing,"" a 1999 cable from the US State Department read. Montesinos relied heavily on bribery to enact his political will and heighten his power (see videos released by IDL-Reporteros ). He had great control over Peru's military and also developed a close working relationship with the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), despite misgivings expressed by the US Embassy in Peru and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Montesinos (pictured shaking hands at a public event) was supported by the CIA -- which reportedly provided him some $10 million in aid during the 1990s -- when he centralized all anti-drug affairs under the SIN. IDL-Reporteros director Gustavo Gorriti told InSight Crime that Montesinos' role in the drug trade was ""mixed."" On the one hand, he was a hero in the war against the Shining Path guerrillas, was credited with taking down major drug traffickers, and eventually imposed an aerial interdiction policy that essentially froze Peru's drug trade. On the other, he has been linked to various drug traffickers. These alleged drug ties stretched back to the 1970s, when Montesinos worked as a lawyer for drug traffickers , including Evaristo Porras Ardila, alias ""Papa Doc,"" a high-ranking member of the Medellin Cartel. According to several major traffickers, Montesinos, during his time in the SIN, essentially dictated the rules of the drug trade. The now-deceased Peruvian-Panamanian leader of drug trafficking organization the Camellos, Boris Foguel y Suengas (pictured), claimed after his capture that Montesinos demanded $300,000 to swipe his slate clean and that he had paid Montesinos $100,000 bribes in order to fly cocaine out of the country in army helicopters. Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, alias ""El Vaticano,"" the principal provider of coca base to the Medellin Cartel from his base in the Amazonian town of Campanilla during the early 1990s, had a similar story. According to Vaticano (pictured in the white shirt below), he was approached by an army captain he called ""Capulina"" in March 1991, who said he had a high-level connection -- presumably Montesinos -- who could act as a guarantor for his business, for a fee. Montesinos allegedly demanded $50,000 a month from Vaticano, in exchange for rights to operate an airstrip , operational advice and alerts on anti-drug operations in the region. He also has claimed the state provided him with all the machinery necessary to build his airstrip. However, in the summer of 1992, Montesinos attempted to double the fee, and Vaticano refused. Within a month, police shut down the Campanilla airstrip, and Vaticano fled to Colombia where he was captured in 1994. A former judge and a former governor both later told Caretas magazine they had seen Montesinos visit Campanilla during that time period. Roberto Escobar, the brother of Colombia's late Medellin Cartel capo Pablo Escobar, said that Montesinos had accepted $1 million for Fujimori's first presidential campaign, had taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for facilitating drug flights out of Peru, and had even visited Pablo at his Napoles ranch in Colombia. ""Fujimori told my brother by telephone that if he became president, he would happily collaborate whatever way he could,"" Escobar claimed in 2000. A Changing Narco Landscape During Montesinos' heyday in the early 1990s, the same amount of coca was cultivated in the Upper Huallaga Valley alone as now is grown in the entire country. The region was, essentially, a ""colony"" of the major Colombian cartels -- first Medellin and later Cali -- according to IDL-Reporteros. Large Peruvian drug ""firms"" (such as Vaticano's) acted as the cartels' suppliers. The cocaine was flown to Colombia, nearly all in its unrefined form known as coca base or paste, on dozens of planes each day. The air bridge was shut down in the late 1990s, however, and the price of coca plummeted. By 2000, an estimated 13,600 hectares of coca was left in the Upper Huallaga region -- less than a quarter of what was produced at the height of Peru's drug trade. Since that time, Peru's drug trafficking landscape has changed dramatically. The Alto Huallaga is no longer the principal production center. That title now goes to the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valley region (VRAEM), further to the south (see FONCODES map ). And the Colombians are no longer the principal buyers. Now groups like Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel or Brazil's First Capital Command (PCC) are purchasing cocaine and coca paste from the Peruvians. In one recent example, authorities in Peru made the country's largest cocaine seizure ever, more than seven tons, in the port town of Trujillo, encapsulated in a load of coal. It belonged to the Sinaloa Cartel , according to officials. These criminal groups contract Peruvian intermediaries, who gather coca paste and cocaine from the various local drug clans. The intermediaries work for various buyers rather than being exclusive to any one cartel, and there are no known major figures, former Peruvian Interior Minister and security analyst Fernando Rospigliosi told InSight Crime. Nor are there large Peruvian syndicates as there were in the early 1990s. ""The Peruvians are the collectors [of the cocaine and coca paste], nothing more, because they do not handle relationships with the exterior,"" Rospigliosi said. There are also Peruvian custodians. There is evidence, for example, that what is left of the Shining Path guerrilla group operating in the VRAEM protect drug operations for a fee. What this means in practice is that the group will ensure that others do no encroach on the territory of their clients and reduce the possibility of theft of their merchandise. According to Gorriti, the Mexicans are present mainly as buyers. Unlike the Colombians, they do not generally operate in coca regions or get involved in other parts of the Peruvian drug chain. ""They already know from prior transactions who the intermediaries are, who will supply them with drugs from the rural areas, and what the sales price for the drugs are,"" said Gorriti. ""They don't take risks, and they don't intervene in problems of local transport; others take care of that."" For their part, the Brazilians are taking advantage of a shift in demand. In the past couple of years, the Peruvian air bridge has reemerged, but this time directed largely to the Brazilian market (and the Argentine market to a lesser extent). An intelligence agent who asked not to be identified told Peruvian daily Gestion that Brazil's PCC is now the top buyer of Peruvian cocaine. However, according to Gorriti, Peruvian clans are still the ones transporting the drugs in-country, and the Brazilians have very little presence in Peru. For its part, Bolivia is used as a stopping point on this eastern bound route but could also be a point of cocaine production. Precursor chemicals are cheaper there than in Peru, and Gorriti said the Peruvians are moving coca base -- the gooey paste that is the first step towards production of cocaine -- to Bolivia where it is converted to cocaine in more sophisticated labs. A New Political Drug Broker? Peru's security forces only seize around seven percent of cocaine produced in the country. Security analyst Ruben Vargas says this is because of corruption. ""The Mexican cartels, as the Colombian capo Pablo Escobar in his time, use bribery as the principal mechanism by which they are successful in their business,"" Vargas said. ""Now, just as before, narco-corruption continues to perform excellent work: it buys judges, prosecutors, police, armed forces, customs agents, heads of commercial banks and the terrorist faction [Shining Path] that operates in the VRAEM."" Rospigliosi and Gorriti have no doubt that politicians continue to operate as brokers for drug traffickers. However, along with the nature of Peru's drug trade, the form of this collaboration has changed since Montesinos' time. As Peru's drug trade has become more disperse, so has the political collaboration it receives. There is no longer any known political figure with the concentration of power Montesinos once had. Instead, there are a larger number of political brokers that assist drug traffickers in smaller ways. ""They [the political actors today] have less importance, more fear, and additionally, there has been a decentralization,"" Gorriti explained. He said the majority of political collaborators of drug traffickers are now seen at a regional and provincial level, and their involvement is limited: ""There's nobody even close to the figure of Montesinos,"" he added. This widespread, low-level support was highlighted by Peru's recent local and regional elections, in which the country's top anti-drug attorney said as many as 700 candidates may have had drug ties. The case of the multi-ton cocaine shipment in Trujillo is also indicative of this modern narco-political relationship. Congressman Jose Leon rented a property to Rodrigo Torres, alias ""Lic,"" one of the alleged Mexican traffickers in charge of the shipment. Videos were later leaked (see below) that showed him meeting with this same man. Leon has also admitted he once held a ""professional"" relationship with Manuel Sanchez Paredes, who is investigated for money laundering , and whose predecessors in the Sanchez Paredes clan were involved directly in cocaine production and trafficking. He is also believed to have ties to a candidate in the recent elections linked to the VRAEM drug trade. Peru's former top immigration official has also been questioned about the case, given that a residential work visa for Torres was processed in just three days ; it normally takes a minimum of 45. However, Gorriti said the involvement of these characters was likely limited to accepting bribes. Rather than playing a central role, they were looking to make money in one-time deals. There are some other illustrative examples. The mayor of the VRAEM town of Pichari -- described by Salvadoran publication Contrapunto as the current ""heart"" of coca production -- is reportedly the cousin of a famous drug trafficker from the region. The former governor of Ancash, Cesar Alvarez Aguilar, has been investigated for running a ""criminal mafia"" and charging drug traffickers to use the Chimbote port for shipments, with the help of Police Major Jose Luis Carmen Ramos -- nicknamed ""Vladimirito."" Peruvian Congressman Heriberto Benitez Rivas has been linked both to Alvarez and to a criminal network allegedly run by a prominent businessman, Rodolfo Orellana, and a retired police coronel, Benedicto Jimenez. The network is believed to have laundered large quantities of drug money , and Orellana has been accused of ties to drug traffickers in Mexico, Colombia, and Italy. According to both Rospigliosi and Gorriti, some members of Peru's Armed Forces also allow traffickers fly drugs out of the VRAEM for a fee. The difference, as it is for the politicians, is that this system is no longer run by a central figure like Montesinos."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Rising Dragon? The Chinese Mafia Threat in Latin America. Chinese mafia operations in Latin America are little understood, but a recent report on these groups in Argentina illustrates how they make their presence felt via extortion, human smuggling rings, and the occasional murder. As China deepens its economic relationship with Latin America, it's possible these mafias may become ever more prominent. Authorities in Argentina have attributed 31 murders over the last five years, and four in 2014 alone, to seven Chinese mafias operating in the country, reported La Nacion. These mafias reportedly earn revenue by extorting businesses within the Chinese community, and resort to violence when owners do not comply with their demands. In at least three of the 2014 cases, the victim did not appear to have been robbed, leading authorities to believe they were killed after running afoul of criminal groups in the Chinese community. According to La Nacion, the Chinese mafias (also known throughout Latin America under the umbrella term Red Dragon) often hire Argentine nationals to commit the murders. The most recent Chinese victim -- who was shot and killed in Buenos Aires in August -- was found carrying a large sum of US and Argentine currency at the time of his death, and was under investigation by police for human trafficking. Red Dragon Touts Diverse Criminal Portfolio As exemplified in Argentina, extortion is one of the most common sources of revenue for Chinese mafias in Latin America. In one typical strategy, mafias will send Chinese business owners letters in their native dialect, demanding money in return for ""protection"" services. A 2011 investigation in San Martin, Argentina, revealed that one Chinese criminal group required local owners who had paid a protection fee of $50,000 to hang a drawing of a Chinese dragon over their door as a sign that they had paid their dues. Chinese mafia activity in Latin America isn't limited to the extortion of businesses. These small-scale extortion operations are generally run by loosely affiliated groups, while larger gangs run more complex illicit enterprises such as human smuggling rings, which can bring in much higher profits. Human smuggling is an especially lucrative business for Chinese mafias in Argentina and beyond, as Latin America is an important transit point for Chinese nationals seeking to enter the United States without visas. Chinese mafias reportedly charge up to $ 60,000 per person and can potentially earn as much as $ 750 million per year bringing Chinese immigrants to countries along Latin America's Pacific coast, including Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. Once in Latin America, many Chinese continue their journey north using overland routes, traveling through Central America and Mexico before entering the United States. The more sophisticated Chinese criminal groups are also involved in drug trafficking, with cases involving Chinese gangs that have moved cocaine and synthetic drugs from Peru and Panama to Europe and Asia. There are also reports of Chinese mafias in Mexico trafficking precursor chemicals used in methamphetamine production. A Growing Threat? Although Chinese organized crime groups have attracted the attention of authorities in Latin America since at least the 1990s , they have historically been able to stay below the radar of law enforcement officials. Language barriers among Latin American police forces -- as well as the fear of retribution that has prevented many in Chinese communities from reporting abuses -- have kept Chinese mafias largely in the shadows, giving them near total impunity to carry out criminal activities in the region. According to Evan Ellis, a research professor of Latin American Studies at the US Army War College, the development of Chinese organized crime in Latin America is a natural by-product of the increased human and commercial interactions between the two regions. Given the impressive 20-fold increase in trade between China and Latin America since 2000, it would hardly be surprising if Chinese organized crime had grown as well. Drug trafficking, human smuggling, and contraband smuggling are all facilitated by this increased trade. ""Without the high volume of barrels and containers traveling across the Pacific carrying legal goods between the two regions, it would be difficult to conceal contraband and illicit drug materials such as precursor chemicals,"" Ellis told InSight Crime. With China's plans to continue deepening commercial ties with Latin America, it's possible that the increased flow of goods and people could present more opportunities for Chinese mafias to expand their operations. However, there are also signs that Latin American authorities are focusing greater attention on Chinese mafias. In 2013, concern among high-level Chinese government officials over the safety of Jamaica's Chinese population spurred the creation of new security measures meant to fight Chinese organized crime on the island. Meanwhile, police in Argentina have developed an information sharing system with law enforcement in China to better investigate crimes involving Chinese mafias, according to La Nacion. The lack of reliable empirical data on Chinese communities in Latin America makes it difficult to fully understand the scope of Chinese organized crime in the region. Although the Overseas Community Affairs Council in Taiwan releases official data on Chinese nationals living outside of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan ( pdf ), illegal immigration makes it difficult for Latin American authorities to release accurate estimates of the actual size of their Chinese communities. ""There are a large number of Chinese immigrants entering Latin America, both legally and without visas,"" Ellis told InSight Crime. ""Police officials in countries I visited, such as Suriname, didn't know the size of their Chinese population, and they had very little idea of what criminal structures existed within these communities."" While it remains to be seen if new security strategies can neutralize the threat of Chinese mafias as commercial transactions increase between the two regions, stronger data on Chinese migration patterns and criminal organizations would undoubtedly support efforts by local authorities to limit these groups' presence in Latin America."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"US Targets Bank in Mexico Money Laundering Crackdown. In a move that may prove key in the fight against organized crime, the U.S. Justice Department is reportedly working to prosecute HSBC bankers for allegedly laundering Mexican drug money. The Justice Department investigation, still at the beginning stages, hopes to build cases against individual bankers at HSBC. ""Prosecuting individuals is their number one priority,"" a source close to the investigation told Reuters. HSBC first came under scrutiny in August 2010, when the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) criticized the bank for ""highly suspicious activity"" that could allow the unreported movement of dirty money. HSBC agreed to improve its procedures, and has not yet been issued with a fine. Some reports have suggested that HSBC could face a record $500 million fine, suggesting that the Justice Department is determined to make an example of the bank. U.S. authorities have faced heavy criticism for failing to crack down on the laundering of dirty money through the banking system. Mexico's drug trafficking gangs may launder up to $36 billion through its northern neighbor each year, according to some estimates. The ability to move dirty money, undetected, through U.S. banks continues to fuel Mexico's conflict, allowing drug gangs to collect their profits. But negligent banks rarely receive more than a rap on the knuckles: they often need only pay a relatively painless fine and agree to revamp their practices. The most well known example of this lax treatment is Wachovia. The bank has been accused of ""serious and systematic"" violations of banking regulations, which allowed a sum of $420 billion to pass through its accounts unmonitored. It was found to have laundered funds for the Sinaloa Cartel , one of Mexico's biggest drug trafficking organizations, which were used in a number of cases to buy planes which smuggled drugs. Prosecutors accused the bank of ""willfully failing"" to implement anti-money laundering procedures between 2003 and 2008. Wachovia -- later taken over by Wells Fargo -- managed to avoid prosecution altogether by paying a total of $160 million to U.S. authorities. No charges were brought against individual bankers, and the government agreed to defer prosecution of the bank itself. These charges were dropped altogether once Wachovia showed it had implemented the required reforms. The sum was made up of $110 million in forfeitures, to compensate for the $110 million the bank admitted that traffickers had laundered through its accounts, added to a $50 million fine -- a paltry sum relative to the bank's earnings. A report on the case by British newspaper The Observer points out that the total fine paid was under two percent of the bank's 2009 profits, which came to $12.3 billion. Such measures offer banks little financial incentive not to deal with dirty money. At the heart of the money laundering investigations are Mexico's ""casas de cambio,"" exchange houses which are often used by Mexican criminal groups to launder funds. One common practice is for drug trafficking organizations to smuggle large amounts of hard currency, collected from U.S. sales, back over the Mexican border, then deposit it into these exchange houses. The funds are then wired by these institutions into U.S. bank accounts. In the case of Wachovia, one exchange house, Casa de Cambio Puebla, used these funds to purchase a number of airplanes on behalf of the Sinaloa Cartel. After the probe into Wachovia began, Puebla simply shifted its accounts to HSBC , according to Mexican prosecutors. Puebla was headed by Pedro Alfonso Alatorre Damy, who is accused of handling the finances of the Sinaloa Cartel. The use of U.S. banks to launder criminal proceeds goes back many years. Citibank was censured by the Senate in 1999 for failing to stop money laundering by individuals allegedly including Raul Salinas, brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas, who was accused of links to drug gangs. Other banks accused of laundering Mexican drug money include American Express Bank, which paid $32 million in 1994 to avoid prosecution for charges that it laundered money for the Gulf Cartel. Two of its employees were convicted in connection to the case. The bank made a similar agreement with U.S. authorities in 2007, paying a $55 million fine and avoiding criminal charges over alleged money laundering. Just as Mexican cartels can use their drug profits to corrupt and intimidate government officials and members of the security forces in Mexico, they can also persuade U.S. banks to look the other way as they process dirty money. One of the most important things the U.S. can do to help stop the violence erupting below its southern border is to tighten regulations and make sure violators face proper sanctions. Mexico's then-Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora said in 2007 that U.S. efforts to counter money laundering by Mexican cartels, and stop the trafficking of weapons south, were more important than the $1.4 billion provided to his country through the Merida Initiative. Most funds allocated to this U.S.-funded program are targeted at boosting Mexico's law enforcement efforts through technology and equipment, with few measures aimed specifically at the issue of money laundering. The Justice Department's reported determination to prosecute individuals who handle Mexican drug money could be a good step forward. "	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Guatemala Dismantles Ring of Police Moonlighting as Hitmen. A series of arrests in Guatemala has brought down a criminal group made up of police officers working as drug dealers and hitmen, showing how the country has not been spared from the growing crisis of police criminality across the region. The network, known as ""Los Patrones,"" operated across southern and western Guatemala, and was supported by local policemen. ""Each [member] controlled their own drug distribution point, while the police agents facilitated the transportation of the illicit substances in exchange for economic benefit,"" read a statement by the Attorney General's Office. Among the 15 group members captured in Saturday's operation were the group's leaders, Miguel Antonio Solan Solis and Sonia Haydee Lainez Aguilar de Salan, a married couple known as ""El Patron"" and ""La Patrona."" Donil Vinicio Orozco Lopez, alias ""El Mas Chingon"" (""The Most Awesome""), who headed up the group's network of police collaborators, was also arrested. Some 300 members of the National Civilian Police (Policia Nacional Civil - PNC) participated in the operation, which included 30 raids in the departments of Guatemala, San Marcos, Huehuetenango and Escuintla. The dismantling of Los Patrones is the latest operation to reveal the extent of police collaboration with criminal networks in Guatemala. In August 2018, eight policemen were arrested for participation in the "" Comando Silencioso "" network, which carried out illegal raids in order to steal cash and valuables. The network was associated with the criminal group "" Los Marrocos ,"" which had previously recruited police officers to seize and resell drug shipments. The alarming incidence of police criminality in Guatemala reflects structural failures within the PNC that appear to have worsened over the last year. Low pay and a lack of opportunities for professional advancement make it ever more tempting for officers to supplement their earnings with criminal activities, a problem exacerbated by corruption and cronyism within the PNC. In January, a report by the Coalition for Citizen Security and the Centre for National Economic Research revealed that, of 167 police promotions in the period between January and August 2018, 81 percent showed irregularities. Trends in security policy are compounding the phenomenon. A 2018 report by the Guatemalan Studies Center warned that increasing militarization of public security, particularly since the arrival of Enrique Degenhart as Interior Minister in February 2018, risked further devaluing the PNC and harming the professionalization of the police force. The problem of police collaboration with organized crime is far from unique to Guatemala. Parallel examples across the region include Brazil's Escritorio do Crime (Office of Crime), a militia group comprised largely of current and former members of the security forces. In Mexico, the phenomenon has reached epidemic proportions, with 2018 witnessing the decommissioning of entire police forces in Tehuacan and Acapulco due to alleged links with drug trafficking. The structural factors driving police criminality bear striking similarities across the region, which varying attempts at police reform have failed to resolve. The case of Los Patrones demonstrates that the struggle to build strong, trustworthy police forces remains one of Latin America's most intractable security problems."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
El Salvador Tracking Program Reveals Most Arms Come From US. A program to track El Salvador's hundreds of thousands of firearms has established that most come from the United States, suggesting civil war era weapons are being replaced through new arms trafficking networks. With training from the US Office on Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), El Salvador's National Police (PNC) has tracked around 34,000 arms in the last two years, reported La Prensa Grafica. The aim is ultimately to track all legal registered arms, which the PNC estimate to number around 200,000. The process has shown most El Salvador arms come from the United States, said the director of the PNC's Arms and Explosives Division, Eduardo Azucena Lopez. However, some weapons in circulation are left over from the civil war in El Salvador (1979-92) and those of neighboring countries such as Guatemala and Nicaragua. Despite the advances in tracking weapons, various known arms caches have not been analyzed, said Azucena. More than 30,000 arms remain in arsenals seized some years ago but not destroyed, due to legal rulings. The Armed Forces have scheduled the destruction of 1,722 seized weapons for December 5. El Salvador has historically been one of the most violent countries in Latin America, and at least 70 percent of murders are carried out with firearms. While it only takes a small number of weapons to carry out a large number of murders , finding out where the weapons that arm the country's gang members come from is a crucial part of tackling El Salvador's violence. Decades of civil conflict in Central America left the region awash with weapons, which became a major source of arms for emerging criminal groups. Governments have failed, or been unable, to destroy many of these weapons -- not only in El Salvador but also in in Guatemala. Many of the weapons left over from past civil conflicts that have made their way into criminal hands were also originally supplied by the United States , in clandestine shipments during the 1980s. The ATF is instrumental in assisting regional governments that lack the capacity to track and destroy weapons, and its investigations have revealed a high percentage of modern weapons in the region's most violent countries originate in the United States, suggesting as more civil war era weapons are decommissioned, many will be replaced by arms trafficking networks from north of the border.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Mexico: $500M Seized from Organized Crime. Mexico 's government has said that a total of $502 million in cash has been seized from organized criminal groups during the Calderon administration. The announcement follows a report some days previously that the Secretariat of Public Security (SSP) had seized $266 million from organized crime in this period. The new figure, almost twice as high, seems to include cash seized by the army and navy as well as by the police. The reported amount far surpasses that recovered during previous administrations , representing a figure nine times greater than that achieved during the administration of Ernesto Zedillo, and over 10 times that of the figure seized during the the administration of Vicente Fox. Mexico's Deputy Attorney General for Special Investigations on Organized Crime (SIEDO), Patricia Bugarin Gutierrez, who announced the figures , told a meeting of senators, congressmen, academics and human rights advocates that the efforts of Mexico's security forces were dealing a financial blow to those involved in organized crime. While the figures may sound impressive, as InSight Crime has previously reported , they represent only a small fraction of the $39 billion in illicit cash which is thought to enter Mexico annually from the drug trade. 	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"UN Report Slams Moves Toward Drug Legalization. The United Nations has attacked moves towards liberalizing drug laws in its annual narcotics control report, arguing such measures would have grave social and economic costs without significantly undermining organized crime. In the latest International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) report , the UN strongly condemned measures legalizing marijuana and attacked the arguments put forward by advocates for drug law reform. The board argues that legalizing drugs will not significantly impact the revenues of organized crime groups, as such organizations have demonstrated a capacity to make money off legal products such as black market cigarettes. It also stated that the cost savings of no longer enforcing drug laws would not be significant as an increase in drug use would lead to more social problems requiring the intervention of law enforcement, giving as an example the fact that millions of people a year are arrested for alcohol related crimes. The report also claims that the economic costs of healthcare related to drug use and the costs of regulating the industry may outweigh savings in other areas and income from tax revenues. The board particularly criticized moves in the United States and Uruguay to legalize marijuana, with President Raymond Yans calling it ""a grave danger to public health and well-being."" In the report, it cites ""emerging data"" from Colorado, which shows that since the introduction of a medical marijuana program, car accidents involving marijuana, teenagers seeking treatment for marijuana, and people testing positive for marijuana on drug tests have all increased. Some of the arguments offered by the INCB stand as a warning to those that argue for drug legalization as a ""magic bullet"" solution to issues caused by drugs and the drug trade. However, this does not mean they successfully dismantle the case for legalization. For example, it is undoubtedly true that legalizing the drug trade will not make organized crime disappear, as criminal organizations have long demonstrated an ability to adapt and diversify revenue streams. However, by removing their main source of income, the stranglehold of these groups on certain countries will be loosened and their power to corrupt through their vast wealth would be seriously undermined. Other arguments made by the board are far more debatable. For example, the cost of alcohol related policing is directly related to the effects of alcohol and to argue that abuse of completely different drugs would cause similar types of crime is highly dubious. It also seems a false comparison to claim the increase in costs of policing drug abuse would cancel out the savings from ending efforts to tackle drug trafficking, as it is comparing local, street level policing to transnational, high-tech, billion dollar interdiction efforts."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
How Peru Beat Colombia to Be Worlds Biggest Cocaine Producer. The U.S. government says that Peru has, for the first time in nearly two decades, taken Colombia's place as the world's largest producer of cocaine. Assistant Intelligence Chief for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Rodney Benson, revealed that Peru's cocaine industry, which was the world's largest in the late 1980s and early 1990s, is again the leading producer of pure cocaine. Testifying before a Senate committee in early October (see pdf version here ), Benson discussed how Colombia anti-narcotics progress and the fluid nature of the drug trade has affected Peru. In 2010, Peru had an estimated 53,000 hectares of coca under cultivation, compared to 100,000 hectares in Colombia. However, higher-yielding mature coca fields enabled Peru to potentially produce 325 metric tons of pure cocaine, compared to only 270 metric tons in Colombia. This represents a 44% increase from 2009 and the highest production levels since 1995. The reasons for this shift are multiple. For many years, Colombia led its Andean neighbors in both tons of pure cocaine produced as well as hectares dedicated to coca cultivation. Although the effectiveness of eradication policies in regards to reducing quantities of coca cultivated is debatable, aerial crop spraying and manual eradication efforts have forced Colombian coca growers to replace productive, mature crops with new coca plants that typically yield less cocaine per leaf. This partially explains why Peru, despite consistently lower levels of cultivation (as measured in hectares), is now producing more pure cocaine than Colombia. At the same time, five years of U.S. funds poured into Colombian law enforcement has caused drug trafficking operations to balloon into other countries in the region, including Peru. Its less aggressive anti-narcotics operations, and weaker security forces, provide a more hospitable environment for traffickers. The southward shift of cocaine production from Colombia to Peru coincided with burgeoning demand in European and other markets. Europe's cocaine market is estimated to be worth approximately $33 billion dollars annually and rivals the North American market in size, according to the latest UN World Drug Report (pdf here ). Markets in Asia and Australia, while smaller, still generate significant revenues for traffickers because cocaine prices are significantly higher in these areas. Peruvian cocaine is trafficked via Pacific maritime and overland routes , passing through Bolivia before reaching Brazil or Argentina, where a growing drug processing industry turns raw coca paste from Peru into cocaine powder, before it is shipped to European markets. Not all of Peru's cocaine, however, is destined to leave the markets. The UN estimates that South America's 7.5 million users account for about 19 percent of global cocaine consumption. Cocaine consumption is now more prevalent in Argentina than in the U.S., and drug use in Chile rivals that of Argentina. A number of factors complicate efforts in to fight cocaine production in Peru. The DEA witness testified that approximately 45 percent of Peru's total coca cultivation takes place in areas controlled by the Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso). Rebels from Shining Path provide protection for coca farmers during cultivation, using violence and intimidation to deter government-sponsored eradication efforts. As international drug trafficking organizations expanded their presence in Peru, according to testimony before the Senate committee, they have colluded with Shining Path to move cocaine from cultivation centers to key transshipment points along the country's coastline and near the land border with Bolivia. Furthermore, Peru's relatively weak law enforcement bodies are ill-equipped to handle the threat of well-armed and organized transnational drug trafficking groups working in alliance with Peru's homegrown insurgency. Peru's unfortunate history of drug-related corruption in the security forces is reinforced by more recent scandals, like when 18 members of Peru's special anti-narcotics police force were caught transporting cocaine between stash houses. While current President Humala is implementing reforms to purge corrupt and inefficient officers from the force, nearly half of Peruvians surveyed in 2010 said they distrusted the country's police. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Ecuador Tackles Loan Sharking that Funds Human Smuggling. Ecuador has increased the legal penalties for loan sharks in an attempt to crack down on the exploitation that is a key part of the human smuggling and trafficking chain. Unscrupulous lenders who charge more than the legal amount of interest will now face jail sentences of five to seven years and fines of up to 200 times the minimum wage ($318 a month), compared to the current punishments of six months to two years in jail and fines between $16 and $311 dollars, reported El Comercio. Those who lend money to five or more people will face even stiffer penalties -- between seven and ten years in jail and fines of up to 500 times the minimum wage. In one illustrative case, the newspaper spoke to a 67-year-old woman who had borrowed $16,000 from a loan shark to pay for her daughter's passage to the United States in 2008, money that was paid directly to a ""coyote"" -- criminals who coordinate the transport of illegal immigrants traveling across Latin America towards and over the US border. The woman, who was illiterate, signed documents offering her house as collateral. Despite paying back $1,000 a month the debt -- for which the interest increased by 3 percent each month -- rose to more than $40,000 and her house is now set to be repossessed on December 20. Between January 2012 and July 2013, 396 cases of usury (lending money with excessive interest rates) were reported across Ecuador, according to figures from the Prosecutor General. The increased penalties are part of Ecuador's new Penal Code, the majority of which was approved earlier this month. Exorbitant, unethical debt is the bedrock of human smuggling and human trafficking, the key to what makes it such a hugely profitable criminal enterprise. At the beginning of the chain desperate people borrow money to pay excessive transport fees for themselves or relatives. Along the way migrants are often held captive until further amounts are paid, with deadly consequences for those unable to scrape together the cash. Once in the United States, many migrants are then sold into forms of debt bondage such as forced labor or prostitution. Effectively cracking down on loan sharks could alleviate some of the distress caused to the families left behind, but given the law will still allow for the borrowing, just at fairer interest rates, it is unlikely to make an impact on the wider net of ruthless exploitation behind human trafficking and smuggling."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Arrest of Would-Be Zetas Shows Risk of US Military Infiltration. United States drug enforcement agents have broken up a ring involving former and current US military personnel attempting to work for Mexico's brutal Zetas drug cartel, illustrating the group's alarming potential to penetrate the US military. On March 24, First Lt. Kevin Corley (pictured, at left) arrived with a three-man team at a warehouse in the border city of Laredo, Texas, armed with two semiautomatic rifles, a combat knife and a .300-caliber bolt-action rifle equipped with a scope. The men believed they had been hired by the Zetas to carry out a contracted killing and raid of a rival drug trafficking group's storehouse, and had been called to receive the final details of the assignment. What they didn't know, however, was that they were targets of an elaborate sting operation organized by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. For the past six months, Corley had been speaking with DEA agents posing as Zetas representatives, and had promised both to carry out ""wet work"" (a military euphemism for assassinations) for the cartel as well as equip and train Zetas members in military tactics. According to a federal indictment (.pdf) , Corley claimed that his status as an active duty soldier made it easy for him to pilfer weaponry from his post in Colorado, and demonstrated this by providing the agents with bulletproof vests, training manuals and other stolen military equipment. However, after receiving phony instructions from the undercover operatives in the warehouse, the four men found themselves surrounded by federal law enforcement officers. Although agents killed one of the suspects while attempting to make an arrest, the remaining three were taken into custody. Two other accomplices based in South Carolina were arrested in conjunction with the sting operation. While the fact that six US citizens were so completely willing to work for the Zetas is disturbing, the most worrisome aspect of this case is the fact that all four members of the would-be ""kill team"" (with the exception of the individual killed by federal agents, who was a cousin of Corley's) were either current or former members of the US military. This is a troubling reminder that US military personnel are not immune to the kinds of incentives that lure their military counterparts in Mexico into joining the Zetas. The Zetas' links to the Mexican military have been a trademark of the group since their early days working as the enforcement wing of the Gulf Cartel. Their original 31 founders were all ex-members of the Mexican special forces, and today the group is thought to have deeply penetrated the military in the states of Hidalgo, Chihuahua and Tabasco, as well as other parts of the country. As the drug gang's trafficking networks have grown, they have expanded their recruitment pool to include members of security forces in Guatemala , Honduras , El Salvador and Nicaragua. Until now, however, there had been no hard proof that the cartel was capable of hiring US-trained military professionals to carry out its work. These arrests show that there is a very real possibility of such a trend, no doubt sounding alarm bells for US drug enforcement agents already concerned about the prospect of ""spillover violence"" in the American southwest. The case is especially relevant in light of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's recent warnings that the US military is facing ""significant criminal threat"" from gangs within its ranks. In the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment released in October, the FBI names some 50 criminal organizations that count both current and ex-soldiers among their members. The list includes the Zetas, as well as a handful of transnational street gangs such as Mara Salvatrucha ( MS-13 ), Barrio 18 and Barrio Azteca. Although they represent only a tiny fraction of veterans and servicemen, the FBI cautions that many gang members enlist in order to ""receive weapons and combat training that they may transfer back to their gang."" The report also notes an uptick in gang-related graffiti in military bases overseas. This phenomenon is a threat not only to the US, but to other countries in the hemisphere as well. If enough members of transnational criminal organizations acquire military expertise in the US, there is a chance that they will share these skills with affiliate cells in other countries in the region, potentially giving them a leg up against local officials. As InSight Crime has pointed out, many gangs already have the organizational infrastructure in place to do so. Both of El Salvador's largest ""maras"" (street gangs) got their start in US prisons, and still maintain a strong presence in major cities like Los Angeles and Washington, DC. Despite these concerns, the US military is a long way from seeing the kind of criminal penetration that plagues the Mexican army. That all six members of the ""Zetas"" plot had been under surveillance for months and eventually apprehended is a testament to the success that US law enforcement has had in foiling such criminal endeavors. Even still, with the Zetas growing more and more sophisticated , the risk of infiltration grows greater, and the US military may need to step up its internal monitoring to prevent this. a three-man team "	1	1	0	1	0	0	0
"Paraguay Struggles to Overcome Challenges in Crop Substitution. A group of farmers in Paraguay announced they might return to marijuana cultivation, revealing the limits and challenges that crop substitution programs are facing throughout the region. On October 1, members of the Farmers Committee Association (Asociacion de Comites de Productores) in Kamba Rembe, a town in Paraguay's southern San Pedro department, announced that they might return to marijuana farming. The announcement came after the Paraguayan government allegedly failed to comply with a series of marijuana crop substitution assistance projects, reported Ultima Hora. Daniel Romero, an association leader, said that ""the situation has become untenable. Families are going hungry. They have nothing left to eat, and many unfortunately decided to go back to growing marijuana if we don't have an answer from the authorities this week."" Paraguay is currently the main marijuana producer in the Southern Cone region of South America, primarily feeding markets in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Most of the nearly 5,000 hectares of marijuana farms in the country are concentrated in or near Kamba Rembe, with others located in the departments of Amambay, Concepcion and Canindeyu, according to the country's National Anti-Drug Secretariat (Secretaria Nacional Antidrogas - SENAD). Kamba Rembe dominated both headlines and the attention of former President Horacio Cartes' administration in 2015, when its residents protested in favor of marijuana cultivation as a response to the government's supposed absence from the area. The demonstration resulted in the announcement of a series of programs to replace marijuana with sesame crops. The government of recently elected President Mario Abdo has also indicated that it must ""offer alternatives to the residents of the area in such a way that they stop farming drugs and start doing legal work."" The Abdo administration also promised to implement Agriculture Ministry programs to mechanize small-scale farming for sesame cultivation in the area. The farmers' announcement of their likely return to marijuana cultivation as a result of the government's alleged failure reveals the flaws in imposing legal crops that might not be economically viable. According to Kamba Rembe farmers, cultivating sesame, as proposed by the government, would not help them generate enough income to survive. One kilogram of marijuana sells for up to $30, at least thirty times more than a kilogram of sesame or manioc, another crop commonly grown in the area, according to an investigation by the newspaper La Nacion. Nearly 80 percent of the 4,500 farmers in Kamba Rembe cultivate marijuana. Meanwhile, the Paraguayan government eradicated nearly 2,500 hectares of marijuana crops in 2017, a new record. But that only constitutes half of the land devoted to farming the illicit crop, a sign that this strategy may not be at a functional level either. However, drug raids are on the rise with a recent highlight being the June seizure of nearly 14 metric tons of marijuana in San Pedro, the same department where Kamba Rembe is located. Authorities have linked the seized shipment to an individual who was arrested just a few kilometers from the town. Paraguay is not alone in facing criticism regarding its crop substitution policies. Colombia is perhaps the region's clearest example of a country battling increasing coca cultivation. Its government has also been accused of noncompliance with illicit crop substitution programs, which was one of the items set out in the historic peace agreement signed with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) in 2016. While the Colombian government has made efforts to implement its crop substitution programs, they have not gone far enough, and the programs have still not reached many illicit crop farmers. InSight Crime field research has shown that this directly increases the risk of expanding illegal crop cultivation. Add to this the government's continued policies of aggressive eradication that include the use of glyphosate, which has incited social protest and damaged the local communities' confidence that the state is complying with the alternative strategies it agreed to. Ironically, the push behind both the repression and substitution initiatives did not prevent Colombia from registering record levels of coca crops in 2017. In some of the poorest and most remote regions in Latin America, small-scale, local farmers may inevitably see the cultivation of illegal crops as an activity that will bring them high returns despite the risk of facing authorities, a risk that only diminishes with a lack of state presence."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Report Finds Peru Timber Trade Taken Over by Criminal Networks. A new report offering a detailed breakdown of Peru's timber trade exposes the staggering levels of illegality that have contaminated the country's wood supply chain and the constant evolution of trafficking networks. In the report , ""Authorized to Steal: Organized Crime Networks Launder Illegal Timber from the Peruvian Amazon,"" the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) analyzes 1,024 Forest Transport Permits (Guias de Transporte Forestal - GTF). These documents accompany wood shipments ostensibly as a mark of their legality, but are often traded on the black market to launder illegally logged wood. The GTFs, which cover a three-month period in 2017, record the passage of timber from the northeastern departments of Loreto, Ucayali, Huanaco and San Martin through a control point on the road to Lima. Most of the shipments that the documents represent were backed by Forest Management Plans, which detail where loggers can work and what they can log. Of those with plans, 44 percent were inspected by the Agency for the Supervision of Forest Resources (Organismo de Supervision de los Recursos Forestales - OSINFOR), the government body charged with supervising the timber trade. Fifty-eight percent of those inspected appeared on OSINFOR's ""red list,"" which identifies logging operations with a high risk of illegality. OSINFOR inspects logging operations in timber concessions, indigenous communities, private lands, and ""local forests"" - a framework that grants limited logging permissions to local communities in jungle areas. The GTF data shows clear patterns in which of these is most attractive to timber traffickers. Inspections of shipments coming from local forests found 98% came from operations on OSINFOR's red list, while 94 percent of inspected wood from private lands and 76 percent from indigenous communities also came from operations that appear on the red list. In contrast, just 6 percent of the shipments from timber concessions were on the red list. Of the remaining 56 percent of shipments that OSINFOR had not inspected, it is impossible to say what percentage is likely illegal. 8 percent of these were from Forest Plantations, which OSINFOR does not have jurisdiction over. The remaining 48 percent were either not inspected by OSINFOR, were not reported to OSINFOR for supervision, or the GTF did not include the resolution number for the Forest Management Plan, without which it is impossible to trace whether or not an operation has been inspected. Timber trafficking in Peru is carried out by a range of criminal actors , from individual traders to large sophisticated networks, and is facilitated by rampantly corrupt officials. The CIEL report identifies and names several forestry officials that have consistently signed off on falsified plans yet faced no repercussions. What the report makes clear is just how much of the industry these criminal actors have captured. CIEL's analysis could only identify around a quarter of the timber shipments examined as highly likely being of illegal origins, but it could also only identify 18 percent that were highly likely to be legal. In highlighting how the majority of shipments go uninspected, the report draws attention to the manipulated paperwork, grey areas and loopholes that are exploited by timber traffickers. In addition to this, there is also a significant part of the trade that operates entirely outside of this framework, with wood sold directly on local markets or smuggled over the border to Peru's neighboring countries. Taking these sections of the industry into account, experts consulted by InSight Crime believe the true levels of illegality in Peru's timber trade could reach as high as 80 percent, representing hundreds of millions of dollars for timber trafficking networks. The report's breakdown of the levels of illegality in the different types of logging areas also illustrates how trafficking has evolved to avoid the attentions of OSINFOR. Initially, OSINFOR's inspections focused on timber concessions, leading to a surge in illegality in native communities as traffickers sought out alternatives. When OSINFOR began to turn its attention to these communities, there was an increase in the use of local forests. With traffickers determined to keep one step ahead, there is already evidence that their next target is likely to be forestry plantations, which lie outside of OSINFOR's reach. However, for one of the authors of the report, and former head of OSINFOR, Rolando Navarro, the most damning aspect of the CIEL report is that there is little sign that Peru's 2015 forestry law, which brought a series of new regulations and sanctions designed to tackle timber trafficking, has had a significant impact on criminality in the supply chain. ""This report provides evidence that nothing has changed with the new forestry law,"" Navarro told InSight Crime. ""The same actors continue operating with impunity using the same schemes and modus operandi as before. Eco-Trafficking Peru "	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Peru Wildlife Agency Eases Export of Illegal Shark Fins. Peru's government agency entrusted with protecting endangered species is under investigation for collaborating with shark fin traffickers who export illegal product to Asian markets, shining a spotlight on the state's complicity in this illicit catch. An investigation by Ojo-Publico has revealed how the the Ministry of Production (Ministerio de la Produccion - PRODUCE), which is responsible for the protection of species threatened by illegal trade, facilitated the nation's booming illicit shark fin industry by certifying illegally caught and harvested product. Following record seizures of almost 50 tons of shark fins by Peru's customs office between November 2018 and December 2019, the country's authorities have launched an investigation into the administrative body that certifies wildlife exports. The majority of shark fins trafficked from Peru end up in China, where a kilogram can sell for up to $700. Global trade in the commodity is worth close to $1 billion a year, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Peru is the world's third largest exporter of shark fins, both legally and illegally sourced, shipping an estimated $25 million worth of the product to Hong Kong between 2014 and 2018, reported Ojo-Publico. Major exporters of black market shark products in the country reportedly maintain links with key personnel within the Ministry of Production. The authority is entrusted with issuing permits under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a global mechanism to oversee wildlife exports. These officials fast track CITES authorizations for select companies, helping them bypass legal obstacles and certifying illegal exports under the guise of legitimate trade. Four CITES certificates were approved last year for a shark fin export company that has been linked to the alleged boss of a criminal organization known as ""Los Piratas de Puerto Pizarro"" (The Pirates of the Pizarro Port). The group operated out of the northwestern coastal city of Tumbes, and its 44 members have been accused of a number of crimes, including homicide and robbery. With the sale of shark fins still permitted in Peru, corrupt actors are able to easily camouflage fins harvested from protected species within legal shipments of the product. This allows the contraband to enter international markets under CITES certification. An escalating demand for shark fins from Asian markets, where a pricey soup featuring the ingredient is considered a delicacy, has fueled a spike in the export of the animal product from Peru over the last several years. While there have been superficial attempts at installing measures against the shark fin trade, political will to combat environmental crime in Peru has historically been low. The country's customs authorities are ill-equipped and undertrained, leaving them unable to distinguish between the legal and illegal species of shark fin. As a result, they are incapable of properly implementing CITES requirements, allowing criminals to continue exploiting security flaws in the system. The ""lack of regulation and enforcement"" in the international shark fin industry, reported the South China Morning Post , has seen ""legal and illegal products blend into an impossible-to-separate quagmire."" At the same time, corrupt PRODUCE officials are actively facilitating fin traffickers, allowing them to circumvent environmental regulations and move hundreds of tons of the product through the country's ports every year. The same dynamics are evident in other types of eco trafficking in Peru. The country's logging industry mirrors the shark fin fishery as a magnet for corruption. In 2017, one in seven of the nation's forestry officials was under investigation due to falsifying the origins of illegally extracted timber. Around a quarter of the world's 500 shark species are currently under threat of extinction. Of the 68 shark varieties inhabiting Peru's heavily overfished waters, some are already endangered. Traffickers, however, will continue to exploit lax customs controls in Peru as long as there is cash to be made in the trade of illegally harvested fins."	0	1	0	0	0	1	0
Could Brazils Environmental Law Reform Strengthen Animal Trafficking Networks?Activists say that a controversial law recently passed by Brazil's Congress could lead to increased deforestation in the Amazon. If the law puts less pressure on farmers to preserve forest land, animal traffickers could possibly take advantage of the situation. On April 26 the lower house of Congress approved the new controversial forest code, which activists say is too lenient on farmers who clear woodlands for agriculture. Critics also say the code eases the rules on the amount of forest that farmers must preserve. President Rousseff must sign off on the bill before it becomes law, but there is a good chance that she will veto it, reports Reuters. While deforestation rates in the Amazon have dropped steadily since 2004, one concern is that an uptick in deforestation could work to the advantage of Brazil's many organized crime groups involved in the wildlife trade. There are thought to be as many as 300 criminal gangs who steal endangered species from the Amazon for sale on the black market. Many of Brazil's states most affected by deforestation -- including Matto Grosso, Rondonia, Para, and Bahia -- also see some of the country's highest rates of wildlife trafficking. The larger, mafia-like groups involved in the wildlife trade are more likely to operate at the frontier between untouched forests and developed farmland, where they have easier access to the infrastructure necessary to transport captured animals to large urban centers in the Southeast region. If deforestation begins to rise again in Brazil, this could give wildlife traffickers even more ground where they can comfortably operate.* According to a 2001 study released by anti-wildlife trafficking NGO Renctas, 38 million wild animals are poached from Brazil's forests every year. About 80 percent of these species are birds, including the Lear's macaw, which can sell for as much $90,000 on the global black market. These types of profits explain why wildlife trafficking is considered one of the most lucrative criminal trades in the world. 	0	0	1	0	0	1	0
Illegal Mining Crackdown May Push Perus Former Miners to Coca, Timber. Authorities in Peru say they have successfully driven illegal gold mining out of the Amazon, but will other illegal economies take its place? Early this year, Peruvian authorities carried out a massive operation to remove some 5,000 illegal gold miners from an area known as La Pampa in the Madre de Dios region. The miners are now gone, but Madre de Dios' governor calculates that 80 percent of the businesses in La Pampa had ties to gold mining and that up to 40,000 people in the region directly or indirectly depended on the mines for their livelihoods, the Miami Herald reported. Locals say violent robberies have increased since the military wiped out the illegal mining site. A spate of robberies targeting tourist buses and nature lodges in Madre de Dios -- one of the Amazon's most biodiverse corners -- has led to the cancelling of nearly half of the planned tours to the region this year. As an increasing number of Peru's illegal miners become desperate for work, they could be enticed by other illicit activities -- including violent crime, coca cultivation and illegal logging. Peru's government has promised some $160 million in funding to formalize and reintegrate illegal miners , as well as bring new businesses to La Pampa, a 20-kilometer stretch of highway full of bars and other businesses that long catered to them. But only $64 million has been approved, and little of it has gone to La Pampa. Even if the government is able to bring new business to La Pampa, there is still the question of what happens to the thousands of illegal miners now out of work. The process of integrating and legalizing the illegal miners has also proven difficult. Few have been granted mining licenses, and incentives to register with the government have largely failed in the past, as illegal miners fear being taxed. Miners in La Pampa were able to earn $100 to $200 in a 24-hour shift, the equivalent of a month's wages in the region. Legal work will not bring anything close to those wages, which means miners may be enticed by other illegal activities common in the region. A similar dynamic was seen in Peru recently when a drop in coffee prices led farmers to find work in coca plantations , where they could earn higher wages. What's more, one of the most important coca growing areas in Peru sits close to La Pampa. The Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valley region, known as the VRAEM, has seen a boom in coca cultivation in recent yers. In 2017, the 21,646 hectares of coca in the river valley accounted for nearly half of the nation's total crop, according to data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Illegal timber logging is also big business in the Madre de Dios region, and could increase with the influx of former miners. Peru has attempted to combat the trade, but it is still a thriving business , accounting for much of the deforestation in the Amazon alongside illegal mining. The dismantling of illegal gold mining in La Pampa is certainly a move in the right direction, but a long-term investment and security plan in Madre de Dios is needed.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
"Peru Running Out of Ideas to Stop Illegal Mining in Madre de Dios. Authorities in Peru launched a large-scale operation aimed at driving out illegal gold mining and other illicit activities in the Madre de Dios region, where similar, previous operations have had little lasting effects. A force of some 1,800 police and military officers were sent to Madre de Dios -- a region of Amazon rainforest bordering Brazil and Bolivia -- to take part in Operation Mercurio 2019, El Comercio reported. The operation seeks to remove more than 5,000 illegal miners and evict thousands of merchants that capitalize on other criminal activities in the area, such as sex trafficking. Already 40 women considered to be trafficking victims have been rescued , according to a local news report. Authorities have also dismantled about 30 illegal mining camps in the area during the first week of the operation. The second phase of the operation will last 180 days, during which three military bases will be installed. Each base will staff 100 soldiers from the army's newly created Amazon Protection Brigade, as well as 50 police officers. The first base has been set up in the zone of ""La Pampa,"" government officials said in a news release on March 5. The government of Peru has dedicated $60 million dollars to the operation, which also plans to formalize and reintegrate illegal miners. Peru's recent assault on illegal gold mining in Madre De Dios is just the latest in a string of similar operations that have failed to stop the practice's expansion. In 2014, police raided the town of Huepetuhe, destroying $20 million worth of mining equipment. Then in 2017, officers destroyed 83 mining camps in an operation also dubbed Mercurio. Yet from to 2009 to 2017, the Madre Dios region saw more than 64,000 hectares of Amazon forest destroyed by illegal mining and logging. In 2018, deforestation from wildcat gold mining, which strips the land and leaves behind pools of mercury, peaked at nearly 10,000 hectares. Stopping the illegal gold trade in Peru has proven to be nearly impossible. The gold ore is easily bought and sold by a network of middlemen, known as ""acopiadores,"" who also provide false receipts, allowing large-scale buyers and export companies to buy the ore, which is then refined abroad. Six years ago, Peru's illegal gold trade was estimated to be worth more than $3 billion , and it has likely only grown since then. Illegal gold mining also brings with it a number of other criminal activities, such as forced labor. The mining sites have also long been hotbeds for human trafficking and prostitution. Peru's government has tried to toughen illegal mining laws, declaring it an organized crime activity , and it has attempted to formalize the industry, by offering incentives to illegal miners to register with the government. Mostly, though, it has tried to drive out illegal miners through police and military operations, of which ""Mercurio 2019"" is the latest example. But it's unlikely that the miners will stay away for long."	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
"Giving the Green Light to Dirty Money: Guatemala. In Guatemala, dirty money leaves the country in tourist class, in the luggage of hundreds of men and women recruited by criminal organizations that export bills of illegal origin. The Public Ministry has identified five networks that move hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars. The traffickers transport cash as far as Panama, which should raise money laundering alarms in the banking system and lead to questions that the owners of the money wouldn't be able to answer without ending up in prison. But if something goes wrong, only the money runners are captured. The owners remain in the shadows, anonymous and free, and from there they recover the lost money -- sometimes through hired assassins. The Public Ministry links the majority of money-laundering cases to drug trafficking. Scene 1: The Ex-Police Officer The detective recognized a face among the people detained that day in La Aurora international airport, in 2011. Since mid-2010, it had been routine to apprehend between 30 and 50 people traveling almost daily with some $9,500 in cash -- $10,000 is the maximum amount that one is allowed to take out of the country without declaring it in the tax agency*(SAT) and IVE form. When the detective approached, he realized that the person he recognized was an ex-policeman who was discharged in 1997, when he failed the renewal exam to pass to the then-new National Civil Police (PNC). - And what are you doing in this? - the detective asked his ex-colleague. - Well, look, there's nothing else for me to do - responded the former police officer. He told the detective that he hadn't been able to earn a salary sufficient to care for his family, and so he now worked as a money runner. - And who does the money belong to, then? - the investigator asked him, knowing that the investigation would go nowhere, because his ex-colleague and the rest of the group (who didn't want to speak) hadn't committed any definite crime. - This is a little bit of everything - responded the ex-policeman candidly - there's money from congress members, ministers, and drug traffickers. Bit by bit, the detective put together the pieces of what emerged as a money-laundering business that sent contraband money to Panama for a motley group of clients. Soon, he uncovered other details by checking passports and interviewing other travelers. Sometimes the groups were from just one state -- Alta Verapaz, Escuintla, etc. Although the majority were from the capital, over time he detected groups from all the states in the country. And not only that; there were also groups organized by municipality and even by neighborhood. ""There were low-income individuals, entire groups from Villa Canales, Villa Nueva, Amatitlan, and even Boca del Monte,"" he revealed. But why? ""Simple,"" says the detective, ""because they come recommended."" He explains that the recruiters are given the task of contracting people they can trust, acquaintances who ""aren't going to do them wrong."" So they call their cousins, neighbors, and friends. ""They communicate through text messages, 'we're about to begin working, get ready,'"" he adds. He read similar messages in the cell phone of one of the couriers who had already traveled several times. Some do it twice a week -- as many as eight times a month. The detective disclosed this information in exchange for anonymity. Monitored Handover According to testimonies collected in police investigations, after the recruiter organizes the group with each person carrying about $9,500, they call everyone to assemble near the airport. They are picked up in different vehicles, in which they are given the money, generally in $20 bills. ""No one counterfeits bills that small because they aren't worth the work, so they are much more secure,"" explains the detective. The money is put in a briefcase with clothing for two or three days, the only baggage that the travelers carry. After receiving the money, the runners are taken to the airport for their flight. ""If they carry a little under $10,000, they receive the flight and $200, of which they are only given half in Guatemala,"" states the source. ""They receive the other half when they arrive in Panama; there they go to a five-star hotel to deliver the money in a room, then they go to a cheap hotel to spend the night, and then they return to Guatemala. And that's how they earn a bit of money."" For traveling once they earn some 1,560 Guatemala quetzales ($200). If they fly to Panama eight times a month, they earn at least 12,480 quetzales ($1,600). Each passenger covers his or her own hotel expenses. Some networks pay between $400 and $2,000 per trip, based on the amount of money transported. The detective reveals that an ""eye"" accompanies the group. This is a traveler who does not carry any money. Their mission is to ensure that the couriers board the plane and arrive at the designated hotel to hand over the money. One of the five-star hotels where the couriers deliver the dollars has among its associates a Colombian millionaire declared non-grata in Panama, according to a source within the Public Ministry. But this is just one of the delivery points that is under a joint investigation by Panamanian and Guatemalan authorities. The police baptized this type of movement as ""ant trafficking."" If each group involves 30 to 50 people, the group transports $285,000-$475,000. ""It was a fortune! They took out millions. The Copa flights to Panama were full,"" says the detective, alarmed. ""But we couldn't detain anyone because there wasn't enough of a legal base; they told us that they were traders that were going to buy electrical appliances. The women said that they were going to buy cosmetics, handbags."" But the interrogations didn't last long. None of the passengers ever missed their flight. The majority of the travelers are Guatemalan, men and women similar in size, according to the source. ""There is the occasional Colombian, but when they are very dark we see that some are Ecuadorians or Peruvians, some Venezuelans and Costa Ricans, and they rotate in that fashion,"" he states. ""The majority of the foreigners are men, and they travel with larger sums. They come to Guatemala for three days or a week and tend to stay in hotels in zone 10, in the Quinta Real on the highway to El Salvador, or in the Tikal Futura hotel."" Their ages range from 20 to 60 years old. Large-Scale Transfer The police detective says that the ant trafficking*method declined after the first round of elections in September of 2011. Rolando Rodenas, head of the Anti-Money Laundering Prosecutors Office, contends that it continues, and that through this method at least $4 million leaves the country each month. The method appears infallible. Although the cases occur in the airport, the Director of Social Communication at the General Board of Civil Aeronautics (DGAC), Oddra Lacs, states that the identification and arrest of the launderers is the responsibility of the union of Police of Ports and Airports (DIPA), and not the DGAC. And although some traffickers have been able to mock*the law, Rodenas maintains that ""the job of the good police in the airport"" has discovered how these structures operate. The police detective says that the movement of large sums continued parallel to the ant trafficking method, but less frequently. He adds that the travelers deliver a suitcase to their contact a day before leaving the country. The contact returns it to the courier in the airport, after inserting a double pocket (among other methods) in which to hide the money. ""From that moment, they are under surveillance,"" says the detective. In October 2011, Ricardo Dieguez Garcia, a 61-year-old Guatemalan (a resident of the Alameda III neighborhood in zone 18) was apprehended while trying to carry $80,000 to Panama in cigarette packs. One month later, Adriana and Karla Mendez Montes, two sisters from Costa Rica, were stopped as they tried to travel to their country with $70,174 hidden in their luggage. Just 10 days later, a couple -- Luz Lara Martinez and Manolo Diaz Gonzalez, 26 and 22 years old, respectively -- were arrested on a plane that would have taken them to Panama. Authorities confiscated $1.1 million from the pair. On January 30, 2011, Genovevo Perez Medina, a 40-year-old Mexican, was arrested in the airport while carrying $257,000 in his luggage. However, he was not heading to Panama. He stopped over in Panama after flying out of Lima, Peru, and his final destination was Guatemala. On March 9, 2011, Trinidad Claudio Sequen, a 39-year-old Colombian, did not even arrive at the boarding zone. Authorities discovered that he was carrying $25,500 undeclared ($8,000 in a double pocket in his suitcase; $5,000 hidden in his clothing; and 12,500 in his stomach, in latex capsules). His trip from Cali, Colombia, was foiled. Just 12 days later, Juan Cayetano Perez Laparra, 41, was also captured in the airport while carrying at least $10,000 in latex capsules in his stomach, another $2,980 hidden in his baggage, and $100 in his pants. The detective suspects that most of the money that is confiscated comes from the profits of drug traffickers. In 2011 alone, the National Civil Police reported having seized $3.2 million in cash from drug traffickers -- or 25 billion Guatemalan quetzales. Undesirable Consequences Rodenas, who has been the head of the*Anti-Money Laundering Prosecutors Office*since February 2011, reveals that before that month numerous people were released without the money they were carrying being confiscated. This was the case with two Colombians detained in 2003 in zone 14 of the capital with $14 million, whose money laundering crime was commuted for personal concealment. They were released on bail. ""The situation is complicated because in order to arrest a person and begin the legal process for money laundering you had to prove that there had been a prior crime,"" explains Rodenas. That is to say, that the money was obtained illegally. ""And the prior crime is not always established."" Rodenas maintains that the discrepancy between the detainee's economic profile and the money that they carry, and the lack of proof that the money is clean, justifies the arrests. ""It's necessary to look at the entire context,"" he adds. Article 25 of the Law Against Money Laundering says that sums of money exceeding $10,000 must declared when taken into or out of Guatemala. Article 4 of the law has a provision that sentences the criminal to between six and 20 non-commutable years in prison, and confiscates the money. The penalty is greater if the detained individual is a public sector employee. Foreigners that are imprisoned for this crime are sent to their country of origin after completing the sentence. Those who remain at large, but without the money in their hands, are not safe. A MP investigator says that not much is said about the outcome for the runners who lose the money in a seizure, because they flee with it, or because they are assaulted. In small and large scale money laundering, someone is always watching over the couriers and the money. The recommendation system used to recruit couriers also means that the recruiter shares the responsibility, and sometimes the punishment. The organization will know where to find them and where their families live. ""There are cases of people identified as money runners that have disappeared, and at least one that was killed,"" says the Public Ministry investigator. ""We know that in some cases, there are police officers that protect the money and keep watch over those who transport it; others collect the money, reporting it as lost or stolen, or act as hired assassins against any transporters that fail. If they don't show up, they go for the runner's family members."" The Public Ministry and the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) are carrying out legal procedures against police for extrajudicial killings, although none have been linked to this type of case yet. In 2009, authorities seized about $4.5 million in the airport. The amount increased to about $7 million in 2010, and reached $9 million in 2011. The police detective states that the shipment of large quantities, which tends to be only in $100 bills, has been happening for at least 10 years. He also says that the ant trafficking*method was not really used between 2007 and 2009. ""There were military officials and other retired officers that facilitated operations (the shipment of larger quantities of money), who later disappeared, but with the new government, some have returned."" Nevertheless, Lacs pledges that no DGAC report shows that the employees that began to work in the airport in 2012 had worked there under previous administrations. Scene II: Illegal Money Declared Some money launderers are so audacious that they officially declare the money that they are carrying, pass through security controls, and board a flight towards Panama without breaking a sweat. Rodenas indicates that the sums declared exceed $50,000, ""because the law doesn't require that they reveal the origin of the money"" in the SAT and IVE forms. A detailed examination of the information presented on the forms yields several findings, according to the authority: a) the passengers pose as businesspeople or legal representatives, and register addresses that belong to cardboard businesses; b) on other occasions, the address corresponds to a notary office, and several forms show the same address although the individuals filling them out say they represent different businesses; c) in some cases, the passengers registered on the forms as business representatives appear on other forms as notaries of different businesses, and d) the accounting records that are traceable because the form shows a real business or address indicate little to no money movement in the accounts, which is inconsistent with the generation of the $50,000-$100,000 declared on the form. By the time the Public Ministry recognizes that a form has false information or shows irregularities, it's too late. The traveller is already far away. However, Rodenas says that ""the outflow of declared money has decreased"" due to effective police work in the airport and the systematization of gathered information that allows them to create profiles of the laundering structures. ""Ninety-nine percent of the reports in the IVE come from there,"" he says, referring to the cases of declared money in the airport. ""The information on the forms produces indices with which to investigate unusual or suspect situations."" Rodenas admits that these criminal networks know how to use loopholes in the law. ""We are almost certain that the money is illicit because what serious businessperson is going to travel with piles of bills in their luggage?"" he asks. ""If the money were obtained legally, and they had nothing to hide, they would do an electronic money transfer to the country that they are traveling to."" The police detective says that two traffickers from the Veliz Palomo organization traveled in that way. This is a network that the Public Ministry dismantled in 2010, which had sent at least $350,000 to Panama (the product of extortion and drug sales). By September 2010, the ministry had arrested 35 members of the organization, including an assistant prosecutor who allegedly helped them by trying to impede the investigation. They began with ant trafficking, with about 400 people carrying money in small quantities to Panama, and ended declaring larger sums. ""There were two women in the Veliz Palomo organization that always traveled to Panama with $9,000; later, each one of them began to transport $50,000, $150,000, and up to $250,000, and they declared the money on the forms,"" says the detective. ""Both of them said they were businesswomen."" On February 15, 2011, 48 members of the organization, including a Panamanian, were convicted with prison sentences ranging between three and 56 years on charges of money laundering, among other crimes. Only one of the accused went free. Scene III: Protocol and Private Flights In July 2011, two employees of the*Office of Judicial Protocol*(OJ) -- Jose Guerra Aldana and Luis Vallejo Guerra, 28 and 25 years old respectively -- were arrested for allowing individuals who, disguised as public employees and carrying false identification, used the protocol area in La Aurora Airport to remove large quantities of money from the country. The arrests were carried out by security officers working for the OJ, and the suspects were accused of money laundering, conspiracy, illicit collaboration, and abuse of authority. These arrests reduced -- nearly eliminated, according to Rodenas -- the transfer of money through the security area. On March 29, 2011, police captured four people that had been linked to using the protocol area of the airport for illegal money relocation to Panama, Costa Rica, and the United States. One of them, Walter Estrada Hernandez, 43, was a delegate for the Foreign Ministry, and is accused of abuse of authority, money laundering and illicit collaboration. Miguel Lopez Castellanos, 34, supervised ""Finger International,"" and is accused of abuse of authority, none-payment of duties, and obstruction of justice. Edgar Alvarado Merlos, 39, is accused of a special case of tax fraud, perjury, and illicit collaboration. Mario Alfredo Santizo, 18 years old, is accused of racketeering and falsification of documents. Although the Public Ministry divulged that the network had taken at least $10 million out of the country, by April 2 Estrada Hernandez and Lopez Castellanos were free on bail (of 10,000 ($1,300) and 2,500 ($323) quetzales, respectively), although they remained linked to the investigation. The police detective recalls that between 2010 and 2011, following the arrival of a group at the registry area before boarding, airport scanners detected what appeared to be packets of bills in the luggage of the travelers. ""They had letters of recommendation from everyone; they were untouchable,"" explains the investigator. ""I remember that one of them dropped a credential, and he reached out quickly to pick it up, but before he did I saw what looked like the emblem of the National Palace of Culture. I didn't have time to read any more."" The group went on without trouble. The most scandalous case was that of Gloria Torres, sister of the ex-first lady Sandra Torres in 2011, which the morning newspaper elPeriodico and Plaza Publica reported last year, when authorities announced a warrant for the arrest of Gloria Torres and her two daughters for money laundering and defrauding at least two municipalities. DGAC and Foreign Ministry documents published by both sources show that the employees in the security area notified the supervisor of the international area as well as the general supervisor of the airport that six people using the systems at the request of Gloria Torres carried money hidden in their bags. They reported that they had not detained them because they were backed by the then-first lady, Sandra Torres, and her sister Gloria. Estrada Hernandez and Lopez Castellanos, detained in March and released in April, are tied to this case for not preventing the departure of those travelers although they knew that they were carrying undeclared cash. The reporters of this case had access to a document from Congress' Protocol Directorate, in which one of the runners, Ramiro Salas, was identified as a member of the Secretariat of Administrative Affairs and Security as well as the pilot for Gloria Torres. ElPeriodico reported that the group had made at least 15 trips to Panama. An investigator following the case said that Torres and her accomplices also carried money to Belize and presumably transported funds to other destinations from there. While the Public Ministry states that it is still investigating the ties between Torres and the detained runners, a detective that followed the case says that the money taken out of the country came from several owners, including Gloria Torres, and alleged drug trafficker Juan Ortiz, alias ""Chamale"" or ""Hermano Juan."" When Ortiz was captured on March 30, 2011, and he was unprotected, he requested the aid of two people: one of them was supposedly Gloria Torres; the other was the then-Minister of Defense, Abraham Valenzuela, who was separated from the charge for this reason. Lacs explains that in 2012, ""the security area depended on the Foreign Ministry for diplomats, and for flight security personnel (AVSEC) for heads of state."" However, she says that all users of the security area pass ""through all the migration, customs, and security procedures, with no exceptions."" Unpunished Passengers In 2004, the police investigator was sent to examine a private plane arriving from Chile. He received the information from a diplomatic delegation from that country, which had communicated the suspicion that the plane might be transporting something illegal. When the plane touched down, the detective boarded and asked the passengers to remain in the plane and give him their identification documents. The detective says that when he opened one of the passports, he was shocked. There he read a last name that indicated that the individual might be related to a high-ranking official from the executive branch. Almost immediately the passenger gave him the answer he anticipated: - Ok, and you don't know who I am? - he yelled. - Yes, but what's the problem? If you all don't have anything to hide, I don't see the inconvenience in my reviewing your IDs - the investigator responded calmly. The subject calmed down, and said nothing. The investigator and other police officers examined the plane, but found nothing. The detective says that upon returning to his office he called the diplomatic delegation and told them what had happened. Their speaker told him that they already knew who was traveling in the plane, that they had heard the travelers were taking money towards South America, and they had hoped to find some evidence in the plane. The investigator asked why they had not ordered the arrest of the individuals, if they already knew what was happening. ""Because they are untouchable without proof,"" responded the speaker. The investigator says that between 2006 and 2007, the security and diplomatic area of La Aurora Airport was used by individuals identified as deputies from the Central American Parliament, and that the brother of one of them carried packets of money, revealed by the security scanners. ""They had credentials (whose legitimacy couldn't be proven), and letters from superior authorities giving them permission to depart."" The detective added that in 2011 the number of passengers declaring that they were traveling with amounts greater than $100,000 increased, and that they used private planes. ""Here, the airport is synonymous with money,"" he states. Scene IV: Laundering by Land, Money on Wheels The money laundering land routes in Guatemala are linked to aerial smuggling towards the south of Central America. ""We discovered that the objective of the land routes was to move money towards the capital, where it could be taken out of the country by flights from the airport,"" explains Rodenas. The money is brought to the country from Mexico. By February 2012, authorities had detected ""54 unofficial crossing points for vehicles, according to the*Guatemala-Mexico*International Comission of Boundaries and Water,"" says Werner Ovalle, a consultant from the Central American System of Integration (SICA). There were many more blind spots for people crossing on foot. In March 2011, in Mazatenango, Suchitepequez, a man driving a Toyota pick-up was detained. Under the truck bed (palangana) he was carrying $2.7 million. The man, whose criminal record was clean, entered the country through a blind spot on the Mexican border. Last January, the police intercepted another suspect in Suchitepequez with at least $90,000 hidden in his vehicle. The Public Ministry reports that in August of 2011, in Amatitlan, the police arrested a married couple -- the husband was from Ecuador and his wife from Guatemala -- who were carrying $8,000 on their persons. The couple was transporting another $58,000 in the spare tire of the vehicle. They were extradited and, according to the Public Ministry, were later found dead. The official investigation suggests that the couple was associated with a woman from Quetzaltenango who is married to a sailor (lanchero) and associated with drug trafficking. At present, Rodenas does not believe that there are defined smuggling routes. It appears that there is no boss. Traffickers enter the country from Mexico any way they can, in all sorts of vehicles -- from sleek pick up trucks to cars that are at least a decade old. Logic dictates that the land routes are less monitored and therefore preferred by smugglers. But the greater risk is losing the money in a robbery or assault, on a path that takes much longer to travel from Guatemala to Panama. The police detective affirms that this is why traffickers prefer to send the money by plane. Moreover, the consequences of losing money forces traffickers to look for the safest and quickest routes. Scene V: A Test of Strength Between Traffickers and Authorities At least five structures pull the strings in the money smuggling industry. An investigation by the Public Ministry helped authorities identify the heads of the operations: one ""very violent"" Mexican women, according to an investigator from the Money Laundering Unit who prefers not to be named; a Colombian from Cali who was captured in April 2011 in zone 13 with $429,000, identified as Julian Andres Jaramillo Camposano, 25, who is linked to drug-trafficking; a couple consisting of the Panamanian Waldo Curtis (with an arrest warrant in Panama for laundering $1 million) and the Guatemalan Tania Zambrano; and three Guatemalan suspects, two of whom control the fourth structure, and the other, the fifth structure. Aside from the Colombian, no other big fish has been caught (except for case of Veliz Palomo), but there are at least 20 warrants for the arrest of suspects associated with ant trafficking, and at least half of the people linked to carrying undeclared money out of the country have been detained. The authorities have between 135 and 140 arrest warrants pending execution, as well as no less than 250 open cases. They still have some 65 cases from 2010. From 2011 alone, they have another 225 cases, and by the first week of March the count for 2012 approached 27. The attorney general has five official assistants and four agents for the entire country. In theory, every official who receives a report of money laundering should send the case to the Anti-Money Laundering Prosecutors' Office (within a stipulated time frame), but they do not always do so, and sometimes open the case in their jurisdiction. Lacs says that in the first 60 days of the current government, authorities detected ""more passengers with money, jewelry, and drugs than in prior years,"" due to inter-institutional actions that encourage training to international standards. However, until the beginning of March, the attorney general calculated a monthly average of money laundering cases less that was less than 2011. Lacs also says that, in order to make the measures more effective, the US Embassy in Guatemala donated equipment ""unique in Central America,"" which detects illicit substances or contraband money. The new equipment, a modern scanner, was installed in the police's anti-drug agency (SGAIA, formerly the DAIA) in La Aurora International Airport. On March 28, 2011, it was inaugurated by Secretary of State William Brownfield during his visit to Guatemala. But the equipment only helps to arrest of the couriers, and not those who own the millions of laundered dollars. It detects money that, according to the ex-police officer who was traveling to Panama last year, belongs to drug traffickers as often as to public officials -- money that has been printed or robbed with impunity. The preliminary results of a study by La Red (an organization directed by former vice president of Guatemala Eduardo Stein) about money laundering through bank transactions, points out that the main source of money laundered electronically is the government (state funds obtained through corruption). This is followed by money from extortion (of small businesses, airlines, or households) and then drug trafficking. This means that, until now, drug smugglers have found an alternative way of transferring money, which may explain the ant trafficking method and trafficking of large sums of money (declared or undeclared). Other investigations focusing on taxes, assembled in an article of the Global Integrity Report, name tax evasion as the principal source of contraband money, together with drug trafficking and corruption. But although the authorities have gathered important information, it is not enough to assume that ""if the river is making noise, it's because it carries stones,"" or that the results will be obtained. For Rodenas, ""the stones have to make noise, and we have to prove that they exist."" According to the official, the only limit on investigating the money laundering ringleaders is imagination, which is needed to stay one step ahead of them. ""These people are not unintelligent, but nor are they perfect,"" he asserts.

FARC Smuggle Explosives into Cities via Ecuador Border: Police. Colombian police have identified routes along the Ecuadorean border they say are used by the FARC to smuggle high-grade explosives into major Colombian cities. According to La Hora , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) is smuggling the military-grade explosive pentolite from Ecuador into the Colombian border city of Ipiales, from where it is moved northwards to bigger cities like Popayan, Cali, and Bogota. The shipments are hidden in parcels and carried by courier services, which have been placed under surveillance by the authorities. Colombian law enforcement has seized six shipments of pentolite in the past three months, police said. The FARC often use pentolite for making bombs and carrying out urban attacks. Several explosive devices discovered near police stations in Bogota in the past week have contained pentolite. The substance was used in the bomb attack against former Interior Minister Fernando Londono on May 15. On Friday, a presumed member of the FARC was killed in Bogota when the pentolite device he was building exploded, injuring three others. Unsurprisingly, the routes used by the FARC to move explosives appear to overlap with the 26 unsanctioned border crossings identified by the Ecuadorean Defense Ministry last week. Several of these illegal border crossings are only a few kilometers from Ipiales, which the Colombian national police indicate is a key transshipment point for explosives. These announcements are likely the product of a meeting that took place between Ecuadorean and Colombian officials in Bogota in March, when both countries agreed to locate and identify illegal frontier crossings by May. Such cooperation to combat criminal organizations has been on the rise since relations between the Andean countries improved following Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos' inauguration. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"U.S. Department of Justice - Interim Review of ATFs Project Gunrunner. This interim review, issued in September 2009 by the U.S. Justice Department, identifies problems within Project Gunrunner, an initiative by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) meant to reduce the illicit flow of firearms from the U.S. to Mexico. The document notes, ""In our view some planned Project Gunrunner activities do not appear to represent the best use of resources to reduce firearms trafficking, and issues with new office locations, staffing structure, personnel with Spanish proficiency, and program measures need to be addressed."" The report concludes with seven recommendations for possible improvements in Project Gunrunner, including developing measures to more accurately evaluate the impact of the project. From the executive summary: In our review, we concluded that aspects of ATF's Project Gunrunner expansion plans will enhance its ability to combat firearms trafficking. However, in our view some planned Project Gunrunner activities do not appear to represent the best use of resources to reduce firearms trafficking, and issues with new office locations, staffing structure, personnel with Spanish proficiency, and program measures need to be addressed. ATF has reported that by September 30, 2010, it plans to place Gunrunner resources (personnel, offices, and equipment) dedicated to firearms trafficking investigations in McAllen, Texas; El Centro, California; and Las Cruces, New Mexico, including a satellite office in Roswell, New Mexico. Each of the three office locations will be staffed by a Gunrunner team, which will consist of Special Agents, Industry Operation Investigators, Intelligence Research Specialists, and Investigative Analysts. Four ATF agents will also be located in Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana, Mexico. We believe the decisions to place new Gunrunner resources in McAllen, El Centro, Juarez, and Tijuana to be sound, based on ATF's own criteria and our additional analysis. However, we question the decision to place Gunrunner teams in Las Cruces and Roswell. We also concluded that the staffing model ATF plans to use for the new Gunrunner teams appears adequate, provided ATF defines the reporting and supervisory structure. However, we found that ATF has insufficient numbers of personnel proficient in Spanish on Gunrunner teams."" Finally, we concluded that more specific program measures are needed to accurately measure Project Gunrunner's impact on cross-border firearms trafficking. In this interim report we make seven recommendations for ATF to improve its allocation of resources and implementation of Project Gunrunner expansion plans. Read full report. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Argentina Asset Seizure Decree Debuts with Mixed Reviews. For the first time, authorities in Argentina are using a criminal asset seizure program -- a legal mechanism that strips criminal groups of their wealth but comes with potential pitfalls. On July 16, Argentina's Attorney General's Office requested the forfeiture of nearly $19 million in assets from members of the Loza clan, a large criminal organization with international connections. This was the first large-scale use of a decree signed by President Mauricio Macri that created the Asset Seizure Regime (Regimen de Extincion de Dominio), after a similar bill had failed to pass through Congress for two years. The asset forfeiture program allows authorities to investigate the origins of assets owned by suspected criminals in a process that runs parallel to a criminal investigation. If the owner of the assets cannot justify how they were paid for, they can be seized even before a conviction is secured. Under the decree, cases involving crimes such as drug trafficking, corruption, organized crime, terrorism and people trafficking would be liable to asset seizure. Authorities can look at crimes that go back as far as 20 years. The Loza clan's assets were seized after 12 members of the group were arrested last December and charged with crimes that included drug trafficking and money laundering in Argentina. Others members of the organization are under investigation in Spain and Italy. The clan ran a sophisticated cocaine trafficking ring involving drug producers in Peru and Bolivia, corrupt customs officials in Argentina, and a drug distribution network in Spain and other European countries. Authorities said the organization was particularly efficient at laundering millions of dollars in illegal earnings through the purchase of hundreds of luxury properties and vehicles in a number of countries. In principle, asset forfeiture hurts crime groups the most where they can least afford it: their wallets. Asset forfeiture has helped in the dismantling of mafias and drug organizations, allowing authorities to confiscate cash or property obtained through illicit means. But critics say asset forfeiture laws are often too broad and poorly implemented. Even though these policies are relatively new in Latin America, at least a dozen countries have similar laws in place and others are either considering or in the process of implementing them. Argentine prosecutors have said that the asset forfeiture decree is essential, as it can help shorten often lengthy criminal processes. Critics, however, say it creates a parallel investigation, where the accused is forced to prove they are innocent, which runs counter to Argentina's constitution. Establishing ownership of assets is also difficult, which could lead to the forfeiture of money or property without criminal ties. In addition, asset seizures in Argentina could be used for political retribution, as many high-level politicians are facing corruption charges and the country's judiciary is confronting much criticism. Authorities assure this will not happen, but a strong, independent oversight mechanism is needed to provide as much transparency as possible to the process. This type of mechanism, however, is not being considered. Asset forfeiture laws have also been abused. In the United States, civil forfeiture laws allowed cash-strapped police departments to add seized assets to their budgets. This provided an incentive for police to confiscate money, cars and homes from people who were later convicted of only minor crimes. Latin American countries have also struggled with government red tape and a lack of consensus when it comes to the use of funds from asset seizures. In Mexico, for example, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has proposed creating a new government body to allocate seized funds to education, sports and other social programs. But questions remain as to whether this plan is realistic. In Argentina, officials have placed an emphasis on the amount of cash and property to be seized, as opposed to what exactly authorities will do with the money.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Paraguay Currency Exchanges Launder Vast Amounts of Brazil Drug Money. Brazilian criminal gangs were able to use official currency exchanges in Paraguay to launder over $1.5 billion in drug money, showing how the country continues to be a paradise for organized crime groups seeking to hide their profits. An investigation in early August by Brazilian police in the city of Foz do Iguacu revealed that four gangs managed to launder 6.5 billion reais (around $1.5 billion) and use it to pay for a wide range of contraband goods, especially cigarettes and drugs acquired in Paraguay between 2010 and 2018. The gangs created bank accounts with fake identification or through ghost companies to deposit large amounts of money, according to the police statement. The gangs used a network of currency exchanges inside Paraguay. These would certify the money in reais had been deposited and then deliver the equivalent amount in US dollars to Paraguayan suppliers, thus legalizing the ""dirty"" money. To make this sophisticated operation work, the exchange houses used ""black dollars,"" legal US tender which circulates in the country parallel to the currency officially registered with the Central Bank of Paraguay while maintaining the same value. Official currency exchanges being used to launder over $1.5 billion with impunity will do nothing to improve Paraguay's reputation as a money-laundering hub. The government is seemingly unable or unwilling to bring money laundering to heel despite Paraguay having faced accusations as serious as helping the likes of Hezbollah launder funds. The success of these four Brazilian gangs, who were not all acting together, was at least partially based on lax controls within Paraguay's money laundering supervision body, Seprelad. It was only in late July that the country's central bank began demanding that currency exchanges track and record the origin of funds used in their cross-border operations. Worse, Paraguay's leadership has sometimes seemed to pride itself on its lack of fiscal controls. Speaking at the 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos, President Mario Abdo Benitez called his country ""almost a fiscal paradise."" The continued boom in the cross-border illegal cigarette trade is another sign of institutional apathy towards this black market. Former president Horacio Cartes has been repeatedly linked to the sale of illegal cigarettes in Brazil and across Latin America. This problem is beginning to have a serious impact on Brazil. This investigation was carried out by Brazilian police against Brazilian gangs, but as long as Paraguay refuses to crack down on money laundering, it will remain a convenient staging point for its neighbor's criminal groups to hide their loot."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Colombia Drug Mules Swallowing Dirty Money for Transport. Authorities in Colombia dismantled several international money laundering organizations that employed human drug mules who swallowed dirty money for transport from Mexico, providing further details on the relationship between criminal organizations in both countries. In joint operations carried out between Colombia's National Police and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) in the cities of Bogota, Medellin, Bucaramanga, Manizales, Pereira and Neiva, authorities arrested 27 suspected members of four transnational money launder organizations for transporting money from Mexico into the South American nation. The money was disguised in latex capsules and digested, Colombia's Attorney General's Office announced December 6. Each of the latex capsules had at least five $100 dollar bills inside. On average, one individual can consume between 80 and 120 capsules, transporting close to $40,000, according to authorities. Larger individuals can carry up to $75,000 in their bodies. Authorities say that Mexican cartels used the so-called ""mules"" to send money to Colombian criminal groups they're working with to traffic cocaine. The alleged leader of one of the networks, Wilmar Hernandez Sanchez, alias ""Pinocho"" or ""Profe,"" was among those arrested in the operation. Authorities say he's made some 250 trips between Colombia and Mexico. The head of one of the other dismantled networks -- who made 180 trips to Mexico, Ecuador, Chile, El Salvador, Peru and the United States to move more than 10 billion pesos (around $3 million) since 2015 -- recruited informal workers or unemployed individuals to travel to other countries to transport up to $10,000 back to Colombia in each trip, the limit allowed by Colombia's National Directorate of Taxes and Customs (DIAN). The recent bust in Colombia further demonstrates the links between Mexico's drug cartels and Colombia's criminal groups, and suggests that these groups are looking for new ways to transport their criminal proceeds as cocaine production soars to levels never seen before in the country's history. Criminal groups in Colombia and Mexico have had a strategic drug trafficking partnership for decades. But after the demobilization of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) in 2016 followed by the gradual decline of the Urabenos, the Mexicans have had to forge new alliances. As a result, Mexican criminal groups are establishing more of a presence in the country to inspect cocaine production and ensure quality. In 2016, the son of jailed Sinaloa Cartel kingpin Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias ""El Chapo,"" visited the city of Medellin protected by the Oficina de Envigado crime group in part to oversee two cocaine labs in the city's rural outskirts. The bust also suggests an evolution in techniques used to transport drug proceeds. Criminal groups throughout Latin America have long employed mules who swallow drugs like cocaine for transport into other countries. The region's criminal groups may now be using the same technique to transport their dirty cash back home."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Money Laundering Links Honduras, Panama and US. Two Honduran executives allegedly used a Panamanian business and a US bank to pay $2.5 million in bribes, suggesting that banks based in Panama and the United States may be involved in one of the biggest corruption cases in Honduras. Oscar Lainez and Jorge Herrera, executives of Compania de Servicios Multiples S. de R.L. (Cosem), allegedly used a Panamanian firm called CA Technologies to make transfers of more than $2.5 million to a JP Morgan Chase bank account in the United States belonging to a company called CM Motors, according to an investigation by the National Fiscal Support Unit (Unidad Nacional de Apoyo Fiscal). Mario Zelaya -- former director of the Honduran Social Security Institute (Instituto Hondureno de Seguridad Social - IHSS) who has been jailed and is facing charges in the IHSS case -- and his brother Carlos, are both partners of CM Motors. According to La Prensa , the Cosem executives paid these bribes in 2010 in order to ""expedite"" a $19.7 million contract with the IHSS to digitalize their registration system. The bribes were paid to then-Director Mario Zelaya, then-Vice Minister of Health Javier Pastor, and then-Deputy Secretary of Jobs Carlos Montes. Cosem executives Lainez and Herrera are both key witnesses in the money laundering and bribery case against Zelaya, Pastor and Montes. Raul Pineda Alvarado, a lawyer and expert in criminal law who spoke to La Prensa, told the media outlet the United States could take legal action against Lainez or Herrera, or place sanctions on JP Morgan. The announcement of this investigation comes at an awkward time for Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who is readying his bid for re-election. In 2015, the Honduran Supreme Court controversially overturned a constitutional ban on re-election, allowing Hernandez to run for another term as president. While Hernandez was not in office when Mario Zelaya and several of his colleagues from the IHSS were arrested and charged, the case impacts his National Party and could impact his reelection bid. Hernandez admitted in 2015 that companies linked to corruption cases in the IHSS had contributed nearly $150,000 to his presidential campaign in 2013. As Honduran authorities investigated corruption within IHSS, they discovered ""the creation of over 10 ghost companies that allegedly delivered checks and wired monthly installments to the National Party's central committee."" As further revelations surface regarding corruption in the IHSS, details could emerge that may prove damaging to Hernandez's re-election bid."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Uruguay Anti-Money Laundering Chief Targets Churches and NGOs. Uruguay's anti-money laundering chief has called for greater oversight of religious groups and non-governmental organizations, fearing organized crime to take advantage of current lax regulations. During an anti-corruption conference on March 25, Carlos Diaz, director of Uruguay's Anti-Money Laundering Secretariat, emphasized the necessity to revise financial controls over the country's more than 15,000 social organizations -- including sports clubs, political parties, and churches -- saying they should be subject to the same oversight as institutions such as real estate or auctioneers, reported El Pais. Diaz said the emergence of ""a new world"" of money laundering has led to a need for the adoption of fresh measures, citing concerns over the presence of groups like the Italian mafias the Cosa Nostra and 'Ndrangheta in the area and saying Uruguay needs to avoid religious institutions -- which are tax exempt -- being converted into financers of ""terrorist acts."" According to El Espectador , Diaz said that despite Uruguay not being a large drug market, it still faced a threat from organized crime because of the money laundering possibilities its financial system presents. Diaz mentioned two past examples of a Sinaloa Cartel operative and the family member of a Colombian president attempting to launder money through the country. This is not the first time calls have arisen for increased oversight of Uruguay's non-governmental organizations (NGOs), with an anti-money laundering plan adopted in 2012 including a provision for more stringent controls. According to a US State Department report , Uruguay's highly dollarized economy -- with the US dollar often used as a business currency -- makes it vulnerable to money laundering. The report cites transnational organized crime, especially that originating in Brazil, to be of concern. Uruguay has a zero-tax policy for foreigners, which attracts a host of international bodies and NGOs to bank in the country. Over the past two decades, Uruguay's banking sector has also been bolstered by the rollercoaster economy of neighbor Argentina, with Argentines pulling money out of their homeland during times of economic distress and investing it in Uruguay, among other countries. The combination of zero tax, lax oversight and a strong banking sector with safe investor prospects is extremely attractive to organized criminal elements looking to launder illicit funds. Argentina is also another prominent venue for money laundering, with tensions breaking out between the two neighbors in September 2013 over apparent hurdles encountered by Uruguayan investigators of a money laundering case that stretched between the two nations."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"El Salvador to Create New Money Laundering Police Unit. El Salvador's government has approved the creation of a police unit to combat financial crimes, a welcome move in one the region's most attractive money laundering locations, but one unlikely to see results unless coupled with serious attempts to tackle corruption. Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes signed a decree creating a Financial Crimes Division of the national police, which will target money laundering operations and funds linked to drug trafficking, according to a government press release. The same decree will separate the administrative and operative departments of the police, with the goal of increasing the body's efficiency. Funes also plans to send a bill to the Legislative Assembly in coming days which, if approved, will serve to regulate the use of funds seized from criminals, allocating some of this money to the budget of the Security and Justice Ministry, reported La Pagina. According to the US government, El Salvador's dollarized economy and location in the middle of the cocaine trail leading from South America to the United States make it an ideal money laundering spot for transnational drug traffickers and other criminal groups. Drug trafficking groups like the Texis Cartel have until recently operated in the country with relative impunity , and Salvadoran police have said the money laundering structures of this group are a more important target than the drugs themselves. The country already has an investigative money laundering unit attached to the Public Ministry, but the unit has been largely ineffective, with just four sentences handed down to money launderers between 2010 and 2013 -- the lowest number in Central America, along with Costa Rica. In this context, the creation of a financial crimes police unit could be an important step in combating money laundering. However, the unit will likely face an uphill battle, as to be successful it will have to target official corruption. The case of drug transporter Jorge Ulloa Sibrian, alias ""Repollo,"" captured in March, highlighted the ties between the state and drug traffickers in El Salvador and officials' willingness to ignore these links."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Trans Women: The Unseen Victims of Human Trafficking. Sharon welcomes us to her home in the baking jungle of Pucallpa. She wears sandals and a long dress with her hair tied back. She has finished serving dinner to her family and invites us into the yard, away from prying ears. She tells us how, at just 20 years old, she has already escaped human traffickers twice. Back in October 2014, she was just 16 when her life changed. Her parents had begun to accept her trans identity, and she was looking for new ways to bring money home -- other than prostitution. When a woman offered her a job as a cashier in a bar in Huanuco, eight hours from her hometown, she leapt at the opportunity. But when she got to the bar, they locked her up, dressed her as a man and offered her up to customers looking for beer and sex. Violence and Slavery ""The police raided us and pushed us outside. They left me in a men's shelter with nothing but my clothes. My dad had to go and get me out. We found the owner of the bar, but she wouldn't pay me the salary she owed me."" Police and judicial records of the raid on October 23, 2014, show that ""acts against morality"" were recorded on the premises but nothing identifies Sharon as a victim. *This article was originally published by Ojo Publico. It was translated, edited for clarity and reprinted with permission, but does not necessarily reflect the views of InSight Crime. See the original version in Spanish here. Sharon's mother hugs her between photographs and asks if she's eaten enough. The second time Sharon was taken, her mother felt she was to blame. An adult trans woman, well-known in the neighborhood, promised to take Sharon to work as her assistant at a beauty salon in Argentina. All her mother had to do was sign the travel permit. The journey was over land and seemed to last forever. They stopped over in Lima and passed through Santiago de Chile before reaching the city of La Plata, near Buenos Aires. And Sharon's body already had a price when she arrived: a year and a half as a prostitute to pay for the trip. She was there six months before her mother raised the money to buy her return ticket. ""That neighbor still comes back to the neighborhood, but she doesn't say anything to me because she knows I can defend myself,"" Sharon says. The Road to Exploitation In this report, we document the vulnerabilities that surround the lives of trans adolescents and adults when they leave their homes, whether to simply express their sexual identity or whether they are driven out by violence from their families, and how this uprooting makes them easy targets for human trafficking or the child sex trade. The main route for this kind of exploitation runs through the Peruvian jungle to Lima, then continues into countries such as Argentina and Italy. However, the full nature of this violence eludes most victims because they believe it is the price to pay for being who they are. Requests were sent for public information to the national police, the Ministry for Women and Vulnerable Populations (Ministerio de la Mujer y Poblaciones Vulnerables - MIMP), the Attorney General's Office and the court system to find out how many LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex) minors and adults have been rescued from sexual exploitation and human trafficking, how many were granted government protection and which cases resulted in legal action. Figures show that in 2017 alone police freed 725 people from trafficking, the Attorney General's Office had 1,464 cases underway and the MIMP admitted seven at-risk women. But it is unknown how many of the alleged victims belong to the LGBTI population because the government registration system is binary, meaning it only allows victims to be classified as male or female. Appealing to the memory of the officials who handled the cases is the only way to learn a victim's LGBTI status. Because of such oversights, stories like Sharon's become invisible, disappearing into statistical data that does not recognize the existence of trans people. To reconstruct these cases, we contacted the eight prosecutors specializing in human trafficking -- assigned to eight regions in Peru for the past two years -- as well as the 24 organized crime prosecutor's offices, which operate nationally. Only in Lima's human trafficking office were we able to confirm four investigations in progress involving transgender minors or adults alleged to have been trafficking victims. Meanwhile, the central region of Junin has no records. There is no judicial process for victims such as Otilia. ""I filed the complaint by choice. They've done nothing, absolutely nothing,"" she told us. We went to the same square in Pucallpa where, three years ago, a woman approached Otilia to buy some food. At the time, she was working as a street vendor selling food out of a wheelbarrow. The woman praised Otilia's cooking and offered her a job as a cook in her restaurant. She accepted and left home. Her journey took her to the Valley of the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro rivers (Valle de los rios Apurimac, Ene y Mantaro - VRAEM), an area known for extreme poverty and a high incidence of terrorism and drug trafficking. ""I was locked up for a year and eight months, without seeing the light of day, without a good night's sleep. The woman fed me like a dog. It was a bar, and she wanted me to sell my body. I never did it. I refused and locked myself in the kitchen. Maybe she locked me up because I was a faggot or because I didn't want to work. I escaped through a window. I broke it. Nothing mattered to me anymore. I told the police everything, but they didn't believe me,"" she said. But a woman who sold lunches in a village in Junin's Pangoa district did believe her. She gave her a job washing dishes, and after four months Otilia earned enough money to return home. Her family had already given her up for dead. And the complaint she filed with the Junin police department? It never made it to the human trafficking prosecutor's office. IQUITOS, LORETO The Amazonian city of Iquitos houses a robust tourism industry thanks to its location and the neighborhood of Belen, known as the Venice of the Amazon. But it is also the first stop for many girls and trans adolescents poverty or violence in their native communities around the region of Loreto. The first leg of their trip can often only be completed after or days of travel by boat. ""K"" left her native village of Tamshiyacu, on the bank of the Amazon River, at the age of 12, weeks after she was diagnosed with HIV. It was at this young age that she had to decide whether to continue living in a conservative, religious community where transgender people and HIV are believed to be the work of the devil and antiretroviral treatment is scarce. ""Finding out (she was HIV-positive) was the most difficult thing that ever happened to me,"" she said. Today, she is 23 and has still not told her parents of her diagnosis, which is why she does not want to share her real name. According to Ximena Salazar, an anthropologist at the Cayetano Heredia Peruvian University, trans people begin to reveal their identity between 10 and 13 years old. At that age, they usually have no documents and no means of financial support, have not completed their education, and leave home because their families have rejected them or they seek a place where they can come to terms with their gender identity. Their migratory journey is clandestine and often marred by violence, persecution, discrimination and denial of their human and civil rights. These circumstances make them high vulnerable to traffickers and others who would exploit them. Chriss is also from Tamshiyacu and arrived at Iquitos at the same age as K. She had not even completed primary school. She and her parents were eventually able to resolve their initial rejection of her gender identity, and they all live under the same roof. Chriss helps to care for her siblings, nieces and nephews with the money she earns as a prostitute. At 23 years old, she wants to go to Italy because she has heard that other trans women earn more money there, perhaps enough to buy homes for their families. Carlobi Rios, coordinator of the Trans Network (Red Trans) in Loreto, acknowledges that girls willingly go to Italy and Argentina to prostitute themselves, but most of them are not warned that they will be forced to sell drugs or to steal to pay for their travel and accommodation costs. ""It brings in more profits. And do you think they can say refuse,"" she asks. Older trans women or ""mothers"" often front the money for the trips. Other times it may be criminals who control several girls at a time, even deceiving them into believing they are a couple. But, again, the Loreto police department does not identify trans victims. Prostitution is not illegal in Peru, but facilitating or profiting from the sexual activity of a third party falls under laws banning aiding and abetting, procurement and pimping. Peru's criminal code also includes the more serious crimes of sexual exploitation -- forcing someone to perform sexual acts in exchange for money -- and human trafficking. Victims often become dependent on their captors and ultimately submit. ""The mother feeds you or protects you from being beaten, but in return she uses your body to make money. The 'husband' lives off of us, beats us, harasses us, and we don't say anything because we think it's normal. The girls don't think it's exploitation, trafficking or abuse. You could make them sleep on the floor, and they'd be grateful because they don't know anything else. We've entered a cycle of normalized violence,"" explains Miluska Luzquino, director of nonprofit organization Peru Trans Network (Red Trans Peru), which defends the rights of trans people. Of all the members of the LGBTI population, trans people have the least opportunity to escape from this cycle. A 2016 survey of 118 trans women across six regions of Peru, by the organization No Tengo Miedo (I Have No Fear), found that 38% had not completed elementary or secondary school and 50.8% had no medical insurance of any kind. Nor do they have national identification documents. In some cases, they may choose not to obtain or renew them as because they know it will not reflect the gender they identify as. Without family, school or a workplace that accepts them, trans people survive in a world of exclusion. In 2016 Peru's Congress introduced Bill 790, supported by the Peru Trans Network. If passed, it would allow trans people to modify the name and gender that appears on their national identification. It would also enact measures to stop discrimination and support their access to decent work. However, the bill has been languishing in the legislature's Women and Family Commission since December 2016. Lima: Transit Point and Shelter Area Behind a church in the center of Peru's capital city, the night keeps the sexual exploitation of trans people well hidden. Slaves of the Sacred Heart (Esclavas del Sagrado Corazon) is the name of the church that stands less than a block from Tacna Avenue, Lima's major artery leading to its historic center. The church's walls also reach Washington Street, where dozens of transsexual prostitutes speak of violence and the violation rights they did not know they had. Many of the trans people along Washington prostitute themselves without pimps because the last one who operated there was arrested eight months ago. Only by striking up a conversation with them could we learn who migrated to Lima from other cities like Iquitos, Pucallpa, Chiclayo and Trujillo in their adolescence, whether in the footsteps of an older trans person or with a false boyfriend whom they ultimately paid back for the protection or love they were promised through prostitution. Only 15 years old, Daleska says no one is exploiting her, but she knows what is happening. ""People like me, or younger, fall in love with a man, but he only sees money. He sees that he can make money because of their age or maybe because they're pretty. The emotional blackmail attached to our sexuality is normal because we feel lonely, because we never had affection, because they throw us out. So they blackmail you. They do what they want with you, and the only thing left is to obey and give them the money. They buy them clothes and let them live off of them."" Daleska migrated from Chiclayo, a city on Peru's northern coast, at the age of 13. She lives with other trans people in some of downtown Lima's old mansions, in cubicles measuring two square meters for $10 a night. The only thing she has from her past are two childhood photographs. In its report Trafficking in Persons , the US State Department warns that LGBTI people -- especially those who are trans -- are susceptible to every type of vulnerability linked to sex trafficking. Since 2015 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) has recommended improving victim identification procedures and adapting assistance services to meet the needs of such vulnerable groups. But in Peru, the Investigative Division Against Human Trafficking (Division de Investigacion contra la Trata de Personas - DIVINTRAP) does not investigate who belongs to the LGBTI population, nor does it keep tabs on where they are. ""We're waiting for this vulnerable population to come to us in order to know what problems they're going through and, from there, establish different strategies. We have trained personnel, and we ask them to trust the police,"" stated DIVINTRAP head Colonel Antonio Capa. But Luzquino maintains that the only relationship the trans population has with the Peruvian authorities -- especially the local police -- is violence. In the most extreme cases, water hoses have been used to throw them out onto the streets, beat them, or abandon them in vacant lots. They have also insisted on treating trans women as males and made fun of them when they accuse their partners of assault. The rejection of trans people by local authorities is so severe that 11 of Lima's 43 municipalities include the ""eradication of homosexuals"" or ""transvestites"" in their public security plans. The Attorney-General's Office is the only institution in Peru to have included the LGBTI option in its registration system, when entering data about the victim of a crime. For Para Rosario Lopez Wong, the head of the Assistance to Victims and Witnesses Bureau (Udavit), that is where the invisibility of these victims begins. Reversing this process is crucial; not only for trans people but the entire LGBTI community, and will have no effect if other institutions do not follow suit. ""We need to show that we can apply drastic sanctions to traffickers who take advantage of the discrimination and exclusion suffered by transgender people. This is a challenge because it is difficult for this group to understand that their dignity has been violated, ""explains Wong. The current National Plan against Trafficking in Persons 2017-2021, dedicates, for the first time, a few paragraphs to the LGBTI population. It recognizes their vulnerability and the difficulty they have in ""accessing protection and care services, creating a double victimization."" The plan states that LGBTI people have full rights as victims of human trafficking but includes no plans or measures to ensure this happens. ""How do you denounce the disappearance and exploitation of a trans person?"" asked Luzquino. Any missing persons poster would likely bear a name and photo that do not correspond to reality. In most cases, there is no identity document to track them. Relatives may not be worried about their absence, ignoring the fact that they are potentially trapped in sexual slavery. ""We practically do not exist,"" the activist replied. These are silent victims, yet authorities expect them to speak up first. *This article was originally published by Ojo Publico.

"Brazil Case Shows Judicial Officials Complicit in Illegal Adoptions. A high-level official in Brazil accused judicial officials in his country of complicity in illegal adoptions, highlighting the endemic corruption that facilitates human trafficking in that country and across the region. The head of the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry (CPI) on Human Trafficking, Arnaldo Jordy, said that he was certain judicial officials were involved in a case involving the allegedly illegal adoption of five children in Monte Santo in the Bahia department in Brazil's northeast, reported Jornal do Brasil. In June 2011, Judge Vitor Xavier Bizerra authorized the adoption of the five children , all from the same family, by four couples in Sao Paulo, apparently without the consent of the biological parents. According to the children's mother, Silvania Maria da Silva, she received a judicial order to give her children up for adoption, and police forcibly took them away, telling the parents if they intervened they would be arrested, O Globo reported. Following investigations and a local court order, the children were returned to their parents in December 2012. Jordy said that, although he was not certain of Bizerra's involvement, irregularities in the judicial process leading up to the adoption point to the courts' complicity in the case. He said the commission is awaiting a report from the National Justice Council (CNJ) regarding the case, which will help it determine the degree of judicial participation. Following a visit to Monte Santo with the CPI, Government Minister Francisco Falcao said that he did not believe the case was isolated, and that the ""recurrence of accusations"" suggested the existence of a market in illegal adoptions. Jordy also noted that the country's child protection laws are ""obsolete"" and expressed the need for a greater federal police presence in the region. Brazil recently announced plans to implement a three-year, $3 million plan to combat human trafficking, part of which calls for a revised penal code that would stiffen penalties for illegal adoptions. However, fighting the kind of embedded corruption that appears to be linked to this case may be difficult in a country where much of the population believes the judiciary to be slow and dishonest , and there is little confidence in the police. The Brazilian case is just one of many similar cases of illegal adoption and child trafficking in the region. In 2012, a child trafficking ring was discovered in Guadalajara, Mexico, which allegedly paid mothers to put their children up for adoption. Government officials were accused of involvement in the scheme. Peru and Guatemala are two other countries with a documented illegal adoption market. Since 2007, Guatemala has significantly reduced the number of adoptions as it continues to reform its institutions and laws on this issue."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Victims Survey Highlights Under-reporting of Crime. A self-reported survey of crime victims in Mexico in 2013 shows a similar upward trend to government statistics, but on a much larger scale, pointing to the huge number of crimes that go unreported. The ENVIPE 2014 survey was conducted by Mexico's national statistics agency INEGI between March and April this year, using a sample of nearly 100,000 households. Based on the survey results, INEGI estimated that in 10.7 million households in Mexico (33.9 percent of the total) at least one member of the household was the victim of crime in 2013, or some 22.5 million people -- a rate of 28,224 victims per 100,000 residents. These figures represent a slight increase from 2012 , when the 32.4 percent of households were affected, and the victimization rate was 27,337 per 100,000. The states where the most notable upticks in victimization rates occurred (see map) were Chiapas (30 percent increase), Coahuila (23 percent) and Tlaxcala (20.8 percent). Rates dropped by more than 15 percent in Chihuahua, Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon, and stayed fairly stable in the embattled states of Guerrero and Michoacan. The most commonly cited crime (not including homicide or kidnapping) was street robbery (29.6 percent of the total), followed by extortion (23.6 percent). The frequency of all crimes except car theft and personal injury increased between 2012 and 2013, while more than 120,000 people were estimated to have been victims of kidnapping in 2013 -- up from around 94,000 in 2012. Perceptions of insecurity also rose: in 2012, 66.6 percent of citizens considered their state unsafe; in 2013, this figure rose to 72.3 percent. MEXICO VICTIMIZATION RATES PER 100,000 RESIDENTS (IN THOUSANDS), 2013 Source: INEGI 2014 victimization survey (ENVIPE) INEGI's most recent survey highlights the shortcomings of Mexico's official crime figures, which are also called into question by the fact that national statistics show that homicides are dropping as other crimes increase. The pattern seen in the survey is largely in keeping with official statistics from Mexico's National Public Security Secretariat (SNSP), which also show a rise in kidnappings and extortion in 2013 (although they indicate robberies dropped). However, the survey suggests that a huge proportion of crimes in Mexico are never reported -- INEGI estimates that in 2013 more than 90 percent of crimes were not reported, while almost 94 percent were not investigated. This gap is known as the ""cifra negra."" The extent of under-reporting can be seen particularly with kidnappings: INEGI estimates that more than 130,000 occurred in 2013, while the SNSP recorded just 1,698. Another point of interest is that two states where the victimization rate dropped or stayed stable between 2012 and 2013 according to ENVIPE -- Tamaulipas and Guerrero -- saw spikes in both kidnapping and extortion in 2013, according to national figures."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Honduras Military Police Accused of Kidnapping. Four low-ranking military police officers in Honduras were arrested on kidnapping charges, prompting a swift response from the president who wants to enshrine the force into the Constitution. The four officers strong-armed a local businessman into their car, telling him he was under arrest, but that they would let him go for about $5,700, reported El Heraldo. A relative of the businessman followed the cops in another vehicle and reported the crime to the city police force, who detained the four officers. In the video below, the kidnap victim -- who reportedly owns a fruit stand -- described his ordeal to a local TV station. President Juan Orlando Hernandez addressed the incident on social media, tweeting that ""justice must apply to everyone equally,"" and that ""whoever it may be, he who commits a crime must be judged."" LA JUSTICIA DEDE APLICARSE A TODOS POR IGUAL, ASI SEAN POLICIAS, MILITARES, EMPRESARIOS, POLITICOS O CIUDADANOS COMUNES. -- Juan Orlando H.

(JuanOrlandoH) February 12, 2015 The president is a strong backer of the military police, which were created while a member of Congress in 2013 and currently consists of about 3,000 officers. But earlier this year, Congress rejected an initiative that would have made the force part of Honduran constitutional law. Orlando is now trying to drum up support for a proposed referendum that would allow the public to vote on the issue in November. His Twitter feed includes multiple photos of crowds alongside captions describing ""public support"" for the military police.

(JuanOrlandoH) February 8, 2015 The government is arguably aware of criticism that it has militarized its security strategy to the detriment of human rights. This helps explain why President Orlando is so determined to eliminate the risk that a future government should dissolve the military police -- and getting the force protected by the Constitution is a surefire way to do this. So far, authorities have described this kidnapping case involving military police as a few bad apples. But should more systematic abuse come to light, the president may face the most serious challenge yet to his proposed referendum. The creation of the military police formed part of efforts to clean up Honduras' badly corrupt national police force, which has participated in extortion , contract killings, and other crimes."	0	1	0	0	1	0	0
"FARC Run Marijuana Cartel. The rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) have become the principal dealers of marijuana in the country, diversifying from cocaine, according to experts. An article in the newspaper El Colombiano outlined the FARC 's increasing involvement in the marijuana trade, especially along the Pacific Coast. The biggest seizure of the year was ten tons of marijuana found in the eastern province of Meta in October, property of the FARC's 26th Front. However the majority of seizures are between one and four tons, and occur along the Pacific seaboard, especially in the department of Cauca, a marijuana-growing center. Cauca saw three tons decommissioned in August and on December 27, after fighting with FARC rebels another ton was uncovered. Both of these seizures were traced back to the FARC's 6th Front, which controls much of the area where the drug crops are grown and supplies the local market in the nearby city of Cali. While not as lucrative as cocaine, marijuana can be easily sold on the domestic market, ensuring that the FARC's cash flow is constant and avoiding the need to change narco-dollars into Colombian pesos. Much of the marijuana trade is controlled by the FARC's Joint Western Command, under Jorge Torres Victoria, alias ""Pablo Catatumbo,"" which has presence in the departments of Narino, Cauca, Valle del Cauca, and into Tolima. This is now one of the most militarily active FARC Blocs or fighting divisions with plenty of money thanks to income from cocaine, heroin and now marijuana. Domestic consumption of many types of illegal drugs is growing in Colombia and with it urban violence has increased over the last two years. This is partly due to the successful dismantling of several international cartels which exported drugs, and improved interdiction. This means that while drug production remains relatively steady, less is being exported, leading to a saturation of local markets, which is feeding domestic consumption and the rise of street gangs and urban violence.

"Mexico Pirates Target New Treasure: Shrimp. Heavily armed pirates have been hijacking shrimp catches along Mexico's Pacific Coast, perhaps the work of cartel gunmen with time on their hands, or a sign of an interruption in cocaine shipments. According to an investigation by El Universal , around $800,000 of shrimp has been stolen from shrimpers working off the coast of the state of Sinaloa following 14 robberies during the 2013 to 2014 shrimp season -- an almost five-fold increase on the three robberies reported during the 2012 to 2013 season. The pirates using go-fast boats to ambush the shrimping vessels at sea and are equipped with bullet proof vests and assault rifles. Raul Benitez Manaut, an investigator at Mexico's National Autonomous University, said the breakdown in the Sinaloa Cartel after the recent captures of important leaders -- including boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman -- may be behind the increase in shrimp boat robberies and that the problem will likely escalate. He warned that authorities need to ensure that these robberies do not ""begin to be become modus operandi"" for armed cells within the drug cartels. According to Benitez, a shrimp price increase of 30 to 40 percent has led to it being labeled ""blue gold"" and may also explain the rise in robberies. This appears not to be an isolated example. In Honduras it is estimated nearly 3.5 million pounds of shrimp -- about $10 million worth -- are stolen each year, according to the National Aquaculture Association of Honduras. The equipment and methods used to carry out these crimes -- speedboats and military-grade weaponry -- suggest the robbers are highly organized. It is unlikely they were formed to rob shrimp catches, but rather worked for the drug trade. Criminal organizations often move cocaine via maritime routes along both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts, using go-fast boats, submarines, yachts and fishing vessels, or a mix of them all. The shipments often travel with their own protection and also employ local fisherman as drivers and watchmen, or to bring drugs to shore. Such ties have often brought drug violence to fishing towns and islands, including Nicaragua's Bluefields , Colombia's San Andres island , islands off Panama's coasts , and Ecuador's province of Manabi. Mexico has drug cartels using both its Gulf and Pacific coasts. With the increasing fragmentation of the large international drug cartels , criminal organizations often subcontract out select jobs along the drug chain to local criminal groups, with transportation being one of them. It is quite possible that, as security services operations have disrupted the flow of drugs, one or more groups dedicated to trafficking along the Sinaloa coast could be using their knowledge of the seas, and fishing practices, to make up for lost profits. If so, this would be just another example of the diversification of criminal portfolios away from a total reliance on drugs, to activities like extortion, kidnapping and now it seems, shrimp piracy."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Laguna Cartel Blamed for Attack on Mexico Newspaper. Authorities arrested nine alleged members of one of Mexico's newer criminal organizations, the so-called Laguna Cartel, who stand accused of attacking the building of local newspaper El Siglo de Torreon in Coahuila state. As Proceso reported , the operation -- carried out last week -- represents another blow to the recently formed criminal group, following the arrest of another 21 alleged members who were apprehended in March. These detainees were also charged with attacking the newspaper, as well as the murder of Mario Alberto Landeros Campero, a mayoral candidate in the city of Lerdo. El Siglo de Torreon has suffered numerous attacks this year , including three seperate assaults against the newspaper building and the kidnapping of five journalists in February. Little is known about the Laguna Cartel, but it is believed to be made up mainly of former members of the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO), and is currently at war with the Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas over the Lagunera region that includes the cities of Gomez Palacio, Durango, and Torreon, Coahuila. Along with the 21 alleged members who were arrested in March, the group's purported leader, Edgar Yurem Moreno Vasquez, was captured by Mexican authorities in early May. The fact that the attacks against El Siglo resulted in a wave of arrests is a sign of progress, as most crimes against the media in Mexico go unsolved and often not investigated. It's well documented that Mexico continues to be one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists , and at least 45 media workers have been killed since 2006. Self-censorship has become a common practice within Mexican newsrooms, as not reporting on organized crime has frequently been the only option for keeping media employees safe. In order to combat the rise of attacks against the free press, President Enrique Pena Nieto approved legislation that will give federal authorities stronger jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed against media workers.	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
"Ayotzinapa: What Four Years of Impunity Say About Security In Mexico. The unsolved disappearance of 43 students from a rural teachers college in Mexico four years ago put the level of collusion between the country's organized crime groups and security forces on stark display , but questions remain as to whether the incoming administration will be able to tackle it. On the evening of September 26, 2014, 43 students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College disappeared in the city of Iguala in the western state of Guerrero. A few months later, in January 2015, the administration of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said that police in Iguala had arrested the students and handed them over to a local crime group known as the Guerrero Unidos. One of the group's leaders later testified that he ordered the students to be killed and their bodies later burned in a trash dump in the nearby town of Cocula, a version of events that investigations conducted by independent experts have cast serious doubt on. One theory as to why the Guerreros Unidos would target a group of students says that one of the buses the students had taken to travel to a protest was allegedly carrying a heroin shipment, which ultimately prompted the deadly response from security forces and members of the criminal group. The investigation into the whereabouts of the 43 students has been marked by irregularities and mismanagement. A March 2018 United Nations report accused the Mexican government of fabricating evidence and torturing many of the individuals it arrested into confessing to involvement in the crime, in addition to trying to cover up these abuses. Shortly after winning the election in July, Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador requested an international team of experts to return to the country to continue an investigation largely dismissed by Pena Nieto and ordered the creation of a Truth and Justice Commission to reopen the case. The case of the missing 43 students will undeniably be Pena Nieto's darkest legacy as he leaves office and Lopez Obrador replaces him in December. But whether the incoming president will be able to both solve the case and effectively reform the security forces that so often help facilitate criminal activities in the country, remains to be seen. Aside from showcasing the Mexican government's inability, or unwillingness, to adequately investigate and handle crucial evidence in a high-profile investigation, the Ayotzinapa case also illustrates the depth of collusion between organized crime groups and security forces. As Mexican journalist Anabel Hernandez and her colleague Steve Fisher uncovered , drug traffickers associated with the Beltran Leyva Organization kept local and federal security forces in Iguala on their payroll, and ordered them to recover the shipment of heroin that was allegedly on the bus the students had taken that fateful night in September 2014. The students seem to have been caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Uncovering what happened to them would mean shining the spotlight on security forces' collusion with organized crime groups -- and the government turning a blind eye to it -- something that would have further contributed to the widespread disapproval of Pena Nieto's fight against crime and drug trafficking. In an effort to strengthen the institutions directly affected by organized crime, Lopez Obrador promises to ensure the county's police force is better-trained, better-paid and more professional. This is a welcome step as Mexico's police are largely overworked , underpaid and understaffed, which can at times leave them entirely dysfunctional and more susceptible to corruption and infiltration from organized crime groups. But while addressing the shortcomings within the police is needed, it likely won't entirely eliminate the corruption within these institutions that crime groups so often rely on to operate. ""It's not enough to just have a police force that is better trained and better equipped to fight organized crime,"" Christy Thornton, an assistant professor in sociology and Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins University, told InSight Crime. ""This doesn't take away the financial incentive for crime groups to move drugs through these areas, which comes from demand in the United States. As long as that incentive exists, crime groups will seek collusion from security forces or at least the guarantee that they'll look the other way."" As InSight Crime previously reported , Lopez Obrador will have to ""avoid grand solutions"" and instead focus on the many moving parts that impact Mexico's security situation if things are to improve. One of the most important places to start, according to Jaime Lopez, a security policy consultant and former Mexican police officer, is ""strengthening internal oversight mechanisms [within security forces] throughout the country."" So far, Lopez Obrador has failed to provide a concrete plan for how he might attempt to improve oversight mechanisms and other factors that could reduce levels of corruption within the country's security institutions. ""The new administration might be able to push for coordinated efforts in this direction, but it would take a much more detailed diagnosis and more specific strategies than what we have seen so far,"" Lopez added. Lopez Obrador seems to have the political will to find the answers that Pena Nieto's administration failed to regarding the 43 missing students, but rooting out the corruption within the country's security institutions that helped facilitate this egregious crime may prove to be a much harder task."	0	1	0	1	0	0	0
Corruption in El Salvador: Top Police Officials Used Fake Qualifications. El Salvador authorities knew 15 top police officials had allegedly used false qualifications to move up to career ladder but did nothing about it, highlighting the entrenched corruption and impunity that facilitates organized crime. The names of nine current commissioners, five chief inspectors and an inspector from the El Salvador National Police (PNC) appear in a 2001 Attorney General's office investigation into false qualifications obtained by newspaper El Mundo. The officials all obtained qualifications from universities later closed down for irregularities, including one that was found to be operating out of a private home with no classrooms, teachers, or students.They then used the qualifications to gain access to training programs and to allow them to increase their rank within the force. Among the fifteen are: Commissioner Hector Mendoza Cordero, the current Deputy Director of Investigations and a member of the National Disciplinary Tribunal, who has been accused of corruption and links to the Texis Cartel; Godofredo Adalberto Miranda Martinez, an advisor to the head of the PNC who has been accused of drug trafficking and links to the criminal group the Perrones; Angel Barquero Silva, a former local Interpol chief; and Marco Mariona Escalante, who currently occupies the highly sensitive role of head of the Telecommunications Interception Center. It is no secret that organized crime in El Salvador has close ties to the national police and that this corruption runs through the organization, from street level to top officials. What this case underscores is not that corruption exists but the scale of the challenge faced by those looking to uproot it. The officials were identified as fraud suspects as early as 2001, yet instead of facing further investigation they have risen through the ranks unimpeded, reaching some of the highest and most sensitive posts in the El Salvador police. Along the way, many of them have become embroiled in serious scandals, related either to their personal conduct or their suspected criminal ties. However, these too have failed to provoke disciplinary action or be any obstacle to the men rising through the ranks. As long as such impunity remains characteristic of how the El Salvador police operate, then the institution's role as protector and facilitator of organized crime will continue.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexican Vigilantes Hand Captives over to State. A community police group in Mexico's Guerrero state has handed over a group of criminal suspects to the authorities, demonstrating their willingness to collaborate with the state as their legalization is debated. Armed vigilantes in Ayutla de los Libres, a municipality on Mexico's southern Pacific coast, handed over some 20 men and women who they had detained for over 50 days after accusing them of crimes such as extortion and kidnapping, Milenio reported. At least 22 other suspects, who were accused of minor crimes, were released after undergoing the vigilantes' ""re-education process,"" according to Animal Politico. The group released another 14 people earlier in February, and claim that they have no more prisoners. The director of local community police umbrella group the Union of the People and Organizations of the State of Guerrero (UPOEG), Bruno Placido Valerio, said they were giving the authorities the opportunity to punish the suspects, but that if the state releases them, the group would not hesitate to detain them again. The recent prisoner release comes as the legalization of self-defense groups is being debated by the federal government. El Universal reported that senators from the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) have proposed reforming the constitution to legalize and regulate the groups. Numerous armed community police units have recently sprung up across the ""Costa Chica"" region of Guerrero state, where drug trafficking has led to increased crime and violence. Over 800 civilians are believed to be involved in the groups. Community vigilante groups have been proliferating in Mexico , in a sign of the state's failure to provide security. As the groups develop, they have looked to establish ties with the authorities in some regions, including Guerrero, where self-defense forces have worked with political figures and the military. However, as the debate over legalizing community policing i ntensifies, there are serious concerns the groups could abuse their power, fueled by reports in January that a person had been executed by vigilantes. The dangers of legitimizing these groups are illustrated by the history of Colombia, which over the last few decades has been confronted with rampant violence resulting from both illegal vigilante groups -- such as the leftist militias that controlled Medellin's slums in the 1990s -- and legal groups -- such as the CONVIVIR community defense groups set up in the Antioquia province in the same period. There is inherent peril in vigilante groups cooperating with the security forces, especially in Mexico where the police and military are deeply infiltrated by criminal groups. In Colombia, legal paramilitary groups evolved into death squads, which often worked with the security forces to carry out the dirty work the legal agencies could not."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Drug Gang Declares Support for Anti-Violence Poet. A banner signed by Mexican drug gang the Beltran Leyva Organization claims that the group supports Javier Sicilia, a poet who has been campaigning for an end to drug violence after his son was found murdered. Since Juan Francisco Sicilia Ortega was found dead in March along with six friends, in a killing thought to be carried out by drug traffickers, his father has led massive protests joined by tens of thousands of people across Mexico. Javier Sicilia has also met with President Calderon to demand the government cease its war on drugs, which many say has made violence worse. The Gulf Cartel was at first blamed for the murders, but denied responsibility. The group handed over an individual to the authorities who reportedly confessed to the killings and admintted being part of a Beltran Leyva offshoot called the South Pacific cartel. Now the plot has thickened further, with the appearance of a banner in the city of Cuernavaca on Monday, El Proceso reports. The message, purportedly from the Beltran Leyva Organization, claims that the group has nothing to do with the murders. The text reads: Enough of blaming the Beltran Leyvas and innocent people for the dirty actions of the government [illegible] to the inspector general of the republic, Marisela Morales, and El Grande, Sergio Villarreal, who is her protected witness, they are colluding in the death of Javier Sicilia [sic] to blame the Beltran Leyva. Javier Sicilia can count on our support, the Beltran Leyvas do not kill innocent people, the South Pacific Cartel is an invention of El Grande and of El Negro Radilla, it belongs to El Grande and all the protected witnesses. Organized crime is the government, becuase they are untouchable. May the truth come to light!! 	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Venezuela with more than 21,600 murders in 2012: NGO. According to calculations made by a respected NGO, Venezuela is now far and away the most dangerous country in South America, with Caracas one of the most dangerous capitals in the world. The Venezuelan Observatory Of Violence (Observatorio Venezolano de la Violencia) has released its study on homicides during 2012 , which put the national homicide rate at 73 per 100,000 of the population, with Caracas registering 122 per 100,000. As a point of comparison, neighboring Colombia, still in the midst of the civil conflict, last year registered just over 31 homicides per 100,000. The study was conducted by the NGO working with six national universities. It put the number of homicides during the year at 21,692, a significant increase on 2011 (19,336), which was went down as the most violent year on record in Venezuelan history. According to the government, the homicide rate for 2011 was just over 48 per 100,000 of the population. Even at this level Venezuela was one of the most dangerous nations in South America. While the statistics can be challenged, the upward trend in homicides cannot. These figures are just part of a wider pattern which began with the election of Hugo Chavez to the presidency in 1999. The blame for this lies on both internal and external factors. The internal factors include rampant corruption in almost all branches of the security forces, a lack of investment in the police force, weak gun control which has led to a proliferation of arms, and a lack of coherent security policy on the part of the Chavez regime. On the external side, there is the fact that Venezuela has become a principal transit nation for Colombian cocaine. This has led not only to the presence of Colombian criminal networks in Venezuela, along with Colombian Marxist rebel groups, but the development of Venezuelan organized crime. Principal among this homegrown organized crime is the "" Cartel of the Suns ,"" a powerful drug trafficking network allegedly led by senior members of the military."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"With Armed Strike in Colombia, ELNs Warmongers Seek Upper Hand. When Colombia's largest guerrilla group declared an ""armed strike"" on the first anniversary of the official start of its peace negotiations with the government, it was just the latest paradox revealing internal cracks in this powerful organization. But it seems the more belligerent factions of the guerrilla group may be taking the upper hand from those seeking peace. The National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional - ELN) announced an armed strike on February 7 that has hit Colombia's rural and urban communities, paralyzing transport, shutting down commerce, spreading fear, and claiming several lives. At least one soldier and several ELN members have been killed since the strike began on February 10. The backlash was swift. On February 12, the Attorney General's Office obtained new arrest warrants against the ELN's top commanders, although for crimes not related to the strike. Five members of the ELN's Central Command, along with several other guerrillas, were charged with last month's killing of three demobilized members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). They were also accused of involvement in recruiting child soldiers in western Colombia. The ELN's Warmongers Among the accused are several chiefs who are currently at the top of some of most violent -- and likely richest -- ELN units. Their actions have posed a threat to the peace process for years, and it is thought that they are seeking at least in part to protect their stake in the drug trade. One is Commander Ogli Angel Padilla, alias ""Fabian,"" who oversees the Western War Front on the Pacific coast where the ELN currently control coca cultivations and cocaine movements. This group has been described as a loose cannon , and it has shown opposition to the peace process for some time. It is also one of the blocs most engaged in open conflict, fighting the powerful Urabenos crime group over prime drug trafficking routes to the Pacific Ocean. In mid-2017, authorities uncovered the first-ever electric narco semi-submersible, a sophisticated vessel built to move tons of cocaine, in the heart of his territory. It was attributed to the ELN. Another wanted ELN commander, Gabriel Yepez Mejia, alias ""HH,"" appears to have been flagged as a major drug trafficker based in the western department of Narino, the cocaine capital of the world and a major heroin hub. This is where the ELN killed the former FARC members, displaying the same unruliness that characterizes the group in much of the country. Also on the list is Gustavo Anibal Giraldo, alias ""Pablito,"" the newest addition to the Central Command, who is wanted in the United States on drug trafficking charges. Notoriously belligerent, he sits astride some of Colombia's most of important drug trafficking routes into Venezuela, and is thought to be hiding out across the border. Pablito's promotion to the leadership council was probably an attempt by the ELN to get him to support peace efforts. So what are their reasons for some of these powerful figures enforcing an armed strike that risks throwing more cold water on the peace process? A Strategic Strike? The ELN claims it is trying to revive the peace talks, attributing the strike to ""the government's refusal to continue the fifth round of conversations in Quito"" as well as the victimization of social leaders and protesters. However, the ELN may also be seeking to strengthen its position in some of Colombia's most criminally strategic regions, as the demobilization of the FARC has left power vacuums across the country. People affected by the Western War Front's strike in the northwestern department of Choco who were consulted by InSight Crime speculated that the ELN may be using the strike as part of their territorial strategy. In addition to feuding over turf with the Urabenos, the group has also accused the army of taking advantage of a recent three-month bilateral ceasefire to extend its territorial control into ELN areas. During the strike, the guerrillas stole several boats from the communities in northern Choco. Locals believe that the ELN may use these to facilitate their own transport in the area. At the same time, the group has warned locals for months that they have disseminated landmines along access roads, one of their favored tactics for maintaining territorial control. It is feasible that the ELN is manipulating the strike to reorganize following the ceasefire, especially in areas where they run lucrative criminal economies. As a result of their actions, the ELN's warmongers are quickly drowning out the group's peace advocates. Clock Ticking for Peace Talks The ELN's armed strike came around a year after the ELN's more powerful cousins, the FARC guerrillas, began to lay down their weapons following a historic peace deal with the government. But Colombia and the ELN's hopes of striking a similar deal are growing fainter by the day. ELN chief peace negotiator ""Pablo Beltran"" is the strongest peace advocate in the Central Command and has been holding court in Ecuador, sitting down with social organizations and calling for the government to return to the negotiating table. But he appears to be in the minority, with the chaos in Colombia strongly contradicting Pablo Beltran's declared intention of ""lowering the intensity of the conflict."" His has been an uphill struggle. The newest round of talks that were supposed to start this year never really took off, with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos recalling his government negotiators after the ELN unleashed a wave of violence following the end of the bilateral ceasefire. Furthermore, Santos is reaching the end of his tenure. Presidential elections are coming up mid-year, putting the talks at further risk. For now, Santos is focusing on military successes. The armed forces claim to have taken 90 ELN members out of action in just over a month, while his negotiators stay home. A successor less amenable to the peace talks could double down on this strategy, potentially giving other elements of the ELN a reason to side with the warmongers over the peacemakers."	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
Honduras Police Purge Turns to Lawyers Who Wiped Records. Authorities in Honduras are investigating legal officials who allegedly accepted bribes to wipe clean the records of officers removed from their posts in a police purge, exposing a new layer of corruption in Honduran institutions. On November 2, investigators raided the offices of the Honduran Security Ministry (Secretaria de Seguridad) and seized files they believe may prove corruption accusations against seven lawyers from the Human Resources and Legal Advice department, reported La Prensa. The raid followed the collection of witness testimonies that described how the officials charged between 5,000 and 50,000 lempiras (approximately $215 to $2,150) to alter or disappear the records of police officers, according to a separate report from La Prensa. The lawyers offered the service to officers who had lost their jobs as part of an ongoing police purge and who wanted a clean slate so they could more easily find other work. Some even reportedly returned to the force after having been separated. Investigators are also looking into allegations the lawyers took bribes to aid police officers in compensation claims against the ministry, as well as suspected contracting irregularities and improper use of government vehicles, La Prensa reported. Honduras has carried out several attempts to purge its police force of corrupt elements in recent years. For the most part, these programs have been criticized as ineffective and bottom heavy, with low ranking officers losing their jobs while the higher ranks escape attention. However, the most recent anti-corruption drive, which is now just over halfway through its 12-month mandate, has shown positive signs of expanding investigations beyond the superficiality that characterized previous programs. Within its first two months, the body evaluated the 272 highest-ranking members of the police, of which 40 percent were dismissed, suspended or offered their voluntary resignation. Nevertheless, the apparent existence of a network of crooked officials giving clean slates to purged police officers is a stark illustration of the many layers of corruption plaguing Honduran security institutions. Other prominent examples include the 2009 murder of the country's drug czar and the 2011 murder of his deputy, both of which were apparently carried out by corrupt police acting on orders from a drug trafficker. Despite convincing evidence implicating top officers in the killings, neither case has yet been brought to court. It is an encouraging sign that Honduran authorities are continuing attempts to dismantle these multi-layered structures. But at the same time, the details revealed by such investigations point to deeply-rooted corruption that will likely prove extremely difficult to completely root out.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Rise in Targeted Kidnappings Cause for Concern in Mexico City. The kidnapping and murder of a university student has sparked broad concern about a rise in targeted kidnappings in Mexico City, and in particular the possible role of criminal group Las Pelonas in these crimes. The lifeless body of Norberto Ronquillo, a marketing student at the Universidad del Pedregal, in Tlalpan, south of Mexico City, was found on June 9, a few kilometers from his university, according to the Attorney General's Office. Ronquillo had been kidnapped on June 4. The kidnappers demanded about $260,000 to free him, which his parents paid. But Ronquillo was never released and it is believed that he was murdered a few hours after his abduction. Initial investigations have pointed to the participation of the criminal gang Las Pelonas in the kidnapping and murder. Las Pelonas has a history of targeting students in Mexico City's neighborhoods of Xochimilco, Tlalpan and Coyoacan, the same area where Ronquillo was kidnapped, according to La Silla Rota. Similar ransom demands were also made. Authorities have had Las Pelonas on their radar since 2007, when they kidnapped Priscila Lora, an 18-year-old girl who was held captive for more than two years and then murdered. Between 2015 and 2018, five more kidnappings were attributed to the group, with three of the victims being killed and two more returned alive. The only member Las Pelonas identified by authorities so far has been its leader, known as ""Las Barbas,"" according to El Universal. Authorities believe the gang owns a number of businesses in Mexico City's neighborhood of Milpa Alta, including restaurants and a club. This allows them to ""recruit"" young people who are tasked with finding potential targets from among private school students. Isabel Miranda de Wallace, president of the organization Alto al Secuestro, said the group is very sophisticated and has decades of experience. ""It is a very well structured criminal organization with 30 years of experience. It was believed to have been dismantled but they have regrouped,"" she told El Universal. In recent years, large criminal groups in Mexico have fragmented into smaller, more volatile groups with specific criminal portfolios. Las Pelonas, despite its lengthy history, appears to have settled into such a niche in recent years, focusing on kidnapping and murdering wealthy students. Targeted kidnappings and larger ransoms have become more frequent in the Mexican capital, as reflected in the sharp increase in these crimes in 2017 and 2018. During the first five months of this year, there were 59 kidnappings in Mexico City, double the amount during over the same period in 2018, according to Alto al Secuestro figures. Ronquillo's abduction and murder, however, has grabbed national attention, highlighting the continued failure by authorities to investigate and stop kidnappings effectively. His killing also shows how small groups like Las Pelonas are willing to employ violence indiscriminately in Mexico City, threatening to destroy the capital's reputation as a safe zone inside the country."	0	0	0	1	1	0	0
"Huge UK Cocaine Seizure on Private Jet Signals Traffickers Growing Boldness. A foiled attempt to smuggle half a metric ton of cocaine in a private jet from Colombia's main international airport to the United Kingdom suggests crime groups are becoming bolder in their efforts to offload the South American country's booming cocaine production. UK authorities announced last week that they had seized 15 cocaine-loaded suitcases and arrested five European passengers on January 29 at the Farnborough Airport near London. The private jet had departed the previous day from Bogota's El Dorado international airport, the largest in Colombia. The United Kingdom's Border Force described the shipment, worth around $70 million in the European country, as ""one of the largest seizures of its kind"" in UK history. The private flight had raised suspicion due to the declared professions of the passengers, according to the Colombian magazine Semana. Among the five passengers who had supposedly paid for the $300,000 flight were two construction workers, an assistant chef, a hairdresser and an unemployed individual. Three of the suspects had entered Colombia with a tourist visa in November 2017 with the intention of buying cocaine for Italy's 'Ndrangheta mafia, according to El Espectador. On the other side of the Atlantic, the seizure sparked an investigation by Colombian authorities into the security failures that allowed the cocaine to take off from Bogota. Colombian law enforcement is looking into the possibility that an individual disguised as a police officer may have helped load the drugs into the plane while it was in a hangar at El Dorado. US and Colombian authorities suspect the shipment was overseen by a Colombian criminal structure that has revived the modus operandi of smuggling via private jets, according to Semana. This group is allegedly also behind the 1.2 metric tons of cocaine seized near the French border with Spain in November 2017, as well as the one metric ton aerial shipment seized a year earlier by French authorities in the southwestern city of Bayonne. As levels of cocaine production in Colombia have risen to new records in recent years, more of the drug has been flowing to Europe. And while most cocaine is shipped across the Atlantic via maritime cargo routes , the use of private planes appears to be a growing in popularity among traffickers. In years past, traffickers preferred to fly drugs into West Africa , where they were shipped on to European markets via land and sea routes. However, recent seizures like the one in the United Kingdom indicate that trafficking groups are now taking greater risks by flying the cocaine straight into Europe, despite significantly stricter security and customs checks. SEE ALSO : European Organized Crime The boom in Colombian cocaine production has increased trafficking groups' capacity to absorb losses from seizures, and has thus emboldened them to carry out smuggling schemes that carry high risks, such as sending larger loads of drugs in individual shipments and flying cocaine-filled suitcases on private jets into major European urban centers. Moreover, the European market has grown in popularity for Colombian traffickers, in part due to the dominance of Mexican groups in supplying cocaine to the United States, the world's largest market for the drug."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"3,000 Mexican Drug Mules Arrested in 41 Countries. According to a document from Mexico's Secretariat of Exterior Relations, last year 2,892 Mexicans sought consular assistance after arrests in 41 countries for drug trafficking, a sign of the global presence of Mexican trafficking organizations. In its report, El Excelsior newspaper says more than 2,000 arrests occurred in the United States, 115 in Spain, 107 in Peru, 96 in Panama, 40 in Japan and 3 as far away as Malaysia. In the US, most of the arrest occurred in border states. Houston, Texas accounted for more than 1,000 arrests, while San Diego saw more than 700. Most of the people arrested were acting as couriers, or ""mules"" in the language of the report, traveling on airplanes and smuggling between 500 grams and five kilograms of narcotics. The concentration of arrests in Houston and San Diego provides valuable insight into the patterns employed by trafficking organizations in the United States. In other words, despite increased vigilance, traffickers continue to employ tried and true routes of distribution. There is no reason to believe this will abate. More broadly, the wide distribution of arrests across the world speaks to the potential breadth of influence of Mexican traffickers. From Asia to Europe, Mexicans appear to be overtaking the Colombians in terms of controlling the wholesale points. Still, it's difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Forty arrests in Japan, for instance, may simply be an effect of good policing rather an increase in the amount of Mexican drug trafficking activities in this country. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Calderon Calls on Mexico to Back Drug War. Mexico's President Felipe Calderon appealed to the population to keep supporting his war against the drug cartels, on the day before a march for peace is due to begin, reports the BBC. The country appears to be growing increasingly tired of the wave of violence that has accompanied Calderon's crackdown against drug-trafficking organizations. As InSight has documented, the policy of going after major kingpins has resulted in more violence as groups are left leaderless and battle amongst themselves for control of smaller pieces of territory. The president told listeners that withdrawal from the struggle against drug organizations was not an option, ""On the contrary, we must redouble our efforts because if we stop fighting they will kidnap, rob and kill all over the country."" A group called No Mas Sangre (No More Blood) will begin a silent march, starting in cities around Mexico, that will arrive in Mexico City on May 8. The rally is intended to call for an end to drug violence. "	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
17 Dead in Honduras Gang Massacre. Honduras is seeing the fallout from Tuesday's grisly massacre inside a shoe factory, when three perpetrators used AK-47s to slaughter 17 people. Honduras is seeing the fallout from Tuesday's grisly massacre inside a shoe factory, when three perpetrators used AK-47s to slaughter 17 people. The minister of security has said the incident is related to a turf war between gang rivals, the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and the Barrio 18 , as the factory allegedly operates on 18 territory (it could also be a vengeance killing, as among the dead is the factory owner's son, the minister said). The factory owner himself was spared as he supposedly left just before the massacre, in order to buy a present for his son, and says that his 25 employees were not linked to the maras. It could be this was a copy-cat killing of the massacres often employed by Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) to terrorize and intimidate the local population. San Pedro Sula, Cortes, where the factory is based, is one of the two municipalities in Honduras where the Zetas reportedly operate, and the region is a key area where gangs refine and traffic cocaine to the US. With an estimated 36,000 members of the maras operating in Honduras, it looks as though the shoe factory slaughter is the latest indication of the country's growing security crisis. 	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Leaders Beset by Graft Scandals to Talk Corruption at Regional Summit. Top government officials from around the region will assemble tomorrow in Peru for the Organization of American States' (OAS) Eighth Summit of the Americas. However, amid the usual shows of grandiose statesmanship, this year will likely also see many uncomfortable conversions between nervous politicians -- and perhaps a heavy dose of hypocrisy -- thanks to the summit's theme: ""democratic governance against corruption."" Corruption scandals in Latin America are developing at a frantic pace, and many of the governments represented at the summit are in precarious positions with multiple investigations eroding their credibility and the credibility of state institutions in general. In just the first three months of 2018, the scandal surrounding Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht has continued to snowball, threatening current and former officials across the continent. Peru's president resigned , while Brazil's former president has been hauled off to prison. Central American governments have been in open conflict with international anti-corruption bodies. Colombia's presidential elections have been tainted by corruption allegations while its faltering peace process has been undermined by accusations of graft. Its neighbor Venezuela has continued its descent into a fully-fledged mafia state, while even the United States has lost claims to the moral high ground thanks to investigations into to the Trump campaign and its associates. The very location of the summit has taken on an ironic slant. Just three weeks ago, Peru's president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, became the first sitting head of state in Latin America to stand down because of the Odebrecht scandal. Virtually every one of his predecessors stretching back to the 1990s has been investigated or convicted of corruption. Kuczynski resigned a day before he was due to face a congressional vote to impeach him over alleged bribes he received from Odebrecht. The day before, opposition politicians had released videos showing the president's supporters apparently bribing opposition lawmakers to vote against the impeachment. ""The future of the region stands at a critical juncture because of the threats to democratic governance Corruption is eating away at institutions from within."" Kuczynski is far from alone in being sucked into the Odebrecht scandal. In March, new evidence emerged that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro may have accepted $35 million in campaign donations in exchange for public contracts. The Odebrecht scandal is also casting a shadow over Colombia's presidential elections, the first round of which will take place in May. The political blocs of two of the three frontrunners, Ivan Duque and German Vargas Lleras -- as well as sitting President Juan Manuel Santos -- have been implicated in the scandal. The other frontrunner, leftist Gustavo Petro, is running on an anti-corruption platform. Petro is also the only one of the frontrunners to fully back the peace process with the now demobilized guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). However, in recent weeks the faltering process has itself been hit by allegations of suspicious contracting and networks of intermediaries siphoning off money destined for post-conflict investments. Meanwhile, in Central America, 2018 has seen the further escalation of clashes between international anti-corruption bodies in Guatemala and Honduras and the countries' elites. In February, the head of the OAS's own Support Mission against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (Mision de Apoyo contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad en Honduras - MACCIH) resigned after the government passed a law that devastated authorities' capacity to investigate and prosecute cases. This was followed in April by news that congressmen who had been indicted on corruption charges had filed a motion to the Supreme Court that seeks to declare the MACCIH unconstitutional. In Guatemala, the latest twist in the struggle between the United Nations' International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (Comision Internacional contra la Impunidad en Guatemala - CICIG) and the government of anti-corruption candidate turned corruption suspect, President Jimmy Morales, saw the government transfer 11 agents working with the CICIG. Perhaps the most famous leader in the region, US President Donald Trump, is also under suspicion of corruption within his inner circle, and perhaps by the president himself. However, Trump recently announced that he will skip the summit, citing the need to attend to a developing situation in Syria. The gathered political leaders at the OAS summit are unlikely to come up with policies that will truly combat the cancer of corruption in the Americas. In fact, many will be more concerned with diverting such efforts in order to preserve their own power. Nevertheless, the assessment of OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro when announcing the summit's theme last year holds true. ""The future of the region stands at a critical juncture because of the threats to democratic governance,"" he said. ""Corruption is eating away at institutions from within."" The constant parade of corruption scandals, which is continuing to gather pace in 2018, is unprecedented. But the results of this conflict remain very much uncertain. The battle lines have been drawn. The fates of Lula, Kuczynski and numerous others in the last few years have exposed chinks in the armor of elite impunity. But those elites are now closing ranks. In some countries, most notably Guatemala and Honduras, elites are openly confronting anti-corruption efforts. In others, such as Brazil, where sitting president Michel Temer has so far avoided prosecution for allegations that eclipse those that condemned Lula, political factions are encouraging anti-corruption efforts against their enemies while protecting their own impunity. In the most extreme case, the government of Venezuela has all but hijacked democracy to protect itself from the incessant allegations while clinging on to power. Numerous tests for anti-corruption campaigns and indeed the strength of democracy in the region are now looming. In Colombia and Brazil, corruption could play a central role in forthcoming elections. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador will soon select new attorneys general , which could prove critical to the future of corruption investigations. Peru currently sits in the eye of a constitutional storm following the resignation of Kuczynski, while Venezuela stands on the brink of a complete democratic collapse. As Almagro stated, the region stands at a crossroads. Where it goes from here will play a determining role in the future of security and democracy in the Americas."	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Sao Paulo Gang Sells Drug Franchises: Police. Brazil's police have found evidence that Sao Paulo criminal group the PCC has developed complex mafia-like systems to control the drug trade, with registered selling points and records of transactions. The First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC) is today the largest criminal organization in Sao Paulo state, and the report gives further evidence of their success in the drug business. Through wiretapping telephone calls, the Sao Paulo Civil Police recorded conversations between drug dealers giving instructions on how to register with the organization, according to a report by newspaper Folha. According to the police, the selling points were each registered in the name of a person or family, who would pay a franchise fee to the PCC. Prices varied between 300 and 500 reals a month ($190 and $320), depending on how profitable the area was. The dealing point could then be subcontracted, with the authorization of the PCC. The investigation found that in exchange, the organization would protect the smaller dealers if they were arrested. Many drugs sold in Brazil, especially marijuana, come via Paraguay, where gangs like the PCC have a strong presence. 	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Puerto Rican Drug Lord Captured in Dominican Republic. Dominican authorities have announced the arrest of Miguel Rivera Diaz, alias ""Bolo,"" one of Puerto Rico's most wanted drug traffickers. According to officials, Rivera had been hiding out in the Dominican Republic for the past decade while he ran a drug trafficking network which smuggled large quantities of cocaine into Puerto Rico. In an official statement, Dominican National Police claimed to have tracked him down to a neighborhood in west Santo Domingo, and arrested him when left his hideout for a haircut. In recent months, they claim he has trafficked at least 2,500 kilos of cocaine into Puerto Rico, and generated around $40 million in profits from his illicit activities. Shortly after his capture, Rivera was handed over to police in Puerto Rico, where he is listed among the territory's most wanted fugitives. His arrest comes just one month after the arrest of another high-profile suspect, Carlos Morales Davila , who was also described as one of Puerto Rico's ""most dangerous"" drug traffickers. The arrests come amid a heightened security crackdown on the island, which authorities have in response to a record surge in homicides. As InSight Crime has pointed out , a major hurdle to citizen security in Puerto Rico is the level of systemic corruption within its police force. According to a September U.S. Department of Justice report , 1,709 officers were arrested between January 2005 and November 2010 on criminal charges ranging from theft to drug trafficking and homicide. The report also found the Puerto Rican police department guilty of committing widespread abuses of civil rights. "	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
"US Treasury Adds Sinaloa Cartels King Midas to Kingpin List. The US Treasury Department has placed two high-level Sinaloa Cartel associates on its ""kingpin"" list, calling the move a ""strategic blow"" to Mexico's most powerful drug trafficking organization even as it appears to be confronting a new threat from a rival cartel. On August 16, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated Mexican nationals Juan Manuel Alvarez Inzunza, alias ""King Midas,"" and Jose Olivas Chaidez, alias ""El Blanco,"" as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers, becoming the latest Sinaloa Cartel operatives added to the so-called ""kingpin"" list. (See Treasury's chart below) Alvarez Inzunza ""provides key money laundering services to high-ranking Sinaloa Cartel members,"" including lieutenants who operate on behalf of cartel leaders Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman and Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias ""El Mayo."" He was arrested in Mexico in March 2016. Olivas Chaidez, meanwhile, runs a transnational drug trafficking cell that smuggles large quantities of cocaine into Southern California, according to Treasury. The designation ""represents a strategic blow to the Sinaloa Cartel?s ability to move illicit drugs and launder drug trafficking proceeds into Mexico, Central America, and South America,? said John E. Smith, Acting Director of OFAC. Treasury also added to its list two Sinaloa-based companies owned and controlled by Alvarez Inzunza. The US assets of both Alvarez Inzunza and Olivas Chaidez have been frozen as a result of the designation, and US citizens are prohibited from conducting transactions with these individuals. The Treasury's designation comes at a time of uncertainty, and perhaps weakness, for the Sinaloa Cartel. Last week, at least one of the sons of El Chapo was reportedly kidnapped before being released over the weekend. While there has been no official confirmation of the release of Alfredo Guzman, the attorney general of Jalisco, the state where the incident took place, said the the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG) was responsible for the kidnapping. As InSight Crime recently noted , the bold attack may be part of a CJNG attempt to make inroads into Sinaloa Cartel territory in the wake of El Chapo's arrest in January. In recent months, the CJNG has reportedly made several violent incursions into northern Mexico, where Sinaloa is believed to be the underworld's main power broker. Such an explanation may be too simplistic, however, considering Sinaloa essentially operates as a drug trafficking federation and even El Chapo's power within the cartel was not absolute. Although El Chapo is now behind bars, a number of the cartel's principal operatives remain free. El Mayo, who has spent some 40 years in the drug business, and Damaso Lopez Nunez, alias "" El Licenciado ,"" are among the remaining cartel bosses that wield the most influence."	1	0	0	0	1	0	0
"GameChangers 2016: After Decade-long Drug War, Mexico Needs New Ideas. Mexico's militarized drug war hit its ten-year birthday during 2016, but with widespread insecurity, spiking homicides and new criminal battlegrounds, no one was celebrating. Although President Enrique Pena Nieto inherited the current crackdown from its architect and his predecessor Felipe Calderon, he has more or less stuck to the same song sheet for his security strategy: deploying more soldiers (and a new militarized police force) onto the streets and going after the bosses of criminal networks. But the (re)capture of Mexico's most wanted drug lord, Joaquin Guzman, alias ""El Chapo,"" in early 2016 was a pyrrhic victory for Pena Nieto -- it was the second time that the Sinaloan boss had been caught after going on the lam from a high-security Mexican prison. And as often happens when bosses are taken out of play, it resulted in more violence and conflict this year. ""El Chapo's looming extradition to the United States seems to have weakened the Sinaloa Cartel and prompted rival groups to go on the offensive,"" we wrote in November. ""An attack targeting the house of El Chapo's mother in June may have resulted from an alliance between the Beltran Leyva Organization and the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation. The latter has also reportedly joined with elements of the Tijuana Cartel in an attempt to usurp the Sinaloa Cartel's operations in Tijuana and in Baja California Sur. All of these factors are likely to contribute to the fragmentation of the cartel, a pattern that has been seen in other Mexican crime groups in recent years."" The small western Mexico state of Colima has seen homicides rise by more than 900 percent compared to last year. A weakened Sinaloa Cartel is also now fighting it out with the relatively new arrival on the criminal scene, the Jalisco Cartel - New Generation (CJNG), which initially began life as a breakaway faction of the Sinaloa group. Some, including the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) now think the CJNG is currently one of Mexico's most powerful criminal organizations. Increasing infighting this year between Mexico's criminal groups, old and new, could explain why homicides -- which initially dropped when Pena Nieto took power at the end of 2012 -- returned halfway through 2016. Homicide rates are now back to where they were during Calderon's administration, and several months of this year have been the country's most violent in the last two decades. Not only did homicides increase, but violence also spread to new parts of the country -- proof that territories continue to be disputed between criminal organizations. States such as Guerrero and Michoacan remain battlegrounds, and new states such as Colima, a tiny state on the Pacific Coast, exploded onto the criminal radar in 2016. ""The small western Mexico state of Colima has seen homicides rise by more than 900 percent compared to last year in a surge of violence that likely is linked to organized crime and has the potential to spill over into neighboring states,"" we noted in May. Mexican government homicide statistics no longer discriminate between violent killings and drug-related murders, but one analysis suggested that killings by criminal networks rose substantially. As we wrote in October, Semaforo Delictivo and Lantia Consultores noted that, ""From January to September 2016, organized crime was responsible for 8,815 homicides, which amounts to 58 percent of all homicides during that period and a 47 percent increase [in OC homicides] in comparison to the same period the previous year."" The fact that organized criminal networks could be committing more murders than they have in recent years reflects a failure of the militarized crackdown, which is supposed to weaken criminal networks and actors and limit their use of violence. Organized crime has proved itself as enterprising and responsive as ever to demand from the United States. The heroin boom north of the border, for example, is being fed and controlled largely by Mexican criminal organizations , a dynamic that has mushroomed since and despite the launch of the drug war in 2006. Authorities have captured 100 out of 122 of the country's most dangerous criminals. ""The DEA has previously warned about the increasing involvement of Mexican crime groups in the lucrative US heroin trade,"" we wrote in September. ""In a June 2016 threat assessment ( pdf ), the agency noted that total heroin seizures in the United States have been steadily increasing for the past five years, and that Mexican heroin has accounted for a growing share of those seizures. According to the document, the agency found that 79 percent of the total weight of heroin that it analyzed in 2014 came from Mexico."" The impact of the heroin boom in the United States made itself felt throughout Mexico in 2016, but perhaps nowhere as hard as in the state of Guerrero, one of the country's most deadly states where violence, lawlessness and impunity reign. Although criminals are killing each other, Mexicans from other walks of life also continued to be victims of violence and disappearances perpetrated not only by delinquents but also by the very state security forces that are supposed to be combating insecurity. High Targets, Low Results The government crackdown against organized crime began in December 2006 , when Calderon sent some 6,000 troops to his home state of Michoacan to control violence generated by warring drug gangs. A few months earlier gunmen had dumped five severed heads on a disco dance floor. By the end of Calderon's administration there were 75 military bases around the country dedicated to public security, and that number has more than doubled under Pena Nieto's watch; there are now 162 military bases around the country, according to reports by Mexican online outlet Animal Politico. There have been results. The Mexican government, for instance, has proven itself adept at netting drug bosses. Authorities have captured 100 out of 122 of the country's most dangerous criminals. But as cartel leaders have been eliminated or removed from the criminal landscape, new turf battles have opened up between rival groups, through succession conflicts, or due to the inevitable fragmentation of cartels into more ruthless splinter groups. Meanwhile, the Mexican military, still the country's most trusted security institution, has been involved in serious human rights abuses, disappearances and extrajudicial killings. An investigation by the New York Times suggested that during the drug war, the Mexican army has displayed an exceptionally high kill rate, and estimates for the drug war dead vary enormously, from 130,000 to as high as 200,000. ""The militarization of public security has pushed Mexico into a seemingly endless spiral of violence,"" The Times wrote. ""The military is about confrontation and controlling physical space, something that intensifies conflict rather than defusing it over the long haul. Add to this a record of serious human rights abuses, and you have a recipe for backlash, especially in the poorer, more marginalized areas where the military is dispatched."" Dissent on the wisdom of militarization in Mexico came from who should arguably its biggest defender -- the head of the armed forces, General Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda. He said that dispatching soldiers to combat criminal networks was a ""mistake,"" and that ""soldiers prepared for war"" confronting criminals with no military training has caused ""serious problems."" The general also admitted that tactics such as day time raids have left the civilian population at risk. As insecurity and homicides grew this year, so did the pushback from civil society, faced with an incompetent and indifferent justice system which neither Pena Nieto nor his predecessor have reformed for the better (90 percent of murders still go unsolved). In states like Guerrero and Michoacan, civilian armed groups continued to take up arms to defend their areas in the absence of state protection, often resulting in more conflict. Year after year, Mexico's government has failed to match its investment in military might with new thinking, social programs and other measures designed to weaken drug trafficking and criminality. ""Two self-defense groups in Mexico's troubled state of Guerrero have accused each other of involvement in organized crime, illustrating the complexity of the criminal landscape in the country's heroin epicenter,"" we noted in November. ""The conflict between the two armed groups -- former allies supposedly dedicated to the protection of Guerrero's beleaguered communities -- shows how all social actors are impacted by the lawlessness, criminality and impunity that characterizes one of Mexico's most violent states."" Civilian search parties looking for ""disappeared"" family members emerged in Guerrero in the wake of the mass abduction of 43 students in 2014. These search groups have spread around Mexico to other states this year, showing that the country's crisis of missing people , which has emerged since the drug war and been linked to the police and military as well as criminal groups, is now nation-wide. ""Family members of disappeared persons in east Mexico have discovered 75 mass graves in a month in a stark demonstration of the incapacity -- or unwillingness -- of authorities to determine the fate of thousands of citizens that have gone are missing in the country,"" we reported. ""The Solecito Collective of Veracruz (Colectivo Solecito de Veracruz) found the mass graves in Colinas de Santa Fe, an urban area of Veracruz city that borders the port facility there, the organization's coordinator Lucia de los Angeles told Radio Formula. Despite the huge weaknesses of Mexico's militarized strategy, a new Interior Security Law proposed by Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) towards the end of the year actually wants to expand the role of the armed forces in the drug war. Future Prospects Mexico needs some new ideas. Unless the country improves, in real terms, its corrupt and ineffective justice system, the criminal impunity feeding so much of the insecurity around the country will continue. Pena Nieto's government must find the political will and resources to go after the financial assets of Mexico's criminal groups. The authorities must also take on the socioeconomic factors that make a life of crime an attractive prospect to Mexico's youth. There are good reasons why the Mexican government chose to turn to its military in 2006 to combat organized crime. It is the country's most trusted and able security force, and at the time Calderon's government was facing down the Zetas and the Beltran Leyva Organization, which were comprised of highly-trained, well-equipped former soldiers with formidable firepower. One could argue that in present day Mexico the CJNG in Jalisco pose a different but equally mammoth challenge to the Mexican state -- the group leapt to fame when it brought down a military helicopter with an rocket propelled grenade launcher last year. But year after year, Mexico's government has failed to match its investment in military might with new thinking, social programs and other measures designed to weaken drug trafficking and criminality, and 2017 promises to be the same. With elections due in 2018, it will fall to the Mexican people to decide if they wish for more of the same from the PRI or whether they may have finally reached that elusive tipping point, and will start trying some fresh ideas."	1	0	1	1	0	0	0
"Have Mexico Cartels Seized Control of Spain Drug Trafficking?Three Mexican cartels are reportedly competing for control of the cocaine trade in Spain, although there are few signs they have successfully displaced the longstanding networks from Colombia as the main operators in this key strategic territory for drug trafficking in Europe. Spanish police say the Sinaloa Cartel, the Zetas and the ""cartel from Michoacan"" -- presumably the Michoacan based Knights Templar -- have all established a presence in the country, according to an investigation by Mexican newspaper El Universal. Their aim is to take control of the European cocaine trade by forcing Colombian drug traffickers out of the country, then using Spain as a base for importing and distributing product. For some years, the Mexicans have been sending emissaries to Spain to build contacts with local distributors, money launderers and lawyers, according to El Universal. There are also indications they have looked to establish a more permanent presence, with the Sinaloa Cartel sending leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman's cousin, Jesus Gutierrez Guzman, to Spain to oversee the cartel's operations. However, Gutierrez was arrested in 2012. Police sources told El Universal the Mexicans favor sending small quantities of drugs to minimize losses in the case of interdiction. Cocaine is either moved in shipping containers through the ports of Barcelona, Algecira and Lisbon, in Portugal, or is carried by drug mules flying into the country. Passage of the mules is facilitated by corrupt contacts at Madrid airport, with baggage handlers, maintenance personnel, and even cleaning staff paid between 5,000 and 10,000 Euros to aid the movement of 8-10 kilo loads of cocaine, according to El Universal. The mules flying in to Spain, however, often do not depart from Mexico, where airport security has improved dramatically in recent years, according to Spanish customs. Instead, they leave from countries with high levels of corruption in the airports, notably Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and the Dominican Republic. Many of the mules are of Latin American origin who also have Spanish passports, allowing them to move freely into the country with no need for a visa. There have been warning signs -- some real, some ficticious -- for some years that Mexican cartels are trying to expand their share of the European market through Spain. As far back as 2009, then Spanish Customs' Director Nicolas Bonilla told US officials that ""Mexicans were replacing Colombians as cocaine traffickers to Spain,"" acccording to a leaked US diplomatic cable. European police force Europol has warned several times about the growing influence of Mexican organized crime, and even raised fears the groups could bring the violence associated with them to the continent. Arguably as important as official discourse is legend. Mexican traffickers like Sandra Avila Beltran, a.k.a. ""La Reina del Pacifico,"" or ""Queen of the Pacific,"" a Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) operator reportedly established connections with the Spanish underworld in the early 2000s to move cocaine through the peninsula. Avila's life was immortalized in both novel and telenovela formats. It is not surprising the Mexicans want to claim a share of the European market. While cocaine consumption in the United States has been falling, in Europe it is on the rise, and the drug's retail price is often significantly higher. Trafficking drugs to Europe also apprears to run a lower risk of interdiction than in the United States -- where substantially more cocaine has been seized in recent years than in Europe even though they are now markets of comparable size -- and for traffickers that are caught, there is much lower risk of being extradited. Spain is the ideal base for the Mexicans to gain access to this market. Not only is it a substantial market in its own right -- Spain has one of the highest cocaine user rates in the world -- it is also one of the main entry points for Latin American drugs destined for the continental market, and it offers an easier environment to do business due to the shared language. European Organized Crime However, Spain has long been the territory of Colombian organized crime, and there are numerous indications that these groups are still more deeply embedded in the Spanish underworld than their Mexican counterparts. In its last report, released in 2013, Europol stated that Colombian groups continued to dominate the cocaine trade, while the extent of the Mexican presence remained unclear.In addition, the arrests of Latin American organized crime operatives in Spain, indicate the Colombian operations in the country are still substantially more sophisticated than those of their Mexican counterparts. While the Mexicans arrested vary from drug mules to high level brokers, they tend to be individuals or small groups overseeing trafficking operations. In contrast, arrests of Colombians show how they maintain deeply embedded cells with a military capacity, including ""collection offices"" (oficinas de cobro) -- armed wings of trafficking organizations that collect drug debts by kidnapping and assassinating. However, the current state of flux and fragmentation of the Colombian underworld is having a knock on effect in Europe, according to Europol, and may create the conditions for the Mexicans to live up to years of hype and finally seize control of European cocaine trafficking. Most of the Colombian operatives in Spain are connected to the now defunct Norte Del Valle Cartel (NDVC) and its descendent , the Rastrojos. Since the loss of their leadership in mid-2012, the Rastrojos have splintered into regional factions, leaving networks operating out of a foreign country especially isolated and vulnerable. The Mexicans though, may face competition if they are to attempt to usurp these operations. The Rastrojos' principal Colombian competitors, the Urabenos, have been capitalizing on the implosion of their rivals within Colombia, and there is evidence they are also looking to co-opt their international operations, including in Spain, where a high profile Urabenos leader was recently arrested. Nevertheless, the prospect of a violent standoff between the Mexicans and the Urabenos in Spain or anywhere else in Europe seems remote. Far more likely is that drug trafficking through the Iberian Peninsula will be carried out through new networks involving multiple partners. According to Europol, the fragmentation of Colombian organized crime has not only been capitalized on by Mexican groups, but also European organizations keen to increase their role in drug trafficking by building new contacts both in Europe and in Latin America. There have also been indications the remnants of the Rastrojos and NDVC structures have been seeking out new international backers, not only in Colombia but also in Mexico. Unless Mexican groups are willing to stage a full scale foreign invasion to wrest control of the country away from the Colombians -- which would be a highly costly and risky endeavor -- then the future of drug trafficking in Spain is more likely to involve decentralized and fluid transnational networks, within which Mexicans, Colombians and Europeans all have a role to play."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
US Gangs Increase Links to Mexican Cartels+L322. A series of reports highlights growing ties between US gangs and Mexican drug cartels, and the corruption north of the border that helps facilitate drug trafficking -- dynamics that echo what is seen in Mexico. In El Universal, Jose Luis Pardo and Alejandra S. Inzunza, members of the journalist collective Dromomanos , documented Mexican criminal organizations' relationship with both gangs and law enforcement in the United States. They reported how US gangs associated with Mexican cartels -- primarily the Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas -- flourish in Texas border counties. In the outskirts of one county, Zapata, the local sheriff told the reporters that nearly everyone in the neighborhood was involved in criminal activity and that the zone was a hotspot for drug stash houses. Groups like Tango Blast and Texas Syndicate, as well as transnational gangs like the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) and Texas-born prison gang Barrio Azteca, serve as muscle, couriers and local drug vendors for the Mexican groups, Texas officials told the reporters. Mexican cartels also rely heavily on corruption in the US border region, paying off sheriffs, border agents and customs officials. Sometimes these ties go much deeper than a bribe. One notable example was that of the Panama Unit, an anti-drug police unit in Hidalgo, Texas, which became involved in guarding and stealing drug loads. Cases of drug-related official corruption have emerged in most Texas border counties, according to Pardo and Inzunza. Official reports published this year by California and Texas discussed the increasingly close relationship between gangs in these states and Mexican cartels. In the most recent US National Gang Report , 23 percent of police surveyed said gangs with ties to Mexican organized crime were present in their jurisdiction. Mexican groups have long maintained a relationship with US gangs, but in the past this was largely limited to drug sales. Now, the gangs carry out more sophisticated criminal activities on behalf of cartels, allowing the larger groups to reduce their operational risks in US territory. In return, the gangs receive discounts on the drugs they buy. This is a dynamic also seen within Mexico, where some 43 gangs -- including groups like Los Rojos and Guerreros Unidos, as well as lesser-known gangs -- are now affiliated with the major cartels. This outsourcing of labor is largely a product of a fragmenting criminal landscape, in which the major syndicates no longer enjoy the hegemony they once had. Payoffs to officials is a common phenomenon on the Mexican as well as the US side of the border, with Mexican government officials at various levels, as well as in law enforcement , known to associate with drug groups.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Will North American Leaders Stay the Wrong Course on Heroin?Mexico's heroin production was a central point in the recent summit of North American leaders, but the remedies under discussion show a remarkable unwillingness to learn from past mistakes. At last week's Ottawa summit of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and American President Barack Obama, one of the items up for consideration was the heroin epidemic. Ahead of the event they promised to unveil a new joint plan to deal with the heroin threat in both countries, though the precise details of this plan were ultimately not made public. While coverage of the summit primarily highlighted Obama's impromptu rant against Donald Trump in the joint press conference, he also highlighted in his remarks the scourge of ""opioid abuse,"" ""narcotraffickers,"" and the ""heroin that is taking so many lives and devastating so many families."" Days before the conference, NSA official Mark Feierstein told reporters , ""President Obama will ask President Pena Nieto to continue his efforts to reduce the production of poppy."" Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Mexican diplomat Paulo Carreno had indicated the nations had negotiated ""a plan to combat increased opium poppy cultivation and heroin use,"" adding that the plan went beyond eradication. The reasons for the concern are justified. The American appetite for heroin, which had plummeted following a prior epidemic in the 1960s and '70s, has again skyrocketed. Nearly 11,000 Americans died of heroin overdoses in 2014, compared to just over 3,000 in 2010 and 1,842 in 2000. Mexican cultivation of poppy (the plant used for the production of heroin) has also leapt northward during the same period. The US government estimated a nearly 60 percent increase in the hectares used for poppy production from 2013 to 2014, from 11,000 to 17,000. The Mexican government recently published its own estimate of nearly 25,000 hectares on average in use in 2015. Out of a total of 32 Mexican states, nine produce heroin. Clearly, there is reason for the US and its neighbors to step up their efforts to rein in the heroin trade. But recent history shows that their focus on limiting production is woefully inadequate. It seems that the governments are not learning from even their most notorious mistakes. Since Richard Nixon initiated the War on Drugs more than 40 years ago, the US has focused much of its effort on limiting the supply of drugs produced in foreign countries. Two of the most prominent tactics of the supply side-first approach, employed both by the US and their foreign government allies, are eradication of drug production facilities and targeting the foreign kingpins who oversee these operations. The latter tactic has had mixed results, but eradication -- whether in Mexico in the 1970s, Colombia in the 1990s and 2000s, or Afghanistan following the US invasion -- has been an unmitigated failure. In virtually every case where eradicating the crops has been a major element of the anti-drug strategy, it has militarized the effort, as the armed forces are among the only bodies with the manpower and sophistication to carry it out over a wide area. This is bad for the military, distracting them from national defense, and bad for the basic democratic concept of civilian control over public security. Eradication has been unnecessarily punitive toward the largely poor farmers who are caught between the incentives of the market, the demands of local kingpins and the dictates from central governments. Eradication efforts inevitably carry with them dangerous environmental and political side effects. Even beyond all that, eradication doesn't work on its own terms. There's little evidence that even the most determined campaign does anything to reduce production on a global scale. At best, it merely pushes the means of supply elsewhere, at which point the market adapts, with little if any long-term effect on availability or prices in the US. This is precisely why for decades analysts have been calling for more focus on demand. In 2016, such arguments are so commonplace as to be virtual cliches. However, the US and Mexico, at least in their rhetoric, are somehow repeating these past errors. This decision is even more inexplicable because the US has a substantial arsenal of weapons for cracking down on heroin; more so than for any other drug. The heroin epidemic is largely a function of US pharmaceutical firms' push for wider use of opioid painkillers like Hydrocodone and OxyContin in the 1990s. Doctors began prescribing these powerful drugs, which kill pain but generated dependency as reliably as heroin does, for everything from back pain to carpal tunnel syndrome. Addicts inevitably discovered that they could get their opioid fix more reliably and cheaply from black-market heroin, which drove the Mexican increase in cultivation. In other words, the opioid prescription explosion is a feeder for the heroin epidemic. And the US has any number of tools to limit the use of opioids, which would ultimately undercut heroin demand. For instance, it could use Medicaid rules to limit access to benefits for fraudulent opioid prescriptions, which is a common way for addicts and small-time dealers to game the system. It could, as Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) suggested in a recent hearing with DEA chief Chuck Rosenburg, ask the DEA to crack down on pharmaceutical companies' production of opioid medicines. Currently such production far outstrips national estimates of the legitimate medical need for opioid drugs, with the illegal market picking up the slack. In the tricky realm of drug control policy, these count as easy, obvious fixes. Yet based on current reports, Obama and Pena Nieto would rather repeat the failed policies of the past.

"Peru Forgers Cashing in on Venezuelas Dollar Demand. Police in Peru have reported that seizures of counterfeit dollars in 2014 were twice as high as the previous year, a pattern likely driven by the demand for fake dollars in economically unstable countries such as Venezuela and Argentina. According to El Comercio , the fraud division of Peru's investigative police (DIRINCRI) seized nearly $18 million counterfeit dollars in 2014, compared to nine million the year before. They credit increased cooperation with the US Secret Service -- which established a Lima office in 2012 -- as well as skyrocketing demand for US currency in some parts of Latin America. ""The increase in seizures could be due to a higher number of criminal acts and not the efficiency of the police,"" one expert told El Comercio. However, police dismantled a record five counterfeiting groups in 2014, according to a December 2 press conference given by Interior Minister Daniel Urresti. The latest bust occurred in November 2014, when police seized $3.7 million in fake cash. Criminal groups send fake money to Venezuela, Argentina, and the United States by using currency ""mules,"" who carry a mixture of counterfeit bills and real money on their person or in their luggage. A policeman from the DIRINCRI told InSight Crime that Peruvian forgers had a huge market in Venezuela, where hunger for dollars and the presence of an immense black market was providing counterfeiters with a bonanza. Peru has now reportedly become the largest producer of counterfeit dollars in the world. One US investigator told Global Post that 17 percent of fake dollars in the United States come from Peru. It isn't limited to dollars either: Peruvian counterfeiters also forge euros and the local currency, nuevo soles. Peruvian forgers are highly skilled and tend to use offset printers and other intricate techniques, unlike US based counterfeiters who mostly use photocopiers. Yet it is Latin America that is providing the boon for Peruvian counterfeiters, where an appetite for US dollars in countries like Venezuela and Argentina is driven by prolonged financial crises and strict foreign exchange controls. Not only do black markets offer staggering exchange rates for dollars -- in Venezuela, one US dollar could fetch up to 173.8 bolivars in mid-January 2015, compared to an official rate of just 6.3 -- but the clandestine nature of those markets makes it easier for forgeries to be passed into circulation."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"US Deportations to El Salvador Sending Migrants to Their Deaths: Report. A Human Rights Watch investigation has found that more than 100 people were killed after deportation from the United States to El Salvador, affirming media and immigration watchdog claims that Central American deportees have met violent deaths. Using press reports, court documents, as well as interviews with victims' families and authorities, researchers with Human Rights Watch (HRW) documented 138 people killed between 2013 and 2019 after being deported. Of these, 81 were killed within a year of their return to El Salvador, 15 others killed within two years, and the rest within five years, according to a 117-page report titled ""Deported to Danger"" published in February 2020. In the report, HRW documented patterns in the cases, including that several had been threatened by El Salvador's violent street gangs prior to their removal from the United States. A man identified only as Jose Miguel C. told HRW investigators that his nephew Joaquin fled to the United States after being threatened by MS13 gang members. Joaquin was killed in 2017, the same year he was deported, his uncle told investigators, adding that ""Joaquin always said the [MS13 members] would try to kill him again."" Also in 2017, a 25-year-old man was killed the same day he was deported from El Salvador. Gang members had tried to kill him two years earlier, police told HRW. Long-term US residents who were deported faced particular dangers because they were more likely to refuse to pay extortion demands, or to report gang threats to authorities, according to the report. Gang members were extorting 43-year-old Carlos Alberto Garay when he was shot dead by gunmen who stopped his pickup in 2015, according to the report and an article by La Prensa Grafica. Another man, identified as Jacinto K., returned to El Salvador with his wife and 15-year-old son after he received a removal order from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Shortly after Jacinto's return, MS13 gang members began to extort a small business he opened, he told HRW investigators in 2014. Though he worried he wouldn't be able to keep paying the ""renta,"" he said he felt relatively safe. Two weeks after investigators interviewed him, he was gunned down in broad daylight. Former police officials were targeted after being deported. For example, a local female police officer was killed after she sought asylum in the United States, according to her cousin who spoke with HRW investigators. Her cousin said US officials had rejected her credible fear interview, the first step to asylum. In 2017, she was found dead, with gunshot wounds to her stomach and skull. Six deportees were also allegedly killed by local police or death squads, according to the report. The human rights group criticized US authorities for turning a ""blind eye to the reality that people deported by the United States to El Salvador had lost their lives."" Many deportees had sought safety in the United States only to be ""returned directly back to the violence they originally feared,"" the report states. The HRW report makes starkly clear the immediate consequences of the United States rejecting asylum claims and deporting migrants without fully considering the dangers they face back home - the same dangers they were seeking to escape from. The trouble, as the report points out, is that it's nearly impossible to understand the full scope of the problem. ""We know it's an undercount,"" Alison Parker, the US managing director for Human Rights Watch, told InSight Crime. Authorities in El Salvador also often fail to denote whether a murder victim was deported. Police and prosecutors have limited resources , making it nearly impossible to properly investigate each case in a small country that ranks as one of the deadliest in Latin America. Also, victims' family members are often reluctant to tell authorities that their loved one was deported, because of a stigma that only criminals are returned, Parker said. Meanwhile, no US agency tracks murdered deportees, Parker said. In the HRW report, there are few details about the reasons for deportation in each case, though some people were removed for committing crimes in the United States or for alleged gang ties. The report also does not detail whether all the deportees had applied for asylum. ""Nobody is watching this situation,"" Parker said. Since 2014, tens of thousands of migrants from the Northern Triangle Countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have arrived at the United States' southwestern border each year, according to US Customs and Border Protection figures. Many are families and unaccompanied children fleeing poverty and violence , or looking to be reunited with loved ones. Many have also sought US asylum, based on threats from street gang members, police officers, or their husbands or partners. US immigration law, however, limits who is eligible for asylum. To be eligible, asylum seekers must belong to a particular social group and be persecuted because of their identity, race, religion or political beliefs. For this reason, it has always been a legal challenge for people fleeing gangs or domestic violence to receive asylum. In the past, however, immigration judges were given latitude to take into account the particulars of a case, including if the asylum seekers were teenage boys who had resisted gang recruitment and witnessed crimes, or if they were teenage girls who had been threatened with rape by gang members. And immigration law had opened up slightly to claims that domestic violence victims had a basis to claim asylum. That has all come to an end with the administration of President Donald Trump, which has tightened asylum rules to make it harder to gain entry to the United States by citing fear of gangs or domestic violence , according to the HRW report. The administration has also forced asylum seekers to wait out their court proceedings in dangerous Mexico border towns and signed a ""safe third country"" agreement with Guatemala , meaning that migrants traveling through the Central American country would first have to pursue asylum there. The US has sought similar asylum deals with El Salvador and Honduras. On their journey to the United States, Central American migrants are frequent targets of criminal gangs. While waiting out their asylum claims in Mexico, they have continued to be threatened with violence, and subject to kidnapping and extortion. Whether El Salvador's deportees faced greater dangers when they were returned is hard to assess, Parker said, but it is possible. ""They may well be at a heightened risk, because they have already been targeted,"" she said. ""If you fled and go back, you will come to the attention of the gang very quickly, and any attempt to relocate will create a whole new set of risks."""	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Brazils PCC Expands Criminal Activity, Trafficking Arms From Venezuela. Brazil's biggest criminal group has reportedly attempted to smuggle high-powered firearms from Venezuela in order to expand its illegal activities, taking advantage of the neighboring country's economic crisis, lack of oversight on the part of the government and the new dynamics on the border generated by a wave of Venezuelan migrants. A recently leaked telephone wiretap picked up a conversation between two members of the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC) about the purchase of AK-47 and AR-15 rifles from Venezuela. The gang members are currently imprisoned in facilities in the PCC's home city of Sao Paulo and in the northern state of Roraima along the border with Venezuela. Roraima state police intercepted the September 4, 2017 conversation as part of an investigation that showed ""for the first time that the border has become a trade route for heavy arms related to drug trafficking,"" reported Brazil's O Globo , which gained exclusive access to the wiretap transcript. In one part of the conversation, the PCC members discuss high-caliber weapons and their prices. ""Jacana,"" incarcerated in the Sao Paulo state penitentiary system, is speaking to a man identified as ""Toni Caolho,"" a prisoner at the Monte Cristo Agricultural Penitentiary in Boa Vista, Roraima, about caliber sizes. ""Ahem. And what about the thicker ones?"" ""The thickest ones -- I'm getting there, bro. I'm getting there with the AK-47s! The guy said he's sending me some pictures this week. An AR-15, you know? We're looking into prices here, bro."" O Globo's report also references the arrest of two Venezuelans a few months ago, when they were caught trafficking drugs to Roraima. Saved on one of their cell phones were messages from inmates in Brazil asking them to deliver high-caliber weaponry. These findings reveal the possibility that the most powerful gang in Brazil is smuggling drugs and weapons from Venezuela in search of new routes and partners to continue expanding its criminal activities in South America. On the other hand, this connection or exchange between criminal groups from the two countries is not surprising to Brazilian authorities. In August 2017, Roraima Governor Suely Campos had warned about the increase of crime in the state due to an influx of Venezuelan migrants, and requested that President Michel Temer strengthen security along the border. ""We have 2,000 kilometers of land border with many hidden access routes that have been transformed into trafficking routes for drugs, people and heavy weapons by criminal organizations,"" Campos said in a press release. Increased activity at border crossing points caused by migration of Venezuelans seeking refuge in Brazil could be the primary stimulus for a number of criminal economies in border regions between the two nations. The governor specifically referred to the road between Venezuela's state of Amazonas and Brazil's Roraima as being ""used as a bona fide corridor for drugs and weapons to enter through the border."" While there is no certainty regarding the origin of the arms the PCC members were discussing in the recorded call, it would not be surprising if members of the Venezuelan military who are frequently involved in acts of corruption and drug trafficking are now driven by the economic crisis in their country to turn to arms trafficking with the Brazilian gang. AK-47s are official weapons of Venezuela's Bolivarian National Armed Forces (Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana -- FANB). The institution has been accused in the past of selling or giving weapons to Colombian rebel groups and the gang leaders, or ""pranes,"" who control the prisons and mining region of Venezuela. AR-15s, meanwhile, are supposedly not imported by the Venezuelan government. But some elite police units received an endowment of such guns in 2017. A week ago, on February 16, a judicial police officer was caught attempting to sell an AR-15 to a criminal organization. The value of both rifles on the Venezuelan black market is between $5,000 and $8,000. But in the Brazilian market, criminal groups pay up to $22,000 for these powerful firearms. Thus, Venezuela's economic crisis and its government's lack of control over the use and delivery of its official weapons are facilitating the activities of crime groups seeking to expand their illicit businesses in the region."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Attack Shows Fractures in Mexicos Guerrero Vigilantes. A dissident faction of a vigilante group in Mexico's Guerrero state has allegedly attacked other community police, in a sign this group, like their Michoacan neighbors, is experiencing major cracks in its leadership. According to La Cronica de Hoy , a group of civilians headed by former leaders of the community police network known as the Regional Coordinator of Community Authorities (CRAC) assaulted and fired on other vigilantes and their detainees at a courthouse in the municipality of San Luis Acatlan on March 18. The attack, in which one person was seriously injured, required the intervention of the Mexican army. Milenio reports that the assault on the courthouse involved 80 people who were attempting to rescue two men who were taken captive by vigilantes led by CRAC coordinator Eliseo Villar Castillo. The men were detained for their alleged involvement in an attack on Villar Castillo while he was driving toward a nearby municipality on March 16. Meanwhile, Excelsior reported that up to 300 unarmed people approached the courthouse and were received with gunfire from 30 community police led by Villar Castillo's faction. The situation follows the emergence of an apparent division within the group, with dissident leaders forming a small regional assembly that accuses Villar Castillo and several others of defrauding the group of some $55,000. This case is further cause for concern as vigilante groups in the neighboring state of Michoacan also appear to be fragmenting. In both cases, these divisions have occurred amid accusations of irregular activity by the groups' leaders. In Michoacan, where the militia groups gained semi-legal recognition in January, these divisions have been quite serious. The attack in Guerrero comes on the heels of the arrest and incarceration of Michoacan vigilante leader Hipolito Mora on murder charges, while rival vigilante leaders in the state have hurled accusations amongst themselves of involvement with the Knights Templar criminal organization. Mora now claims he was betrayed in this ongoing dispute. The recent attack is one indication the vigilante movement in Guerrero is seeing a similar process of violent fragmentation. The CRAC, which formed nearly two decades ago, has also faced recent pressure from the Mexican government over fears it may be spiraling out of control. Recent events in Michoacan have made it clear that applying a legal framework to the self-defense initiative does not necessarily solve any problems. The question now is how the government will move forward in both states to prevent these movements from breaking out into criminal activity and taking the law into their own hands.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Drug Gangs Traffic Girls on Honduras-Nicaragua Border: UN. A UN official has warned that drug gangs are trafficking young girls from indigenous communities on the border between Honduras and Nicaragua -- a phenomenon that could be driven by the countries' sex tourism industries. Mirna Cunningham, president of the UN's Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, said girls between the ages of 10 and 15 in the Coco River area of the border region are sold to drug traffickers for as much as $2,000 each, reports El Nuevo Diario. Cunningham, who based her statements on information from womens' organizations in the region, said that fear of reprisals by drug traffickers discouraged residents from reporting the practice to the authorities. Melvin Duarte, spokesperson for Honduras' Public Ministry, said the special prosecutor for children's issues has ordered an investigation into the trafficking of young girls in the indigenous region of border, an area known on the Nicaraguan side as the Autonomous Region of the Northern Atlantic (RAAN). In Nicaragua, Public Ministry official Odett Leyton said the armies of Honduras and Nicaragua were coordinating a joint investigation into the issue, AFP news service reported. El Nuevo Diario notes that Carmen Poveda, head of the Commission for Women in the RAAN, said that the region is an important drug trafficking route, and that the intelligence service of Nicaragua's National Police is already investigating human trafficking in the region. The reports offer further evidence of the links between drug trafficking and sex trafficking in the region. The indigenous people of the Coco River area in Honduras and Nicaragua are particularly vulnerable to this practice, due to high levels of poverty and a low state presence. The victims are sometimes sold to traffickers by their own families, according to the UN's Cunningham. According to the State Department's 2011 Trafficking in Persons Report , victims of sex trafficking in Nicaragua and Honduras are often taken from rural areas to work as prostitutes in urban areas, in many cases lured with false promises of better employment. Both countries are international sex tourism destinations, contributing to the demand for sex workers, which organized criminal groups have stepped in to fill. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Rise in Colombia Human Rights Murders Linked to Neo-Paramilitaries. A human rights watchdog in Colombia documented a rise in killings of human rights defenders in 2013 with paramilitaries the primary perpetrators, a development likely linked to continued push-back against land reform by economic interests with criminal ties. The annual report of the Colombian NGO Somos Defensores noted an increase in the number of human rights workers murdered, from 69 in 2012 to 78 in 2013. Of the 78 defenders killed, 15 were reportedly by paramilitary groups, eight by guerrillas, 5 by members of government security forces, and 50 by unknown authors. These numbers represent an increase in assassinations by paramilitary groups (from nine in 2012 to 15 in 2013) and security forces (from one to five), and a decrease in those by guerrillas (from 11 to eight). Somos Defensores speculates this decrease may be tied to advances in peace talks between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in Cuba. Overall, Somos Defensores counted 366 aggressions against human rights defenders and social organizations, including threats, assaults, forced disappearances, and arbitrary detentions. The NGO attributed 50 percent of these incidents to paramilitaries. The most targeted human rights leaders were farmers, indigenous people, and those fighting for land restitution, while murders of rural leaders increased from three in 2012 to 15 in 2013. The targeting of human rights defenders in Colombia is generally a result of these defenders crossing the paths of powerful economic elites with criminal ties looking to protect their interests, and the problem has been particularly acute in regards to the intimidation of land activists, often by paramilitary-style groups. The issue has its roots in Colombia's armed conflict, when many rural and indigenous communities were displaced from resource rich land by paramilitaries, often working on behalf of private agri-businesses and cattle ranchers. Since the formal demobilization of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), some of these businesses have continued to use neo-paramilitary criminal groups such as the Urabenos to suppress calls for land reform through targeted assassinations of activists. Drug trafficking also complicates land restitution, with groups such as the Urabenos and the Rastrojos controlling drug corridors in areas central to the land conflict. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), the paramilitary drug trafficking hybrid organizations labeled the ""BACRIM"" groups (for the abbreviation of the Spanish for ""criminal bands"") now represent the most serious impediment to Colombia's land restitution process. They have also been pointed to as responsible for 30 percent of human rights violations in the country."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Drug Mules Could Be Victims Under New Ecuador Criminal Code. Recent reforms to Ecuador's Criminal Code could allow for arrested drug ""mules"" to be considered victims rather than criminals, a pioneering step towards recognition that people are often forced into smuggling drugs, but one that could create a tricky legal gray area. Ecuador's new Criminal Code -- which was approved in January 2014 and is expected to come into force sometime in 2015 -- will penalize drug trafficking according to the quantities carried, reported El Comercio. The amount of drugs that constitute the ""minor,"" ""medium,"" ""large"" and ""extra-large"" amounts stipulated by the new law still needs to be defined by the Narcotics Control Council (Consep). Ecuador's repealed Law 108 on Narcotic and Psychoactive Substances made no distinction between large-scale traffickers and small-scale transporters, while 40 percent of the law's articles were focused on criminal punishment rather than prevention and rehabilitation. According to El Comercio, the aim of the new Code is also to open up the possibility of the subject being included in the victims and witness protection program, on the condition that information is provided leading to the arrest of those responsible. ""For the first time, this law defines the 'mule' as being a potential victim,"" said National Public Defender Ernesto Pazmino. Although smuggling drugs internationally can yield extremely high profits, many people throughout Latin America are forced into the task by criminal groups who are threatening them or their loved ones, or to resolve a debt. The issue has at times been recognized by other countries in the region, as was the case with a Mexican architect coerced into smuggling cocaine into the United States, who was given a lenient sentence of six months in prison by a US court. Ecuador's new legislation appears to take an extra step in this direction, overthrowing a previous Code that had been heavily criticized by current President Rafael Correa and other politicians for its disproportionate sentences. However, the reforms may create new legal difficulties in distinguishing between willing and unwilling mules. As it is dependent on cooperation as a witness, people who carry drugs purely for personal gain may claim victim status for their own benefit, while those forced into it may stay silent for fear of repercussions for them or their families."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Mexico Rescues 73 Kidnapped Migrants. Mexican authorities have rescued 73 people from a house in the north of the country, further evidence of the vulnerability of migrants to kidnapping and extortion at the hands of organized crime. On September 30, Mexican authorities discovered the captives in the border city of Reynosa, in the northeastern Tamaulipas state, reported Vanguardia. Thirty-seven of the victims were Mexican, while the rest were from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Among the group of 56 males and 17 females were six minors. Some of the victims had been apparently kidnapped from buses or at bus stations and held for up to four months. The captors had called victims' family members to demand money in exchange for their freedom, reported Proceso. Authorities discovered the migrants after two subjects of a police chase attempted to hide in the house, reported Informador. Three people have been arrested in connection with the case. Criminal organizations in Mexico have systematically target migrants for extortion or forced labor and Tamaulipas State -- as a major thoroughfare for migrants attempting to cross the US border into Texas -- has witnessed some brutal crimes against migrants, including the massacre of 72 people in 2010. In 2011 a mass grave was found in the state containing more than 200 bodies, believed to be migrants. Both incidents were later linked to the Zetas. See Also: Violence Against Migrants Series Migrants taking the dangerous routes through central Mexico toward the US, known as the ""migrant train,"" are vulnerable to organized crime and known to be extorted for fees as high as $20,000 to ensure safe passage. Female migrants often fall victim to Mexico's growing sex trafficking industry. According to Mexico's National Commission on Human Rights (CNDH), as many as 22,000 migrants -- many from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala -- are kidnapped in Mexico each year. The number of Central Americans trying to cross the Mexico-US border has dropped in recent years , due to several factors including economic improvement in their home region, increased violence in northern Mexico and a US crackdown on border security. However this latest incident demonstrates that there are still large numbers of people prepared to risk the journey in the hope of a better life in the United States."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Tracking Down Bolivias Narco-Planes. Drug flights between the Peru-Bolivia air bridge have a relatively brief yet intense history. Hundreds of flights have created a new drug boom, especially in Peru's Apurimac and Ene River Valley (VRAE). These drug flights have also created a frequently updated list of aerial accidents. It is illustrative of the precariousness which the feared aerial traffickers -- who are mostly Bolivian -- are all too willing to face, for the sake of making money. The line between landing and crashing the plane is a thin one. The planes frequently end up smashed in the jungle. If the wreckage if found, a small group of police intelligence investigators will then begin a stubborn attempt to recreate what happened to the plane -- and who were the owners. This article was previously published by IDL Reporteros , and was translated with permission. See the original here. On Saturday, September 5, another police patrol came to a mountain -- this time, in the Valle de Vilcabamba jungle, in Cusco -- in order to find the wreckage of a plane that crashed on August 22. After waiting out a day due to bad weather, the patrol was transferred by two Mil Mi-17 helicopters to the mountain. There, they found the remains of the Bolivian plane. There wasn't much left, but it was enough. It was a CP-2838 flight. The remains told nearly the exact same story as another accident , which happened in a different place and time in the Peruvian jungle. The CP-2838 had been exported to Bolivia in 2013 by Martin Rapozo. In Bolivia, the aircraft was registered as belonging to Sandra Datzer Rodriguez, the wife of Fernando Rapozo, Martin's brother. Fabricated in 1980, the aircraft had once been operational in Anchorage, Alaska -- same as the other plane, the CP-2890, whose tragic end is described here. According to the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the planes belonged to different owners, but were acquired the same month by Rapozo -- July 2013 -- and subsequently exported to Bolivia. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) registration for a plane later exported to Bolivia, to be used for drug flights. C/o IDL Reporteros. Of course, a plane can serve many uses. But these two -- bought the same month, in the same city, by Rapozo -- were used for only one purpose. As previously reported , the CP-2890 was recently found in the Peruvian jungle, alongside the body of the pilot and a 356.5 kilo shipment of cocaine. The CP-2838, which was found just recently -- crashed in Vilcabamba, loaded with cocaine. According to the information that IDL-Reporteros and Caretas has been able to collect, the pilot survived the accident and was able to communicate with someone in Bolivia via satellite phone. According to the sources consulted, the owners of the drug shipment sent another plane to Peru, in order to drop off a survival kit for the pilot. Afterwards, at least two groups of people equipped with cell phones left the town of Llochegua. After a long walk -- with help from local residents -- they found the plane. It seems as though everyone -- including the pilot and the cocaine -- left the area just before the police arrived. Thus, the two planes that Marin Rapozo bought in July 2013 in Anchorage, Alaska, were used to traffic drugs, until they both crashed. Seems clear, doesn't it? But that's not all. A drug plane that crashed near Peru's Ene river, in July 2014. Photo c/o IDL Reporteros. Martin Rapozo exported more than 30 planes from the United States to Bolivia. And -- judging by what we know thus far -- he was able to do this with impunity for several years. The closest thing to an unwilling Kamikaze may be a Bolivian flying a drug plane. Another plane crash -- registered August 22, 2014 -- gives us some idea of how long Rapozo was involved in exporting and operating drug planes. That day, the remains of another plane wreck -- serial number CP-2571 -- was found in Boca Sanibeni, Satipo. Only the body of the pilot was found there. The closest thing to an unwilling Kamikaze may be a Bolivian flying a drug plane. In 2008, six years before the accident, the plane had been exported to Bolivia by Christine Urnezis Rapozo, Martin's wife. They both lived in Tarpon Springs, Florida. In Bolivia, the plane was registered under the name of Luis Alberto Suarez, a rancher with past ties to drug trafficking. Seven years later, in February 2015, Rapozo continued exporting planes to Bolivia. That month, a Cessna TU206G -- acquired by Rapozo three months earlier -- had its US license canceled and was exported to Bolivia. In total, Rapozo and his family exported 33 planes to Bolivia in order to be used for drug trafficking, according to the evidence that emerged from numerous accidents, sightings, and arrests. A family tree of the Rapozo clan. C/o IDL Reporteros. Sometimes Rapozo exported the planes to himself. This is what happened with aircraft CP-2812, which crashed (yes, another one) in November 2014 in Constitucion, Oxapampa. The aircraft -- which previously had the gringo serial number of N9497R -- was exported to Bolivia in September 2013 by Rapozo Export, which has Rapozo's house listed as the company's address, in Tarpon Springs, Florida? The owner of the plane in Bolivia? Martin Rapozo, who listed his occupation as as ""rancher"" and ""civilian pilot."" According to what Bolivian and Peruvian police anti-drug intelligence were able to establish, there were other times when Rapozo exported planes to likely frontmen. Eight of these were identified by the Bolivian anti-drug force, the FELCN. You would think that the US would try harder to ensure that junky US planes are not exported to Bolivia Originally from Bolivia's northeastern Beni state, Rapozo has a pilot's license in the US and a few businesses in Tarpon Spring. Curiously enough, he and his wife once filed for bankruptcy in southern Florida, according to court documents. Nevertheless, Rapozo has 10 planes -- out of the 33 that were exported to Bolivia -- registered to his name. How does a scheme like this operate with impunity for so many years? Given the amount of effort that the US Embassy has put into ensuring that Peru does not implement an aerial interdiction program , you would think that they would try harder to ensure that junky US planes are not exported to Bolivia, and used repeatedly in drug flights until they crash somewhere in the Peruvian jungle. This was not the case for another company: Pilotmec Aircraft Services Inc., based in Pembroke Pines, in Broward, Florida. This company exported a plane to Bolivia in 2013, where it was registered until the serial number of CP-2821. It was immediately put to use towards drug flights, until it crashed during an attempted take-off from the Peruvian town of Paquichari, on the Ene river, in May 2015. Shortly afterwards, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) arrived to Pilotmec headquarters in Pembroke Pines and seized three planes. According to reliable sources, they also seized a list of another 17 aircraft that were set to be exported to Bolivia. Pilotmec had also sold planes to the Rapozo family, in Bolivia. This wasn't the only DEA action in Florida. Last March, alongside Border Patrol agents, they inspected the Opa Locka airport and seized a Cessna 206. The plane had just landed from Key West, and was preparing for a longer flight, to Bolivia. The pilot indicated that he would have been paid $2,000 to do so. Instead of making the trip to Bolivia, the venerable Cessna, first fabricated in the 1970s, was seized. Perhaps the Peruvian jungle was saved from another plane crash. Nevertheless, the Rapozos and groups continued arriving to Bolivia, forming part of the cocaine air bridge, with all of its terrifying landings, unlucky take-offs, and almost inevitable crashes. You would think that before Peru begins its aerial interdiction program, the cocaine air bridge will end itself, due to all the accidents. But in the meantime, so long as there's no effective interdiction, the Rapozos and other groups will ensure there's no shortage of junky planes moving drug shipments across the skies.

"El Salvador Stays Firm Against Gang Truce as Conflict Intensifies. In a clear sign that El Salvador has shelved another gang truce, government officials moved gang leaders into a maximum security prison, amidst more violence between police and gang members. El Faro reported that the government transferred four leaders of the MS13 and three leaders of a Barrio 18 faction to Zacatecoluca maximum security prison. When the government negotiated a gang truce between the MS13 and Barrio 18 in 2012, gang leaders asked to be moved to prisons where they could enjoy more benefits, in exchange for ordering an end to violence. The government conceded, not without controversy. Now, three of the gang leaders who participated in those 2012 negotiations -- two from the Barrio 18 and one from the MS13 -- were among the seven moved back into Zacatecoluca. Meanwhile, clashes between police and gangs continue. On February 12 , police killed two alleged gang members in a reported shoot-out that also left one police officer wounded. This follows an attack that alleged gang members launched against a police station , and another gun battle in which two reported gang members -- after being shot -- threw themselves into a river while trying to get away, according to police. Violence against police in El Salvador is intensifying , which prompted the police director to say that officers ""should use weapons against criminals"" with ""complete confidence."" In late January, MS13 and Barrio 18 gang leaders announced that they had committed to a new truce , and said they would be interested in ""a serious peace process"" should the government respond. The transfer of the gang leaders into Zacatecoluca isn't a surprise -- in mid-January, the government said some gang leaders had already been moved there. In doing so, not only is the government reversing one of the privileges they originally granted gang leaders in exchange for reduced violence, they are demonstrating a total lack of interest in granting what gang members call ""favorable conditions"" for any possible ""peace process."" It remains to be seen whether gang leaders will sustain their new gang truce in light of this move. That may depend on whether the gangs' leaders want to use this truce as an opportunity to highlight police involvement in driving up El Salvador's violence rates, or whether they decide it is in their best interest to commit their resources to an all-out war against the authorities. Either way, police will likely continue to report shoot-outs as having been instigated by alleged gang members -- an assertion that is worth questioning. Notably, the director of El Salvador's forensics institute recently said that police blame many homicides on gang members while lacking the evidence to back up such accusations."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"FARC Demobilization Could Threaten Costa Rica Security: Minister. Authorities in Costa Rica are worried that the dismantling of Colombia's main guerrilla group could threaten the Central American country's stability, as a new generation of criminal networks are likely to take over the drug routes formerly held by the insurgents. Speaking before the congressional Security and Drug Trafficking Commission, Security Minister Gustavo Mata said the demobilization of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) will allow new and smaller organized crime groups to expand into Costa Rica, reported Diario Extra. Mata said that he expects a large number of the weapons that are supposed to be surrendered by the FARC will fall into the hands of Costa Rican gangs. ""I hope they turn them in,"" Mata said, referring to the FARC's weapons. ""But I know that is not going to happen."" The weapons ""are going to come [to Costa Rica], along with coca, for one simple reason,"" the security minister continued. ""These organizations are going to want to position themselves in the region, they are going to give arms to the small groups in order for them to engage in internal fights that we are seeing in Costa Rica."" As evidence of this, Mata pointed to the arrest of 11 individuals and the seizure of seven firearms -- including AK-47 and M16 rifles -- on February 14, while calling for a more heavy handed approach to fighting drug trafficking. (There do not appear to be any indications that those weapons were linked to the FARC.) Amid a trend of rising violence linked to criminal activities, Costa Rica has recently stepped up the fight against drug trafficking. The country has purchased new radars to patrol its shores and has hired and trained new police officers, Mata remarked. The United States also recently donated two anti-narcotics ships that will begin patrolling Costa Rica's coastlines by the end of 2017. While Costa Rica has long been a crucial transit spot for traffickers wishing to smuggle Colombian cocaine to the United States, the dismantling of the FARC could change the dynamics of the Central American country's security situation. Originally used as a meeting point for Mexican and Colombian crime groups to seal deals on cocaine shipments heading to the United States, since the mid-2000s Costa Rica has turned into a major transhipment hub for Colombian drugs and now serves as a point of operations for some transnational criminal groups. Costa Rica's Attorney General Jorge Chavarria recently said Mexican drug cartels are recruiting Costa Rican criminals and taking them to Mexico, where they are taught cartel strategies and ways to adopt them back home. The relationship between Jamaican and Costa Rican trafficking networks has also reportedly grown stronger as Costa Rican gangs are allegedly swapping cocaine for Jamaican marijuana, which authorities believe is now both sold in Costa Rica and exported abroad in large amounts. Additionally, police operations in 2015 uncovered the presence of the infamous Italian crime syndicate known as the 'Ndrangheta in the Central American country. For their part, the FARC have long been a key player in Costa Rica, and have reportedly used the country to evade capture , hide their assets and set up drug and arms trafficking networks. The guerrilla group's demobilization could give FARC splinter groups and other criminal networks a chance to increase their operations in the country. Not only could this lead to an increase in the quantity of drugs smuggled into Costa Rica, it could also lead to a surge in the number of weapons handled by local gangs if foreign crime groups are to arm them as Mata predicted."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Border Patrol Busts Cell Phone Human Smuggling Ring. The U.S. Border Patrol has arrested eight men in connection with a migrant smuggling ring that guided its clients over the California-Mexico border using cell phones, instead of escorting them in person. The tiny town of Jacumba sits in a valley on the U.S.-Mexico border across from La Rumorosa, Mexico, about 75 miles east of San Diego. Instead of relying on ""coyotes"" to guide the migrants on foot, this smuggling ring used cell phones and binoculars from their observation points on nearby mountaintops to direct migrants across the border, where they would be picked up in rental cars and driven to Los Angeles. Border Patrol agents have detected this type smuggling rings more frequently as cell phone coverage expands to rural areas and the cost of such technology decreases. A Homeland Security agent said that this was likely the first smuggling ring ""uncovered that relied exclusively on cell phone technology ."" By arresting and pressuring the ""chauffeurs"" who drove the migrants to the city , who included high-school students and housewives, U.S. authorities gained information on a pair of cousins who allegedly directed the U.S. side of the operation. The eight men arrested face federal charges of conspiracy to smuggle aliens. "	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Speculation on Homicide Rate Distracts from Real Issues in Mexico. The annual race to chart Mexico's homicide rates has begun, but an examination of the claim that the drug-related killings have levelled off shows the inadequacy of this measure. Some news outlets have kicked off by reporting that drug-related homicides in Mexico may have plateaued. However, tracing the trail of such data shows the futility of trying to use this metric to understand Mexico's crime problem and ignores the more important question of how to lower the actual murder rate. Homicide stats in Mexico are a tricky and politically-charged business. Media, analysts and politicians play around with big numbers at their own peril. The most recent example was Alma Guillermoprieto, whose New York Review of Books blog, "" Day of the 40,000 Dead ,"" drew ire from Mexico watchers. ""I would point out that continuing to repeat the 40,000 number is wrong,"" wrote Molly Molloy , who compiles the influential and very informative Frontera listserv. ""The Mexican government's official tally of 'drug war homicides' [as they define it] was 34,612 at the end of 2010. To think that only 5,388 people have been added to that toll in nearly 11 months is ludicrous."" The problem begins with the various sources used to determine drug-related homicides. In her post, Molloy cites several different government sources. But other sources are more like a breadcrumb trail. The recent reports, for example, about murders reaching a plateau come from Sign On San Diego and the Latin American Herald Tribune. They used preliminary data from Trans-Border Institute (TBI) that suggests drug-related murders are increasing at a slower rate than in previous years. However, in an email exchange with InSight Crime, a TBI representative explained that its 2011 mid-year data that led to the articles is based on La Reforma newspaper's ""Ejecutometro,"" a running tally of publicly reported killings. TBI is also comparing this newspaper's data with government data that shows a 2010 end-of-year figure of 15,273 drug-related murders. In sum, the recent news reports are based on a combination of newspaper and government data that is channeled through a university but is both preliminary and sketchy (as noted by the same university that is gathering these tallies). To be sure, news organizations are filling an important hole in this debate. As the murder rate related to organized crime rose in 2007, the government did not provide statistics, which left news organizations scrambling to quantify the violence. But as the homicides have increased, so have the differences in news organizations' tallies. Zeta magazine, for example, estimated that there were 19,546 organized crime-related killings in 2010, much higher than the estimates of La Reforma (11,583) or the government. Expect similar differences between media again this year. There are also wide discrepancies within the government's own data. Last year, as InSight Crime noted, the Attorney General's Office released data that was very different from the presidency's estimates of drug-related murders. At the heart of these inconsistencies is a difference in methodology. Zeta uses the number of intentional homicides committed by firearm but also includes data on intentional homicide by ""other"" or ""unknown"" means, which would include the many victims of violence that have been beheaded, disemboweled, hung from bridges or found buried in mass graves, but not shot by a firearm. La Reforma's classification depends on the type of weapon and the way it was employed (e.g., execution style); how many dead; whether there are markings on the body or if it is mutilated; whether there are signs or symbols near the dead; official reports indicating the connection to organized crime; the presence of weapons and/or high volumes of cash at the crime scene. The presidency uses three categories (download methodology here ): executions, confrontations, and aggressions. The vast majority of these murders are classified as executions, which the presidency says have certain characteristics such as multiple victims, a message from a rival drug trafficking organization, and signs of execution-style killings. But even this is somewhat arbitrary. As Molloy points out in her post, the only part of this equation that seems clear is that the total number of homicides have increased. Classifying these homicides without proper judicial investigations and records is pure guesswork. A bigger problem may be the use of these statistics as the main barometer of criminal activity in Mexico. Indeed, the optimistic assessment from these media sources also failed to consider other forms of violent crime and ignored how violence has spread to new areas, making some parts of Mexico more dangerous than ever. Homicides are obviously not the only form of drug related violence in Mexico. President Felipe Calderon's approach to fighting drugs has changed the dynamics of organized crime , fragmenting the cartels. The new, smaller groups are increasingly involved in other criminal activities, like extortion and kidnapping , and have pushed crime into new parts of Mexico. According to the Citizen's National Observatory (ONC), the number of kidnappings, extortions and violent robberies is on the rise in 2011. The increase in these high-impact crimes has been felt across Mexico, but particularly in areas that saw very little violence until recently. The worst part of this debate may be its futility. Media, analysts, academics and government institutions should spend more time trying to understand what causes violence to fluctuate. They could measure, for instance, the cumulative effect of years of international investment in the security sector and domestic funding for federal and state police forces, and whether this has increased Mexico's police investigative capacity. They could assess whether the implementation of major judicial reforms is improving the ability of prosecutors to convict criminals, using forensic evidence gathered by police investigators , and thus reducing Mexico's high rate of impunity for criminals. They could also explore questions that have caused controversy in the United States when assessing its plummeting homicide rates, namely, incarceration rates and demographics. Specifically, Steven Levitt, of Freakonomics fame, argues that four factors account for the dramatic and sustained decrease in violence in the U.S. over the past several decades (pdf version of Levitt's 2004 article available here ). The declining popularity of crack cocaine, the legalization of abortion in the 1970s, the increase in the number of police officers on U.S. streets and the enormous growth in prison populations due to much harsher penalties for drug offenses and mandatory minimum sentencing. It would appear that Mexico is applying this logic to its own problems, at least in part. Mexico's armed forces and police have arrested thousands of suspected criminals in recent years, and jails are close to 20 percent over capacity (pdf report on prison population available here ). However, two things are worth pointing out here. First, there is a great deal of debate over the social costs of mass imprisonment and whether it is a cost-effective and sustainable response to high levels of crime. Second, because of an underresourced and overwhelmed judicial system, only 42 percent of the nearly 220,000 people incarcerated in Mexico have even been sentenced for a criminal act, which suggests that, even if the logic behind mass incarceration was correct, it may not work for Mexico. So, just as mass imprisonment in the U.S. may have hastened the end of the crack-related crime wave of the 1980s, Mexico watchers should ask themselves if incarcerating thousands of Mexico's young men can lower levels of violent crime over the next decade. Using preliminary data that is both questionable and varies from source to source, the answer appears to be no. "	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Micro-trafficking Capo Arrested Over Mexico City Heaven Murders. Police have arrested the alleged mastermind of the kidnapping and murder of 13 youths in Mexico City, marking the final stages of the investigation into the notorious ""Heaven"" case, which has broken the myth that organized crime has not penetrated the capital. Police arrested Javier Rodriguez Fuentes, alias ""El Javi,"" almost exactly a year after 13 youths were abducted from the bar ""Heaven,"" murdered, dismembered and buried in a mass grave. Authorities have been hunting Rodriguez, who they say is a leader of the local organized crime group Union de Insurgentes, since his alleged accomplices identified him as the intellectual author of the crime, reported Milenio. The capture of Rodriguez takes the number of people arrested in the case to 24, with police still searching for 11 more. The Heaven case has fatally undermined claims that Mexico City has managed to avoid the influence of violent organized crime, although questions remain over the links between the local criminals behind the killings and national drug cartels. The story that has emerged is one of revenge, drugs, and turf wars that can be traced to the division of one criminal organization, La Union. La Union controlled micro-trafficking, extortion and the movement of stolen goods in and around the city's nightlife center, the Zona Rosa. The group split following the loss of their leadership a decade ago, with one faction calling itself the Union de Insurgentes, the other the Union de Tepito or the Tepito Cartel. The dispute between the two sides has often spilled over into violence , but before the Heaven case the Insurgentes were believed to have the upper hand. In May 2013, a drug dealer working with the Insurgentes faction was executed by members of the Tepito organization. In response, Rodriguez ordered the kidnapping and murder of the 13 youths -- just two of whom were related to men involved in the murder. While the story of the Heaven killings as it stands suggest the motive was a dispute between local criminal groups competing over local revenues, these groups have been connected to larger organizations. According to some reports , they are also involved in large scale drug trafficking; the Tepito faction has been connected to the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO), and the Insurgentes with the Familia Michoacana. With authorities reporting that arrests in the case have dismantled the Insurgentes , the question is whether any of these larger groups will forge new local alliances to capitalize on the vacuum. There have already been reports of the Sinaloa Cartel looking to profit from micro-trafficking in Mexico City, as well as recent reports of a possible Gulf Cartel presence."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Belize Arrests Fuel Reports of MS13 Gang Presence. Police in Belize have arrested six suspects allegedly linked to the MS13 for attempted extortion and arson, in a case that supports earlier reports the transnational street gang is setting up shop in this vulnerable Central American nation. Belize City resident Edwin Flores was detained on July 22 along with his girlfriend in a police sting operation, after a local businessman told police the couple had demanded he pay them $8,000. After Flores' girlfriend received the cash, police arrested the couple and four associates. One of the men was also wanted for armed robbery and confessed to committing a recent deadly arson attack, reported the Guardian. Authorities believe Flores and the four other male suspects are members of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) street gang, reported Channel 5 Belize. Flores has been charged with blackmail and -- along with the other detainees -- displaying gang insignia, reported CTV 3 News. According to Senior Police Superintendent Edward Broaster, the MS13 maintains operations in Belize, but these are generally focused on extortion. Their activities are less violent than in nearby El Salvador, making it harder for police to detect the gang's operations, reported Channel 5 Belize. There have been reports of an MS13 presence in Belize since at least 2003, according to a 2012 La Prensa Grafica article that claimed both that gang, and its Barrio 18 rivals, had increased their presence in the tiny Central American nation -- which has a large Salvadoran population -- in recent years. The newspaper also reported that an unnamed Salvadoran gang with 400 members operated in the Cayo District, where capital city Belmopan is located. Since then, there have been scattered reports of authorities in Belize capturing suspected MS13 members. Nonetheless, it may be the case that alleged MS13 activity is really that of Belize's many local gangs posing as maras to provoke fear -- as has been known to happen in neighboring Honduras. The MS13 was founded by Salvadoran refugees in California in the 1980s and has since expanded to the East Coast of the United States and into Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. The March arrests of 35 alleged MS13 members in Spain indicate the group has established a presence in that European country as well. As the MS13 continues to expand, Belize could become a strategic operating platform. The state's weak central government has helped make it a center for money laundering , and its location next to Central America's principal drug transit nations also makes it potentially useful as a transshipment point. Meanwhile, the violent turf war currently being waged by numerous local gangs could offer an opportunity for the MS13 to expand while homegrown groups are engaged in conflict.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Can Governments Deter Violence Committed by Crime Groups?For decades, governments throughout Latin America have responded to violent criminal groups with militarized campaigns aimed -- in many cases futilely -- at dismantling or destroying them. These crackdowns often exacerbate violence, but there may be a better way to handle the problem. A recent book by University of Chicago professor Benjamin Lessing, titled "" Making Peace in Drug Wars ,"" lays out the case for an approach he calls ""conditional repression."" The thrust of his argument is that governments can deter criminal organizations from committing violence against the state by focusing increased repression on more violent groups. While Lessing's study concentrates specifically on anti-state violence, he says conditionality can also be applied to other types of criminal behavior. ""You can use the threat of state repression, or the threat of law enforcement, to deter whatever you want,"" he told InSight Crime. But, Lessing said, the state has to make clear what kind of behavior it is trying to discourage, and it has to signal the consequences of engaging in it. ""Whatever thing you're trying to deter, you need to have a bright line,"" he said. Repression in Rio Lessing explores three case studies from Latin America to illustrate how conditional policies have played out in practice. The ""most obviously conditional policy"" examined in the book, he writes, is Rio de Janeiro's "" pacification "" strategy. The initiative was conceived in the late 2000s to address high rates of violence in Brazil's second-largest city, particularly in the disadvantaged neighborhoods known locally as ""favelas."" The primary aim of pacification was not the dismantling of the drug trade, but rather the establishment of a state presence in areas traditionally dominated by crime groups. In order to accomplish this, officials gave advanced notice of their intent to sweep into favelas with large numbers of security forces. This gave members of crime groups ""a chance to flee or disarm and melt into favela society,"" Lessing writes. After occupying the targeted area and establishing a special outpost known as a Police Pacification Unit (Unidade de Policia Pacificadora - UPP), authorities deprioritized enforcement of laws against drug trafficking in favor of seeking to keep levels of violence to a minimum. Initially, pacification was widely praised for bringing about dramatic drops in violence in the areas where it was implemented. However, Lessing says, the program eventually became a victim of its own success. ""Pacification proved that you can reduce violence,"" the author told InSight Crime. ""You can convince the drug traffickers, at least for a while, to put down their arms."" But, he added, ""When these programs exhibit initial success there will be this demand to replicate the program."" As authorities moved to implement UPPs in more favelas, resources were stretched thin. A resurgence of violence followed, including incidents of excessive force by police, undermining support for the initiative. ""It couldn't be scaled up quickly enough, not in a way that would stay true to the principles of the program,"" Lessing said. Conditionality in Colombia Lessing also considers the case of Colombia during the 1980s and 1990s, the heyday of Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel. He argues that the Colombian government's unconditional crackdown on drug trafficking beginning in the early 1980s pushed the Medellin Cartel to carry out wanton violence as a means of trying to pressure the government into changing course. Eventually, after the 1990 election of President Cesar Gaviria, the government did change course. Gaviria's administration came up with a policy known as ""sometimiento,"" which offered judicial leniency to drug trafficking suspects who voluntarily turned themselves in. Lessing argues that the policy was conditional, ""implicitly offering forgiveness for past violence conditional on nonviolence going forward."" And, he argues, sometimiento succeeded in containing Escobar's penchant for bloodshed -- until the drug lord made an infamously embarrassing escape from prison, resulting in a year-and-a-half-long manhunt that ended in his death. Lessing says that the declining violence seen in post-Escobar Colombia is the result of a different type of conditional policy, which a former US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) official he interviewed described as ""mowing the lawn"" -- essentially, ""targeting the most prominent and troublesome traffickers for repression and extradition."" Militarization in Mexico The third case study in the book examines Mexico's spiraling drug war , which has been a major driver of the country's record-high homicide rates in recent years. Lessing argues that, although deeply corrupt, the policy toward drug trafficking practiced by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional - PRI), which ruled Mexico for most of the 20th century, was nonetheless a type of conditional repression that helped keep levels of violence low. As long as crime groups paid bribes and avoided bloodshed, they faced no repression, and thus had little motivation to commit violence. This system began to erode in the 1990s when Mexico's political system became more democratic and previously sidelined political parties began to gain power. This shift disrupted the corrupt but stable relationships between criminal organizations and the state. As trafficking groups increasingly turned to violence, the government ramped up repression in an unconditional manner, with former President Felipe Calderon's ""war without quarter"" the prime example, thereby encouraging crime groups to fight back. According to Lessing, the lack of conditionality in Mexico is a key reason why violence has continued to escalate there. ""With stakes so high, and with leaders explicitly promising not to condition repression on cartel behavior, is it any wonder that bribe negotiations became so violent?"" he writes. Constraints on Conditionality If conditional policies are so successful at containing criminal violence, why aren't they more widely adopted? Lessing names two broad categories of constraints that he says policymakers face in implementing conditional security strategies. The first type is what he calls ""logistical constraints,"" like fragmented security institutions that are difficult for policymakers to coordinate and get on the same page. Weaknesses in law enforcement and judicial institutions can also undermine conditional policies, as in the case of the overly rapid expansion of Rio's pacification program. Lessing says these types of stumbling blocks are relatively ""straightforward."" Often, what he calls ""acceptability constraints"" -- political distaste for seeming soft on crime or complicit with trafficking -- are the bigger obstacle to effectively implementing conditional strategies. ""The optics of drug policy and the optics of conditional repression are a little wild. They're hard to predict,"" Lessing told InSight Crime. ""Conditional repression doesn't require tackling all of the hard problems, at least not all at once."" He cited the example of El Salvador's gang truce, which has been credited for bringing about dramatic decreases in sky-high homicide rates, but was carried out in a way that ultimately undermined the public's tolerance and policymakers' political will for further government negotiations with gang leaders. ""We have to pay attention to the way we describe these policies,"" Lessing added. ""We have to pay attention to what their observable impacts are going to look like, and we have to anticipate that."" Ultimately, though, Lessing believes conditional policies -- if implemented thoughtfully -- represent a valid alternative to more traditional approaches to controlling criminal violence. ""I think that a lot of police action, especially 'mano dura' policies, runs the risk of aggravating inter-cartel fighting,"" he said. ""What should the state be doing to keep the cartels from fighting each other? That's not something we normally ask."" ""Conditional repression doesn't require tackling all of the hard problems, at least not all at once,"" Lessing added. ""What it requires is using the repressive or coercive force of the state more intelligently or more effectively."""	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Police, Gangs Major Perpetrators of LGBT Violence in El Salvador. Data collected by activists suggest security forces and gang members are the principal perpetrators of violence against members of the LGBTI communities in El Salvador, highlighting the under-prosecution of crimes against sexual minorities in Central America. Karla Avelar, president of the Trans Communication and Training Association (Asociacion Comunicando y Capacitando Trans - COMCAVIS TRANS) in San Salvador, says data her organization collected on over 600 murders of members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual, Transgender, or Intersex (LGBTI) community since 1993 shows that police officers and gang members are the principal perpetrators, reported ACAN-EFE. Activists had to track down and investigate the circumstances of these deaths because there is no public agency in El Salvador that registers the sexual orientation or gender identity of homicide victims. Avelar says that crimes against members of the LGBTI community are not isolated, that they generally follow a certain pattern, and go systematically unprosecuted. She says that transgender men and women are particularly targeted. According to ACAN-EFE, in the first three months of 2016 Avelar's organization has documented 29 cases of sexual minorities forced to flee their homes -- and sometimes the country -- due to threats, extortion, and attempts on their life by police officers or gang members. In 2015 there was a rash of prominent attacks carried out against members of the LGBTI community in El Salvador, including the separate murders of two transgender women and the police-beating of a transgender man. El Salvador's penal code does not include provisions for hate crime penalties for crimes targeting victims based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This is not the first time police and gangs have been identified as principal perpetrators of violence against the LGBTI community in El Salvador. A 2012 report on Sexual Diversity in El Salvador from the International Human Rights Law Clinic at the University of California, Berkeley cites instances of gangs requiring new members to carry out attacks against members of the LGBTI community as part of their initiation. It also documents instances of rape, abuse, and physical attacks carried out by police officers against gay men and trans women in particular. The report echoed Avelar's concerns regarding lack of investigation and prosecution of violence against the LGBTI community, particularly when police officers were named in the complaint. Regionally, civil society organizations in Honduras have also identified police and gangs as principal perpetrators of violence against the LGBTI community. Amid a broader crisis of violence and impunity in El Salvador, in which gangs and security forces are often pitted against each other , the victimization of LGBTI-identified individuals by security forces and gangs alike points to a shared culture of unchecked violent masculinity.	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Costa Rica Sees Growing Demand for Ketamine, Synthetic Drugs. A bumper seizure of ketamine bottles in Costa Rica shows evidence that the Central American country is seeing growth and diversification of its internal synthetic drug market. At the Penas Blancas checkpoint on the Nicaragua border, police arrested a man carrying 200 bottles of ketamine. According to local authorities, the load would fetch around $17,000 if sold in the country. In 2017, Costa Rica's border police seized 800 bottles of ketamine from criminal organizations with a total value of $70,000. But the country only saw two registered assaults on veterinary clinics, where the drug is sold as a common anesthetic for animals. This confirms that most of the merchandise has come over the border from Nicaragua. SEE ALSO : Costa Rica News and Profile In an interview with Diario Extra , Judicial Investigation Agency (Organismo de Investigacion Judicial - OIJ) director, Walter Espinoza, said that ""we have detected entry of the drug particularly from Nicaragua, where the sale of the product is less restrictedsince the substance has a certain level of legality, it moves relatively easily through the market."" Ketamine is considered a powerful sedative. Its effects on the body are varied and emulate strong hallucinogenic sensations, altering the central nervous system. The drug is also known in the area as ""Special K,"" ""Gato"" or ""Kit Kat."" It is sold in powdered or liquid presentation and a single dose can sell for $5. It was only in 2017 that Costa Rica's drug control police (Policia de Control de Drogas - PCD) confirmed the first case of proven sale of ketamine as a recreational drug. They proceeded to dismantle a criminal gang that was distributing the substance in the country, seizing 30 doses of powdered ketamine and three bottles of the drug in its liquid form. The sale of synthetic drugs in Costa Rica has been gaining ground and has become a window of opportunity for small drug traffickers. Since its transportation does not require any major logistics and presents less risk than cocaine trafficking, for example, gangs are increasingly turning to ketamine. Ketamine is among the most popular drugs in the country, according to information fromthe Costa Rican Drug Institute (Instituto Costarricense de Drogas - ICD), along with marijuana and K2, also known as ""crispy"" or synthetic marijuana. This also shows the consolidation of a market that is increasingly attractive among young people. SEE ALSO : Report Unravels Transnational Strands of Costa Rica Drug Trade Costa Rica has historically been considered a drug trafficking transit spot due to its strategic location. However, the increase of internal usage and recent seizure seem to be changing its landscape from only being a transit route to having an, albeit small, internal market. According to the ICD's 2017 National Situation of Drugs and Related Activities (Situacion Nacional Sobre Drogas y Actividades Conexas de 2017) report , recent seizures recorded a significant increase of synthetic drugs that year, of 1,437 percent for ecstasy and 1,213 percent for LSD. With higher availability, the usage of illicit drugs in Costa Rica will only continue to increase, and local groups will take advantage of this to increase their profits. These kinds of scenarios create disputes among criminal organizations that seek control of the market and inevitably generate a rise in violence, which increased in 2018. Regionally, criminal networks in Latin America are capitalizing on the demand for ketamine and selling it on international markets. The most recent case is Colombia, where an organization was filling action figurines with ketamine pills , to send to China, Mexico, the United States, Argentina and Ecuador, according to a report by local authorities."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Are Mara Salvatrucha Gangs Expanding in Costa Rica?The head of the Honduran armed forces has claimed that powerful gangs are expanding their presence in Costa Rica, but the extent of this criminal migration might be overstated. In a recent interview with Costa Rican news outlet Diario Extra , Francisco Alvarez Urbina said that the Honduran military's anti-crime efforts have driven some members of the Barrio 18 and MS13 gangs into nearby countries like Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Previous reports have indicated that Barrio 18 and MS13 have begun to expand their presence outside their traditional stronghold in Central America's ""Northern Triangle"" of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. In 2012, Salvadoran media outlets, citing police reports, claimed these gangs had established a presence in Belize. And in 2014, Nicaraguan news sources suggested that hundreds of gang members affiliated with MS13 were operating in the north of that country. The Honduran military chief said that some of this migration may be due to the gangs seeking to build connections with transnational drug trafficking groups, in order to supplement the revenues they derive from kidnapping and extortion. ""We have had information on [gang members'] approaching drug cartels,"" Alvarez said. There are many reasons why groups like Barrio 18 and MS13 would want to establish a presence in Costa Rica. Costa Rican security forces do not currently employ anti-gang tactics as aggressive as those in the Northern Triangle, and the country plays an increasingly important role as a transit point for drugs, which has likely contributed to the growth of lucrative domestic drug markets. However, Diario Extra reported that Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Unit has captured 11 members of Barrio 18 and MS13 in the past decade -- hardly signaling a robust presence for either group. Moreover, Costa Rican officials have grown increasingly alarmed by the rising violence associated with drug-trade related turf battles being waged by local gangs. It seems unlikely that sophisticated criminal groups like Barrio 18 and MS13 would forge ahead with expansion plans at a time when Costa Rican authorities are planning to ramp up anti-crime efforts. In sum, Barrio 18 and MS13 probably maintain some presence in Costa Rica, but more substantial evidence points to the evolution of local Costa Rican groups as the major criminal threat facing the country."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
Caribbean Cocaine Trafficking Continues Rise: US Officials. The proportion of drugs trafficked through the Caribbean has more than tripled in the space of five years, according to US officials, adding weight to the persistent warnings that traffickers are seeking new routes as a result of security forces pressure in Central America and Mexico. The head of the Caribbean division of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Vito Salvatore Guarino, told Spain's El Pais that in the last three to five years the amount of cocaine passing through the Caribbean en route to the United States has risen from 5 percent of the total to 16 percent of the total. According to Guarino, in absolute terms, he estimates traffickers currently ship 90-100 tons through the region, versus close to 70 tons in prior years. From October 2012 to October 2013, anti-narcotics forces seized 28 tons of drugs being moved through the region and arrested over 1,500 people on drug charges. This has continued to rise since then, with a 2 percent increase in the proportion of drugs moving through the region during the first trimester of the 2014 fiscal year. The most commonly used routes depart from the port of Cartagena, before moving on to the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, according to Guarino. Jamaica, already a major marijuana producer country, has also emerged as a major cocaine transhipment point. In the three years since Caribbean leaders warned the US of an increase in drug trafficking through the region, it has become increasingly apparent that traffickers are looking to revive the Caribbean cocaine corridors popular in the 1980s, when 75 percent of drugs seized in transit to the United States were interdicted along these routes. At least part of the increased activity along the Caribbean routes is a result of the security forces crackdown in Mexico and Central America, which themselves became popular due to anti-narcotics operations in the Caribbean, highlighting how trafficking routes migrate to follow the path of least resistance. The use of Caribbean ports and transit points has been underscored by recent seizures. In just the last two weeks, two record breaking shipments of liquid cocaine and cocaine were seized by Colombian authorities at the port of Cartagena, one a seven ton load destined for the Netherlands , the other a record 2.8 ton haul of liquefied cocaine , which was headed for Guatemala. In addition, the US Coast Guard recently unloaded 3.3 tons of cocaine at a base in Miami Beach following two separate drug interdictions in the Caribbean, one of which took place just south of Jamaica, the other in the south west Caribbean sea. However, despite the seizures and the warnings of regional officials, the DEA's figures show how the Caribbean remains some distance from taking over as the principal route linking the Andean cocaine production countries to the United States. Authorities believe that about 350 tons of cocaine still moves through the Isthmus.	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Can Ameripol Center Effectively Combat Cyber Crime?Following the most recent Ameripol meeting, national police chiefs announced the creation of a cyber security center to prevent and combat electronic crimes, underscoring growing regional concern over this type of criminal activity and raising questions about the best way to address cyber crime. On August 7, the Police Community of the Americas (Ameripol) announced a new law enforcement institute would be put in place to evaluate and address cyber crime threats, reported Prensa Latina. According to a document released by Ameripol , the center will collect regional data on internet crimes and provide support to law enforcement bodies in the Americas. The proposed initiative includes law enforcement training, the creation of benchmarks, technical assistance and international cooperation with other police organizations. The decision came as a result of an Ameripol meeting that took place in Quito, Ecuador between August 4 and August 6. At the meeting, members also agreed to strengthen efforts to combat human trafficking and corruption, and announced the creation of a pilot information exchange program. Cyber crime is a serious problem in Latin America and costs the region billions of dollars a year. Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have been among the hardest hit countries in the region. According to a report published by RSA Security ( pdf ), in 2013 Colombia and Brazil ranked among the top 10 countries in the world for estimated losses from phishing -- the online theft of financial or personal information -- which cost the countries an estimated $95 million and $86 million, respectively. Several countries in the region have taken steps to combat cyber crime, with Peru and Brazil updating their criminal codes to target illegal internet activities and Colombia creating a special police unit. In 2013, technology company Microsoft announced the establishment of a regional anti-cyber crime office in Bogota, Colombia. Ameripol's decision to create a regional cyber security center will likely provide law enforcement agencies with additional tools to combat cyber crime and assist in the development of best practices to combat the crime in each country. However, it also raises questions about how these types of security threats can be effectively addressed. As a recent case of Russian hackers stealing more than a billion internet passwords demonstrates, cyber theft is a borderless crime, meaning a centralized regional law enforcement hub is unlikely to be enough to stop it. Meanwhile, governments may be wary of sharing too much knowledge, lest they give away key information regarding their own cyber-espionage tactics.	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
"Crime Groups Flooding Guatemala with Illegal Fuel from Mexico. Millions of gallons of illegal petrol are flowing into Guatemala from Mexico each week, part of a highly lucrative regional trade that authorities are struggling to combat. Guatemalan Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla said the trade is controlled by organized crime groups, which use the contraband fuel to turn profit and are thought to launder the money by building new gas stations, reported La Hora. He did not specify which groups were involved, but expressed doubt over earlier suggestions that Mexican criminal group the Zetas were responsible for much of the trade. According to Bonilla, 65 ""blind spots"" have been identified along the more than 500 mile border between the two countries, through which contraband goods flow, with ""eight or nine"" of them thought to be used to move illegal fuel. Guatemalan Association of Fuel Retailers representative Enrique Melendez estimated between 300,000 and 350,000 gallons of illegal fuel enter Guatemala from Mexico each day. ""In losses, if you take 300,000 at an average of 33 quetzals [$4.20 -- per gallon] we're talking about almost nine or ten million quetzals [$1.2 - $1.3 million] each day,"" Melendez told La Hora. The flow of contraband products into Guatemala is on the rise and is currently estimated to cost the country up to $1.6 billion per year, with the majority of losses in tobacco, alcohol and gasoline. The idea that the Zetas have no part in the flow of illegal fuel between Mexico and Guatemala seems optimistic. The Zetas are known to be involved in fuel theft in Mexico , have been linked to contraband fuel shipments heading elsewhere in the region and also have a significant presence in Guatemala -- although their power in that country has waned recently. The trade in contraband fuel is a region wide problem largely driven by major disparities in prices between neighboring countries. The effects of this are most often felt in countries bordering key producer nations like Mexico and Venezuela. Despite having its own oil reserves, Colombia sees significant quantities of contraband fuel flowing in from both Venezuela and Ecuador , where left-leaning governments maintain low prices. In Venezuela -- the region's biggest producer -- petrol is sold cheaper than bottled water, giving rise to the smuggling of hundreds of millions of dollars of fuel , not just across land borders, but also overseas to the Caribbean and Central America."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"US Lacks Evidence Linking Migrant Children to MS13 Crimes. Representatives of three US federal law enforcement agencies were unable to offer the Senate Judiciary Committee any conclusive evidence of links (beyond isolated cases) between groups of unaccompanied minors who arrived in the United States since 2012 and the recent increase in crimes attributed to the MS13 gang in several cities around the country. Certain Republican senators attempted to fuel an increasingly common discourse within the US political sphere and some US media outlets, namely that recent brutal crimes attributed to the MS13 may be directly related to the massive arrival of migrants between the ages of 12 and 17 from Central America's ""Northern Triangle"" -- Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. ""What's even more troubling than the recent surge of MS13 gang violence is the fact the organization has a new, and more disturbing, recruitment strategy: targeting unaccompanied alien children,"" the committee's chair, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, said at the beginning of the hearing. Unaccompanied alien children (UAC) -- the term used by the US government -- were a focal point of testimonies heard during the MS13 hearing on June 21. These testimonies were provided by representatives of the departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice (DOJ), and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This was the US Congress' third hearing about MS13 in less than two months. Officials from the above-mentioned federal agencies have direct contact with minors who enter the United States without documents and unaccompanied by an adult. They also bear administrative responsibility for the treatment of these minors. Of all the undocumented youths who migrated to the United States in the last five years, only about 0.029 percent could have had a relationship with the MS13 upon their arrival. The United States cannot instantly deport UACs due to a 2008 legal reform. Instead, UACs are transferred to HHS before being delivered by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to surrogate households, generally family or acquaintances. If the CBP determines that a minor is suspected of membership or links to the MS13, a report is produced and transferred to DHS. Supporters of the narrative put forth by US President Donald Trump's administration, such as Sen. Grassley or previously Attorney General Jeff Sessions , claim that there is a correlation between the rise in homicides attributed to the MS13 along the East Coast since 2015, and the growing influx of UACs. Based on what was said yesterday in the Senate, however, the administration has very little evidence to support this claim. In fact, interim CBP Chief Carla Provost, one of the witnesses interviewed by the senators, confirmed that border agents suspected no more than 159 UACs to have had gang ties, out of the 188,685 detained minors referred to surrogate households between 2012 and 2017. And only 56 may have links to the MS13 in particular. That is, of all the undocumented youths who migrated to the United States in the last five years, only about 0.029 percent could have had a relationship with the MS13 upon their arrival. When referring to these links, Chief Provost spoke of ""confirmed or suspected gang affiliation."" Provost and others testified that once minors with possible gang affiliations who were detained at the border are sent to homes of acquaintances or relatives, dubbed ""sponsors,"" to await the development of their immigration case, the US federal government has no immediate way of knowing if they maintain active ties to gangs, and much less if they partake in crime. When the senators asked the other officials present if there was any way of knowing how many of the UACs had been linked to crimes attributed to the MS13, the answer, with small nuances, was the same: There are no available statistics. East Coast counties with a strong and decades-old MS13 presence appear to have more information than federal authorities. According to the Washington Post , 42 of the 17,000 children relocated to Washington, DC and the surrounding areas in Maryland and Virginia have been involved in ""MS13 violence"" over the past three years. Again, the figure represents just 0.237 percent of the total. Of the 42 cases confirmed by the Washington Post in court documents or with local authorities, 19 minors have been charged with manslaughter or attempted homicide and four were victims of murder. When discussing the issue, Sen. Grassley's rhetoric was strongly reminiscent of the Trump administration's narrative, which associates Central American migrant communities with MS13 criminal activities. ""Their illegal status and Central American heritage alone make them vulnerable targets for MS13 recruitment efforts,"" the senator said. Wednesday's committee also discussed another argument raised by Washington's official narrative concerning links between UACs and the MS13, namely that the UACs' social and economic vulnerability makes them easy prey for the gang's recruitment in the United States. Dozens of social workers and local officials consulted by InSight Crime since 2014 have concurred on the fact that UACs are indeed vulnerable to recruitment. This is true more generally of all Central American minors fleeing gang-controlled neighborhoods only to be confronted, after a difficult journey to the United States, with dislocated households and gang presence in their schools and their neighborhoods. Faced with increasing gang presence since the 2000s, certain counties surrounding Washington, DC and New York City launched special programs whose purposes included countering recruitment. In places such as Maryland's Mongtomery County, these programs were so successful that they allowed DOJ federal authorities to obtain prison sentences that crippled the gang for nearly a decade. There is little doubt that MS13 activity has increased in the United States since 2015. This is particularly true along the East Coast, where a series of violent murders in Boston's metropolitan area, Long Island in New York and Washington, DC's suburbs shed light on the gang's resurgence after years of hibernation. Discoveries of dismembered corpses in suburban US parks coincided with a revival of gang-related violence in Central America, particularly in El Salvador, which was partly due to the ups and downs of a gang truce negotiated under Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes (2009-2014). But these gruesome discoveries came against a backdrop of an influx of UACs, spurred by deteriorated living and security conditions in the Northern Triangle. These developments created the conditions for a perfect storm. In 2016, InSight Crime published an investigation that looked into the MS13's attempted US expansion via the case study of alias ""Chucky,"" an MS13 member who called a meeting in Richmond, Virginia, toward the end of 2015. Chucky relayed orders from the El Salvador-based leadership and told leaders of cliques on the East Coast -- particularly in Massachusetts -- to double down on recruitment efforts and boost activities. SEE ALSO : The MS13 Moves (Again) to Expand on US East Coast After the meeting, Chucky ordered a hit on a gang leader who refused to follow orders. It is yet uncertain as to whether it was carried out. Chucky's meeting took place in 2015 when the bulk of the UACs were starting to arrive in communities along the East Coast. But there is no shred of evidence that UACs participated in meetings with gang leaders. Chucky held direct contact with leaders incarcerated in El Salvador, not using recently-arrived migrants as intermediaries. In addition, not a single federal agency has made public or revealed in court evidence proof that any UAC suspected of ties with the MS13 who arrived between 2012 and 2017 was part of the gang leadership. The Trump administration has insisted on associating the MS13's resurgence with the increasing number of UACs who, according to officials, carry orders to increase recruitment, extortion and money transfers back to their country of origin. But gang-related remittances are nothing new. One of the very few judicial cases that offered concrete proof concerned a cash transfer from two Maryland clique leaders to Moises Humberto Rivera Luna, alias ""Viejo Santos,"" the leader of the Normandie clique. The case dates back to 2010, long before the influx of UACs. There is no conclusive evidence to date of a correlation between the MS13's resurgence on the East Coast and the flow of undocumented Central American minors to the United States. In addition, related testimonies from gang leaders and federal agents in the Maryland court concurred that the first orders of expansion from the Salvadoran leadership reached the East Coast between 2008 and 2010. During Wednesday's congressional hearing, Minnesota's Democrat Senator Al Franken characterized the Trump administration's MS13-UACs narrative as a political strategy meant to fuel the Republicans' anti-migration political platform. ""I hope today's witnesses are able to speak to how we are working to maintain that trust and respect [between immigrants and law enforcement], notwithstanding the anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies that we've seen emerge from the Trump campaign, and sadly the Trump administration,"" Franken said, adding later that ""Trump made scapegoating a central pillar of his platform."" There is no conclusive evidence to date of a correlation between the MS13's resurgence on the East Coast and the flow of undocumented Central American minors to the United States. And the minors' vulnerability to recruitment in US counties is but a cloud amid the perfect storm of conditions that have fueled the gang."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Is Costa Rica the Next Frontier For the Maras?A new report reveals the presence of street gangs or ""maras"" from the Northern Triangle in Costa Rica, while recent trends in the country's criminal dynamics suggests the influence of the criminal groups in the ""Switzerland of Central America"" may expand. According to Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Body (OIJ), members of the Barrio 18 and MS13 street gangs have maintained a presence in the country since the mid-2000s, reported Diario Extra. Costa Rican authorities have confirmed the arrests of 11 Barrio 18 and MS13 operatives over the past decade in various parts of the country (see Diario Extra's map below). An MS13 member identified only as Paz told Diario Extra he has been living in Costa Rica since 2008. Although Paz is currently serving a 25 year prison term in a Costa Rican prison for drug trafficking and kidnapping, he said he has no interest in eventually moving back to San Salvador, his birth place. ""I had a distributor and a restaurant in Ciudad Neily [a city in southern Costa Rica]. In my country [El Salvador] I can't have anything because I belong to a street gang, and I couldn't permit my children to die of hunger,"" Paz said. Central America's Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras) is the main base of operations for both street gangs, or ""maras,"" with El Salvador being their spiritual headquarters. However, the Barrio 18 and MS13 are known to have a presence in cities throughout the isthmus, as well as Mexico and the United States. Maras have never had a significant presence in Costa Rica, which has undoubtedly helped the country avoid much of the endemic violence that has plagued the Northern Triangle. In 2014, Costa Rica registered a murder rate of 9.5 per 100,000; three times lower than any Northern Triangle country and a far cry from El Salvador and Honduras, which both recorded a homicide rate of over 60 per 100,000. In fact, Costa Rica has become known as the "" Switzerland of Central America "" in part due to its stellar security reputation. However, there has been increasing evidence Costa Rica may no longer deserve that title. Mexican transnational criminal organizations have been active in Costa Rica for years , but it appears their presence is now beginning to the spur the growth of well-armed local gangs. The country's increased importance as a transit point in the transnational drug trade has also likely driven illicit drug consumption; a 2012 report by the Organization of American States (OAS) found Costa Rica's per capita cocaine use is double that of Brazil, the world's second largest consumer market. Meanwhile, authorities attributed the uptick in violence last year to gangs battling for control of the local drug trade. Increasingly profitable domestic drug markets are one pull factor that could attract the maras to Costa Rica. The susceptibility of the judicial system to organized crime is another element that could enable the maras to operate relatively unmolested in Costa Rica. Costa Rica does not have a history of Mano Dura (""Iron Fist"") security policies that have been used in the Northern Triangle to target gangs. El Salvador's aggressive anti-gang policies have reportedly resulted in the migration of some gang members to neighboring Honduras and Guatemala. As violence continues to spiral out of control in El Salvador, maras may be looking further afield for places to relocate, and Costa Rica could be a choice landing spot."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
"Paraguay Captures Members of Brazils PCC. Authorities in Paraguay have captured four members of a PCC cell operating on the country's eastern border with Brazil, reinforcing notions that the Brazilian organized crime group is increasing its presence in its neighboring country. Officers from the country's National Anti-drugs Secretariat (SENAD) arrested the cell's leader Jair Jose dos Santos, alias ""Nain,"" on October 31, alongside three other members, in a house in the border town of Pedro Juan Caballero (see map below), reported ABC Color. According to EFE , the four Brazilians made up an ""armed wing"" of the First Capital Command (PCC), one of Brazil's most powerful organized crime groups, and were wanted on charges of drug trafficking, criminal conspiracy, assault and homicide in their homeland. SENAD chief Luis Rojas said the men would face justice in Brazil and were due to be ""expelled,"" rather than deported, because the deportation process is too time consuming, reported Ultima Hora. ABC Color reported that guns and ""other evidence"" were found in the house where the men were captured. While a PCC presence in Paraguay is nothing new, it is their rivals, the Rio de Janiero-based prison gang Red Command, which are more often associated with Paraguay's drug trade. The Red Command, or Comando Vermelho as it is known, has been reported to ship one ton of cocaine out of Paraguay each month. Earlier this year, Paraguayan authorities dismantled an armed wing of the Red Command in another border town just 60 miles from where the PCC cell was captured. For its part, the PCC is better known for maintaining a heavy presence in Bolivia. However, with Paraguay also a major transshipment points for cocaine and the biggest producer of marijuana in South America (80 percent of which is destined for the domestic market in Brazil, according to the US State Department ), the profits on offer and the rapid expansion of the PCC will likely see it increasing its presence in Paraguay. This trend may be spurred by the high level of impunity drug traffickers enjoy in the country's key trafficking corridors. The department of Amambay, where the PCC cell was captured, is also a key trafficking area where the Paraguayan Peoples' Army (EPP) -- which has been linked to drug trafficking -- is known to have a presence and where it has been suggested Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel may be interested in establishing activities ."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
"US Congress Members Request Investigation of El Salvador Official Linked to Organized Crime. Fourteen members of the US Congress, including Democrats and Republicans, signed a letter on June 21 in which they called upon the Treasury Department to open an official investigation of Salvadoran political leader and current Vice Minister of Foreign Relations Jose Luis Merino for ""long-standing associations with transnational organized criminal networks [that] are the subject of US criminal investigations."" Washington has sent a new message about suspicions regarding Jose Luis Merino, alias ""Ramiro Vasquez"" -- one of the most influential members of the governing Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional - FMLN) -- namely, his possible participation in international networks linked to regional organized crime. This time, the message also comes from the Democrats. And this time, the message is clearer. Congressional Democrats and Republicans believe that Merino's criminal activities pose a ""significant threat"" to US national security. For that reason, they requested that the US Treasury Department open an investigation ""in the national security interests of the United States"" under the Kingpin Act. ""Today, we are writing to request that you use your authority under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act to investigate the US-linked banking activities of Salvadoran citizen, Jose Luis Merino, known also by his nom de guerre Ramiro Vasquez,"" reads the letter signed by congressional officials on June 21 and presented to the Treasury that same day. (A copy of the letter is embedded below.) The signatories highlighted Merino's status as El Salvador's vice minister of foreign relations. ""Mr. Merino is a senior member of El Salvador's governing party [whose] reported long-standing associations with transnational organized criminal networks are the subject of US criminal investigations for cocaine trafficking and money laundering,"" the letter reads. The members of Congress further explained their reasons for requesting an investigation into Merino's finances: ""Multiple open source reports indicate that financial structures controlled by Mr. Merino, currently the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, have acquired hundreds of millions of dollars in unexplained wealth while helping the FARC guerillas in Colombia, corrupt elements of the Venezuelan government, and other criminal groups move funds to safe harbor,"" the letter states. Sources consulted in Washington stated that once the letter is dispatched to the Treasury Department -- which InSight Crime confirmed it was on June 21 -- it falls to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to open an inquiry and initiate investigations. A researcher familiar with OFAC processes, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that the congressional letter is not binding. In other words, while OFAC is not compelled by the letter to open an investigation, the researcher clarified that it would not be typical for the executive branch to ignore a petition of this nature. The Salvadoran Foreign Relations Ministry responded in a press release, claiming that ""there are no grounds sustaining the allegations made, and there are no existing legal proceedings against Vice Minister Jose Luis Merino, neither in El Salvador nor in the United States."" While it is true that there are no legal proceedings against Merino, there is an open investigation by the Attorney General's Office against the vice minister for possible links to arms and drug trafficking. In July 2016, Salvadoran Attorney General Douglas Melendez confirmed that he had received an inquiry in 2014 ""about events relating to Mr. Merino regarding the topic of drugs and arms."" The US State Department says that the congressional letter responds to ""a relative internal process of two US institutions"" and assured that any investigation will work within ""the framework of our legislation and the legal instruments of which we are signatories."" Washington's Renewed Interest in 'Commander Ramiro' Merino's participation in companies funded with Venezuelan money, specifically associations with the conglomerate Alba Petroleos in El Salvador , awakened Washington's curiosity near the end of the 2009 to 2017 term of former US President Barack Obama. In July 2016 , Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio accused Merino of having links to drug trafficking and money laundering. In El Salvador, Merino has an open investigation pending against him in the Salvadoran District Attorney's office for suspicions that he assisted members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) in the trafficking of drugs and arms. That inquiry was opened in 2008, after the Colombian attorney general sent to El Salvador proof of correspondence from FARC leader Raul Reyes -- assassinated in March 2008 -- in which ""Commander Ramiro"" was identified as a FARC intermediary in the purchase of weapons and missiles. According to Reyes' letters, a significant part of the relationship between Marino and the FARC was backed by officials of former President Hugo Chavez's government in Venezuela. Following Rubio's declarations, Attorney General Melendez stated that the 2008 investigations had been reopened, but since then, the case has remained at a standstill. Merino's direct and indirect involvement with various companies financed by Alba Petroleos and his long-standing relationship with the FARC are only the beginning. There is also Merino's alleged connection to Enrique Rais , a Salvadoran businessman whose airplanes were impounded in the United States on account of suspected drug trafficking in 2016. Rais is a fugitive from his own country evading corruption charges that implicate El Salvador's attorney general. Merino recently admitted in a televised interview that Rais is his personal friend, but he denied all other connections to the business tycoon. Two US federal sources confirmed last week to InSight Crime what was revealed in the congressional letter; namely, that in Washington, there are pending investigations opened by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into networks with possible links to Merino. With the letter signed by congressional officials from both parties, the suspicions surrounding Merino -- which the FMLN had previously perceived as political attacks stemming from the Republican Party alone -- have extended to both spheres of the political spectrum represented in the US Congress. The Signatories Before, it was only Marco Rubio and spokespeople from the most conservative sector of the Republican Party -- the FMLN's political adversary and usual collaborator of the Salvadoran right, united under the National Republican Alliance (ARENA) -- that had grumbled over Merino's alleged connections to organized crime. Today, doubts arose on the other side of the aisle, including among the most left-leaning sectors of the Democratic Party. The sponsor of the letter sent to the Treasury Department was Representative Albio Sires, a Democrat from New Jersey and ranking member of the House Western Hemisphere Subcommittee. Among the Republican signatories were Mario Diaz-Balart, Ileana Ros-Lethinen and Carlos Curbelo, all from Florida and traditionally linked to a critical FMLN opposition group. Other signatories from the Republican Party include Ted Yoho, also from Florida; Jeff Duncan, from South Carolina; Christopher Smith, from New Jersey; and Michael McCaul, from Texas. From the other side of the aisle, the Democratic signatories include Eliot Engel from New York, Norma Torres from California, Joaquin Castro from Texas, Gregory Meeks from New York, Robin Kelly from Illinois, and Adriano Espaillat from New York. Engel and Torres were two of the congressional members closest to El Salvador, and both have assisted the FMLN government in US Congress. Since 2014, Torres has become one of the principal voices supporting the anti-corruption fight in Central America, and she is also one of the top supporters of US financial assistance in the region.

"El Salvador Govt Turned Blind Eye to Officials Arms Trafficking. A recent report points once again to the role high-ranking El Salvador military officials play in driving that nation's illicit arms trade, helping fuel rampant gang violence and bloodshed. Since 2010 El Salvador's National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil - PNC) and several other state institutions bought over $500,000 worth of guns, munitions, and bulletproof vests from the arms businesses of retired army major Miguel Angel Pocasangre Escobar, reported La Prensa Grafica. While not the Salvadoran government's largest arms provider, government entities continued to do business with Pocasangre even after he became the subject of arms trafficking allegations. According to La Prensa Grafica, Pocasangre first came to the attention of authorities in 2011 when an undercover agent was able to illegally purchase a weapon from a gun store. Investigations into the case produced a protected witness for El Salvador's Attorney General's Office (Fiscalia General de la Republica - FGR), who alleged that between 2004 and 2005 Pocasangre and another military official, Carlos Zavaleta Moran, worked together to steal weapons from a military arms depot. These weapons were later sold with altered serial numbers. That witness, known as ""William,"" first testified in March 2013, but the FGR would not formally accuse Pocasange of arms trafficking until October 2015. During this interval the PNC, and even the FGR, bought weapons from Pocasange on repeated occasions, despite the testimony denouncing his activities, La Prensa Grafica reported. Some of Pocasangre's alleged clientele also included convicted drug traffickers and money launderers. Pocasangre's case is El Salvador's latest in a long line of official involvement in arms trafficking, yet it is particularly embarrassing given the same government agencies investigating him for arms trafficking continued to purchase supplies from him. Paradoxically, while the Salvadoran government has pledged to stamp out rampant gang violence, members of the military have consistently been implicated in providing weapons to gangs. In October 2015, the same month the FGR brought charges against Pocasangre, authorities arrested a high-ranking officer of the Special Brigade of Military Security for allegedly selling guns to gang members. The month prior, authorities raided the house of a former colonel and found a stockpile of weapons, including sniper rifles, submachine guns, and grenades. Officials believed the stockpile was also intended to be sold to gang members. This illicit arms trade helps fuel a conflict that has made El Salvador the bloodiest nation in the Americas. Nonetheless, El Salvador is not the only Central American nation where an illicit arms trade has underpinned high levels of violence. Neighboring Honduras is awash in illegal firearms, and unregistered weapons have previously been estimated to be used in 80 percent of all crimes in the country. Until officials take serious steps to rid the trade in illicit arms -- and official involvement in this trade -- the region's chronic violence levels can be expected to continue apace."	0	1	0	0	0	0	1
"RawFeed: State Dept Traces Narco Grenades. Retailers in the U.S. are a major source of weapons for Mexican drug trafficking organizations, but many of their armaments are from military sources. A U.S. State Department cable released Monday February 25 by WikiLeaks reveals that Mexican law enforcement recovered grenades, which the U.S government sold to the El Salvadoran military in the early 1990s. One of these grenades, a U.S. military M67 fragmentation grenade, was used in an attack on Televisa, a Monterrey TV station, during their evening news broadcast. Law enforcement officials identified that grenade from the fuse spoon and pull ring left behind at the scene. Three South Korean K400 grenades were recovered in an abandoned armored car believed to have been used by traffickers as a getaway vehicle. The cable requests that U.S. Embassy officials in Seoul, ""discreetly query the Korean government regarding the whereabouts, disposition, and the possibility of any missing stocks,"" of South Korean-made grenades. Another Korean-made K75 grenade was thrown into a nightclub in Pharr, Texas on the U.S. side of the border, where the targets were three off-duty police officers. The grenade did not detonate. Other recovered military hardware described in the cable includes 14 more U.S.-made M67 grenades, an unexploded U.S. M26A2 fragmentation grenade hurled at the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey on Oct. 21, 2008, 21 unidentified grenades from a narco warehouse, 25 40mm projectiles, and a U.S. M203 40mm grenade launcher, Another cable provides detail of the case against Mexican Army Major Arturo Gonzalez, who was arrested on Dec. 21, 2008 for assisting drug trafficking organizations (DTO). The Jan. 20, 2009 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City says Gonzalez, ""stands accused of leaking military intelligence, training [Arturo Beltran Leyva Organization] hit men through a private security company and supplying military weapons to various DTOs, including los Zetas."" Gonzalez was paid $100,000 a month for his services, beginning in 2005, according to the cable. At the time of his arrest, Gonzalez was a part of President Felipe Calderon's security team. He is accused of passing information about Calderon's travel schedule and Calderon's medical records to the cartels. ""The arrest represents the most serious security breach to date but is not surprising given high-level civilian Government of Mexico (GOM) corruption charges over the past six months,"" the cable says. William W. Cummings is a freelance reporter working on American University's Investigative Reporting Workshop's "" Gunrunners "" project in partnership with InSight, PBS Frontline, and the Center for Public Integrity.

"US Charges Point to Rampant Corruption at Venezuela State Oil Company. US authorities are charging a network of Venezuelan elites and international financial actors with laundering over a billion dollars stolen from the state-owned oil company, illustrating once again how corruption has ransacked the South American country, and why it can be considered a mafia state. Businessmen who have been given the moniker ""boliburgues"" along with several Venezuelan officials allegedly embezzled more than $1.2 billion from Venezuela's state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA) between 2014 and 2015, and later attempted to launder the funds through US and European banks, according to a July 23 criminal complaint filed in a federal court in Florida. The PdVSA officials and businesspeople involved allegedly exploited Venezuela's foreign currency exchange system to increase the value of company funds obtained from the oil company through bribery and fraud. Because of differences between the actual exchange rate and a government-set rate, connected individuals in Venezuela could steal huge amounts of money from the PdVSA. ""Essentially, in two transactions, [a] person could buy 100 million U.S. Dollars for 10 million U.S. Dollars,"" the complaint states. This is all possible thanks to the inconsistencies and complexities of Venezuela's currency exchange system. After allegedly obtaining $1.2 billion from PdVSA, the defendants laundered the money through a series of sophisticated schemes, including the purchase of real estate in Florida, fake bonds and false investment funds, in order to pay kickbacks to Venezuelan officials and elites. Most of the defendants named in the complaint remain at large, and a number of them are presumably in Venezuela where there is little chance the government will cooperate with the US prosecution. However, the US Justice Department announced in a statement that two arrests had been made in connection with the case. One was Matthias Krull, a Panama-based German national living in Venezuela who worked for a Swiss bank managing the accounts of Venezuelan elites. He allegedly conspired to launder part of the money embezzled from PdVSA, and was arrested in Miami on July 24. Gustavo Adolfo Hernandez Frieri, a Colombian national and naturalized US citizen who allegedly laundered part of the embezzled funds with false mutual fund investments, was arrested in Italy on July 25. Venezuelan elite Francisco Convit Guruceaga, former legal counsel for Venezuela's mining ministry Carmelo Urdaneta Aqui, Venezuelan ""professional money launderer"" Jose Vicente Amparan Croquer, former PdVSA finance director Abraham Eduardo Ortega, Portuguese banker Hugo Andre Ramalho Gois and Uruguayan banker Marcelo Federico Gutierrez Acosta y Lara have also been charged in the case. In the criminal complaint, US authorities also describe several unnamed conspirators who are part of a Venezuelan elite class known as the ""bolichicos"" or ""boliburgues,"" a name Venezuelans have given to the social class that has rapidly grown rich due to its political ties or the business it does with the Chavista government. The list also includes a television network owner who could be Raul Gorrin of Globovision according to the Miami Herald , and the stepsons of an important Venezuelan official, who according to the same source could be President Nicolas Maduro himself and the children of his wife Cilia Flores. Members of the boliburgues have been implicated in a wide range of other corruption schemes throughout government institutions. The billion-dollar scheme to embezzle funds from Venezuela's state-owned oil company and launder them through a sophisticated series of false investments abroad is the latest example of the pervasive corruption that has pillaged not only PdVSA, but much of the Venezuelan government's coffers in recent years. ""It happens because this economic model was created precisely so that organized crime would have control of Venezuela,"" Venezuelan lawyer and organized crime expert Alejandro Rebolledo told InSight Crime. In Rebolledo's opinion, the economic model led to certain people having the control to give authorization for the currency to leave the coffers of the PdVSA and the nation in general, justified by alleged purchases and payments to suppliers. This explains the sudden ""enrichment"" of the boliburgueses to the tune of $600 million or more. Interestingly, the PdVSA negotiations that led to the US investigations into alleged money laundering began on December 23, 2014, just seven days before President Nicolas Maduro appointed former Treasurer of the Nation Carlos Erick Malpica Flores as vice president of finance for PdVSA. Malpica is also first lady Cilia Flores' nephew. The Bolichicos' transactions with the oil company continued into 2015, when Malpica ran the office where the transactions were made. But the recently revealed money laundering case is not the first time PdVSA officials have been accused of involvement in billion-dollar kickback schemes. In 2015, US federal prosecutors brought a case against two US businessmen who allegedly paid bribes to PdVSA officials in exchange for help winning contracts from the oil company. That case was expanded in 2017 when prosecutors charged several former Venezuelan government officials with soliciting tens of millions of dollars in bribe payments in exchange for prioritizing payments from the failing oil company to certain contractors. Moreover, PdVSA is not the only government institution in Venezuela subject to rampant corruption. As InSight Crime revealed in a recent investigation , virtually any potential avenue for graft is being exploited while the government of President Maduro turns a blind eye to secure the loyalty of those around him. Cases include members of the armed forces, members of the first family and possibly even the president, who according to the Miami Herald may have participated in the PdVSA money laundering operation, although he is not mentioned by name in the US investigation report. Rebolledo, author of the book ""How Money Is Laundered in Venezuela"" (""Asi se lava el dinero en Venezuela""), told InSight Crime that ""these money laundering operations are only possible if someone in an important position of power allows them to happen. That is what leads to a network like the one identified by US authorities being formed."""	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
"Colombia Homicide Case Points to FARC-Sinaloa Cartel Links. The recent murder of a Colombian official has brought to light a criminal coalition in which local businessmen, Mexican drug traffickers, and the Urabenos work with the FARC guerrillas to launder drug money and move cocaine. Celia Escobar Florez, a top inspector for Colombia's tax and customs agency, known by its Spanish acronym DIAN, in the southwestern Huila province, was murdered on May 10 in the province capital Neiva. According to newspaper El Tiempo , police believe her murder was ordered by a local businessman -- who officials requested remain anonymous -- after she refused to accept bribes to halt investigations into suspected money laundering operations. Prosecutors believe the businessman is involved in laundering money for the Teofilo Forero Column of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and also serves as a contact for the FARC with Mexico's Sinaloa and Gulf Cartels. According to El Tiempo, the businessman has a style reminiscent of Pablo Escobar, investing in extravagant public works projects while rubbing shoulders with the Huila elite. Officials say the Huila town of Pitalito is a key center of money laundering operations, and is also home to two important drug traffickers linked to the rebels -- Mexican citizen alias ""El Sinaloeno,"" who serves as a contact between Mexico and the head of the Teofilo Forero Column, and alias ""Patrocinio,"" a member of the Urabenos believed to be helping the Mexicans obtain FARC cocaine. The current report illustrates a FARC strategy common to criminal organizations of using well-connected middlemen -- often with connections to multiple groups -- to facilitate the movement of drugs and money and to organize money laundering schemes. The report also serves to highlight the FARC's international connections, something also evidenced by the fact that an estimated 70 percent of the guerrilla organization's assets are held outside Colombia. Seized computer files showed FARC links with the Sinaloa Cartel date back to at least 2010; a more recent report indicated that the guerrilla organization has been selling off its drug franchises to the Mexican organization. Established FARC-Urabenos drug connections have evolved as well, with the neo-paramilitary group reportedly taking over some of the FARC's drug trafficking operations."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
"Ecuador Bulk Cash Smuggling Reflects New Laundering Trend. Ecuador has witnessed a dramatic rise in bulk cash smuggling over the last five years, reflecting evolutions in criminal groups' money laundering and trafficking practices away from established financial institutions. In 2008, Ecuadorean security forces seized $545,000 being illegally smuggled across its borders, according to figures collected for a report by El Comercio. By 2012, these seizure numbers had risen to $1.9 million and 215,000 Euros. Throughout the entire period, authorities seized over $10 million, 4 millon Euros (approximately $5 million) and smaller quantities of pesos from Colombia, Chile, Cuba and the Dominican Republic. Police arrested 79 people for cash smuggling at Quito and Guayaquil airports over that same time period. However, although 70 criminal cases were opened, only six resulted in convictions, while 18 people were acquitted and 28 of the cases were dismissed. Police estimate that for every one person they capture, five more make it across the border safely. Cases have been hampered by fuzzily defined legal requirements for prosecutors to prove the illicit origins of the money. Judges have also been inconsistent in their interpretation of the laws. El Comercio, for instance, chronicles the case of three Ecuadoreans, who were arrested in Quito airport in 2011, coming from the Netherlands with 180,000 Euros each, hidden in their crotches. They were convicted of money laundering, but the ruling was overturned on appeal after a judge determined prosecutors had not adequately shown the origins of the cash. The money was returned to the men, minus a 30 percent fine for not declaring it. The figures cited above do not include seizures made by Ecuador's Customs Service, which, according to an off-the-record source consulted by El Comercio, made 50 more stops. However, customs officials were powerless to do anything except fine the smugglers 30 percent of the haul and return the rest of the cash. According to an anonymous police investigator cited by El Comercio, while over 90 percent of the money was seized at the country's airports, cash smuggling by air represents just a fraction of the money smuggled in and out of Ecuador. The majority, the source says, is moved across land and maritime borders, where it is more difficult to effectively monitor crossings. According to US law enforcement agencies, criminal organizations have increasingly turned to bulk cash smuggling as a result of the crackdown on money laundering operations through the established financial industry. There are two principal methods used to smuggle cash. One is bulk shipments in commercial vehicles, the other is the ""ruta hormiga,"" or ""ant route,"" which sees cash shipments broken down, smuggled across the border by individuals carrying $5,000-10,000, then reconsolidated on the other side. According to a 2010 Woodrow Wilson institute study into Mexican cartel's cash smuggling operations, cash smuggling may be ""in-sourced"" -- managed internally by cartel members -- or ""outsourced"" -- contracted out to independent smugglers or money brokers. Most seizures occur at airports but, as suggested by the Ecuadorean police, this is likely a reflection of better facilities for checking baggage rather than an indication it is a more popular route. Cash smuggling routes generally follow the same paths taken by drugs but in reverse, frequently using the same personnel, contacts and transport infrastructure. As such, by far and away the most popular route with drug traffickers is crossing the Mexico-United States border, where estimates for the amount of cash smuggled vary wildly -- from $6 billion to $36 billion a year, according to the Wilson Center report. However, evolutions in both drug trafficking and money laundering are popularizing other transit routes as well -- including through Ecuador. According to the Wilson Center report, Mexican cartels increasingly look to bypass their home country when moving money that will be reinvested in paying for more cocaine, instead moving the cash to Colombia and Ecuador. To do this the cartels sometimes use international criminal groups based in Russia and China as smugglers. This method has helped Mexican cartels cut out the middle-men who move drugs into Mexico and purchase cocaine closer to the source. This includes Ecuador, where the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) -- who manage much of the cocaine distribution chain in Colombia but have little to do with exports -- have a strong presence and can sell cocaine cultivated and processed in the south of Colombia. The United States has responded to the growth in cash smuggling with stronger legislation. In the 2001 Patriot Act, the government criminalized international bulk cash smuggling for amounts over $10,000, introducing sentences of up to five years imprisonment and provisions for the seizure of all cash and goods discovered at the time or traced to the operation. Responsibility for enforcing the new legislation fell to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), which established the National Bulk Cash Smuggling Center. From the fiscal year of 2003 to 2010, ICE agents seized over $500 million dollars -- nearly 20 percent of which came in 2010 -- and arrested over 1,300 people. In 2005, ICE, along with the Customs and Border Protection agency (CBP) launched "" Operation Firewall ,"" which targets cash smuggling in the United States and works with international partners abroad. The US approach goes some way to closing the legal loopholes that have seen cash smugglers in Ecuador not only escape unpunished but also with much of the money. However, while cracking down on cash smuggling may disrupt cartels' revenue streams, it leaves their operational capacity barely touched, as arrests are unlikely to ever move beyond mules -- the bottom rung of the drug trafficking chain. Meanwhile, the cartels continue to evolve. As low tech methods such as cash smuggling and pre-paid cards have grown in popularity, there are signs that so has the use of new money laundering techniques that instead focus on opportunities to be found in an increasingly high tech and connected world, underscoring the Sisyphean nature of stopping the flows of drugs and cash."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
"Argentina Targets Chinese Mafia with Operation Dragons Head. A joint operation by Argentine and Chinese authorities rounded up dozens of suspects with alleged ties to the ""Chinese Mafia,"" a move that officials described as an important blow against the criminal organization in Argentina. In a June 13 press release , the Argentine Security Ministry announced the detention of 40 suspects in ""Operation Dragon's Head,"" which was carried out by the Federal Police with the support of the Chinese police and the Chinese embassy in Argentina. Clarin reported that 34 of the 40 suspects were undocumented Chinese immigrants. The Security Ministry said that Peruvians, Bolivians and Argentineans also belonged to the crime group. Thirty-one of those arrested have been released from custody, though they are still under investigation. The suspects are accused of crimes that include extortion and violation of weapons and drugs laws. The Security Ministry said the operation resulted in the confiscation of 14 firearms, four vehicles, several thousand dollars in cash, and unspecified quantities of drugs and cell phones, along with computers and accounting records. Local media reports identified the targeted organization by the name ""Pixiu,"" which refers to a mythical "" fortune beast "" from Chinese folklore. A police source described the Pixiu group to La Nacion as ""the biggest, most important and most violent Chinese mafia."" Security Secretary Eugenio Burazco said the group's leader, identified by Infobae as A Di, ""has a history, and his father is the head of the mafia in China."" According to Infobae, the Pixiu used a trade organization purporting to represent Chinese businesses in Buenos Aires province as a cover for the group's illegal activities, which focused heavily on extorting local Chinese businesses. The news outlet reported that the Pixiu demanded an initial fee of $50,000 from businesses seeking the group's ""protection,"" and charged each business a recurring fee of about $3,600 per month. The total amount of money the group earned from its illegal activities remains unclear. Those who refuse or fail to pay extortion fees are often targeted for violent reprisal. A recent government report linked Chinese organized crime groups to at least 37 attacks against owners and employees of Chinese businesses in Buenos Aires since 2009. Argentine officials hailed the arrest of dozens of suspects and the seizure of records related the Pixiu's illicit business as an important blow against the group. This may be true, but according to a 2014 report , several other powerful ""Chinese mafia"" groups operate in Argentina, and there are several factors that complicate efforts to combat them. Linguistic and cultural barriers can make it difficult for Argentine authorities to investigate Chinese organized crime activities. For Operation Dragon's Head, Infobae reported , the Argentine police had to bring on a police officer from the Chinese embassy to work the case undercover. Also, Chinese immigrants -- especially those without regularized migration status -- are often reluctant to cooperate with local authorities on investigations of fellow Chinese. As InSight Crime has previously pointed out , Chinese organized crime groups are also active in several other Latin American countries. The expansion of political and economic ties between China and Latin America likely means that these groups will continue to grow and develop ties with other criminal actors in the region. In light of this reality, the cooperation between local authorities and their Chinese counterparts seen in Operation Dragon's Head may provide a useful model for future operations against Chinese organized crime groups in Latin America."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"Rios Police Face Reality Check in Un-Pacified Favela. Brazil's elite military police are trying to build ties with communities and undo the harm done by officers who allegedly abused residents in Complexo da Mare, a favela which has not yet come under police control, reports blogger Julia Michaels. Since the 2008 start of Rio's new public safety policy, BOPE, the military police elite squad, has met with community members, but never like this. First of all, the cops weren't even invited. ""When we saw you coming in, the first thing we thought was, 'They're going to prevent us from meeting',"" said Rubens Casara, a judge active on human rights issues. ""The second was, 'They're going to try to keep people from making accusations about police behavior',"" he told three elite squad members who came, it turned out, to actually listen and respond to residents. Second, the reason everybody was crammed into a large classroom at the Observatorio de Favelas NGO in the Nova Holanda section of the Mare complex of favelas in Rio's North Zone was Rio's first cable-stayed bridge -- not the sort of thing that normally figures into public safety strategies. Brazil, land of contrasts Set to open to vehicle traffic next month, the ultra-modern $176 million equivalent bridge is taking shape by way of the machinery and men of the Queiroz Galvao construction company. It will connect the ""Red Line"" highway to UFRJ, the federal university campus where two other engineering feats are coming to life: the $500 million GE research and development center , and a $300 million equivalent research center where the university and several other companies will develop pre-salt oil exploration technology. Third, the closest ""community"", as the politically correct like to call favelas, the Complexo da Mare, isn't pacified. So not pacified is it that on October 10, an unidentified number of armed drug traffickers reportedly showed up at the construction site, demanding two million reais ($1.2 million, equivalent) in exchange for a peaceful construction environment. So what did the elite squad do, to make sure the bridge will be finished on time? They dropped pamphlets out of a helicopter, asking Mare residents for their help, and sent 120 men into the area to find the extortionists. Except that the pamphlets (leftovers from another favela) erroneously said the area was being pacified, the extortionist chase wasn't mentioned until today, and, residents say, the men have been searching homes without knocking, shooting their weapons without regard for passersby, and generally terrorizing people. ""Their search warrants are their uniforms,"" said one resident. ""They say, 'What are you looking at?' and don't wear nametags,"" as required. ""There are from 400 to 500 drug traffickers here,"" said Jailson de Souza, founder of the Observatorio, which has a strong focus on human rights. ""And anywhere from 140,000 to 150,000 people live here, altogether. But the soldiers seem to think of all this as enemy territory"". Blonde-ponytailed Captain Marlisa (no last name given, per Brazilian habit) said she'd give out her contact information, so residents can report police misdeeds. ""I need this kind of feedback,"" she said. Officers are supposed to wear nametags, and may only enter private property with a search warrant, or when catching a criminal in the act. Can another sort of bridge be built? All three BOPE officers appeared to sincerely want to improve communication and to work together with the community. In favelas with new police pacification units -- from all accounts the only places where the elite squad has sat down to exchange ideas with locals -- this posture has worked fairly well. But Complexo da Mare is another world, without peace, a true test of police training and performance. Lieutenant Alexandra Vicente, a corps psychologist, said investigations would be carried out and that soldiers found to have abused their authority could be fired in as little time as a month. De Souza recognized that the state public safety policy represents a change of paradigm, with the corps being trained in community policing, the retaking of territories until now dominated by criminals, and the establishment so far of 17 police pacification units. ""But what's going on here is the old paradigm,"" he concluded. Health workers present at the meeting said the stress on the local population has brought on increases in hypertension, diabetes and, in children, psychosomatic fevers. A teacher complained of a machine-gunned wall. Charles Guimaraes, president of the Baixa do Sapateiro neighborhood association, said that the police didn't stop to help a woman he claims they shot. The bridge extortion attempt brings up questions about the geography of the huge Complex and just which one of three drug gangs might be responsible. The area where BOPE has been active for the last 10 days isn't contiguous to the building site. But the police do have intelligence and a strategy, Lt. Vicente assured RioRealblog. ""We're not just saying, oh, let's go here today,"" she added. Intelligence isn't likely to be coming from residents, both wary and weary of the way they're being treated. They demanded, above all, that actual police behavior match the prescribed one. Police are known to fabricate in flagrante delicto crime scenes by providing drugs. ""What am I going to say [when a cop conducts a search without a warrant, or hits a resident, for example], 'I'm going to tell Captain Marlisa on you'?"" asked a meeting participant. After the meeting, 30 NGOs, neighborhood associations, community projects, municipal health clinics and a city school released a document demanding an immediate meeting with the State Public Safety Secretariat, with the BOPE command, and the local battalion commander; a communique from BOPE to residents explaining the current incursion and describing legally correct police behavior; the investigation of all human rights violations reported to BOPE; and the immediate suspension of the current operation until the above requests are fulfilled.

"Guatemala Criminal Profits May Not Amount to Much. According to new figures released by Guatemala's Attorney General's Office, the amount of money that criminal groups make from extortion, kidnapping, and hired killings pale in comparison to the cash involved in several recent corruption scandals. The Attorney General's Office told newspaper La Hora that a single criminal group may collect up to 135,000 quetzales (about $17,500) a month in extortion profits, which adds up to about $210,000 in yearly earnings for that criminal group. La Hora's report did not include the Attorney General's estimate for total potential earnings from extortion, but the Interior Ministry has said that it may be worth up to $61 million a year. This figure includes estimated earnings from so-called ""express"" kidnappings, in which the victim is held hostage for only a short period of time. According to the Attorney General Office numbers reported by La Hora, prosecutors have registered cases in which families pay kidnap ransoms ranging from $130 to $3,250. Guatemala's head organized crime prosecutor told the newspaper that in many cases, kidnappers will start out demanding 1 million quetzales (about $130,000) in ransom, but will lower their demands significantly during negotiations if prosecutors and the police become involved. Another significant source of income for criminal groups is hired killings. The head of the Attorney General criminal investigations unit told La Hora that up to 38 percent of Guatemala's homicides may have been committed by contract killers, who may earn between $13 to $26,000 for doing so. A contract killer previously interviewed by La Hora said he had charged between $910 to about $3,250 for his work, with the price falling or increasing depending on whether he was provided with the murder weapon or not. Assigning an estimated total worth to underworld activities like extortion and kidnapping is a tricky business. Government agencies typically risk underestimating the profits at stake, partly because a significant number of people may not be reporting the crime. The Attorney General Office estimates suggest that the potential earnings from extortion, kidnapping, and contract killings are nothing to laugh at. Still, these amounts look skimpy compared to the reported profits involved in recent state corruption schemes. The customs fraud ring led by Guatemala's ex-president and vice president stole over $3 million in state funds within a year, according to the Attorney General's Office. In another case unveiled this year , a candidate for the vice presidency was implicated in a money laundering scheme that may have involved up to $121 million in laundered funds. While Guatemala must certainly continue to work towards improving public security by battling extortion and kidnapping, authorities have done well to turn their attention this year to corrupt elites who are also raking in huge profits."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
"FARC Release Kidnapped Chinese Oil Workers. The FARC has released four Chinese citizens who were kidnapped in June last year, a piece of good publicity for the rebels after claims that they had broken a unilateral two-month ceasefire within 24 hours. Three oil contractors and one translator were handed over by rebels to a delegation from the International Red Cross on November 21 in San Vicente del Caguan, in the southern province of Caqueta, reported El Tiempo. They were kidnapped on June 8, 2011, close to San Vicente del Caguan, when Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas stopped the car they were traveling in. One month after the kidnapping, the rebel group demanded a $3 million ransom payment from their employers (Great Western Drilling Company, which is sub-contracted by the UK firm Emerald Energy) to secure their release. It is unclear whether any payment was made. All four hostages are reported to be in good health. The FARC announced in February that they would cease kidnapping for ransom. This move was followed by the April release of the 10 remaining members of Colombia's security forces who they were holding in captivity, which was seen as a sign of the guerrilla group's will to negotiate peace with the government. Talks began in Oslo last month and moved to Havana on November 19. Despite the fact that the FARC no longer hold security personnel, many civilians kidnapped by the guerrillas for the purpose of extortion remain unaccounted for. The NGO Fundacion Pais Libre estimated earlier this year that over 400 members of the public were still being held by the FARC. Jaime Alberto Parra, alias ""El Medico,"" a member of the rebel group's peace delegation, declared in September , ""Now, there is no longer anybody retained by us."" One possible reason for releasing the Chinese hostages now would be to cast the FARC in a favorable light. The group declared that they would observe a unilateral two month ceasefire beginning November 20. However, this has reportedly already been broken after two guerrillas allegedly attacked soldiers in the southwest province of Cauca."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
